Overall, we advocate for the development of NeuroAI, a type of Neuroscience-informed Artificial Intelligence that, we argue, has the potential for significantly improving the scope and efficiency of AI algorithms while simultaneously changing the way we understand biological neural computations. We include personal statements from several leading researchers on their diverse views of NeuroAI.

Existing category-theoretic planners provide compositional structure and pullback-based hard-constraint verification, but treat applicability as crisp, forcing thresholding that collapses meaningful distinctions and cannot track quality degradation across multi-step plans. We propose Fuzzy Category-theoretic Planning (FCP), which annotates each action (morphism) with a degree in [0,1], composes plan quality via a t-norm Lukasiewicz, and retains crisp executability checks via pullback verification. FCP grounds graded applicability from language using an LLM with k-sample median aggregation and supports meeting-in-the-middle search using residuum-based backward requirements. We evaluate on (i) public PDDL3 preference/oversubscription benchmarks and (ii) RecipeNLG-Subs, a missing-substitute recipe-planning benchmark built from RecipeNLG with substitution candidates from Recipe1MSubs and FoodKG.

We therefore aim to develop Insight Agents (IA), a conversational multi-agent Data Insight system, to provide E-commerce sellers with personalized data and business insights through automated information retrieval. Our hypothesis is that IA will serve as a force multiplier for sellers, thereby driving incremental seller adoption by reducing the effort required and increase speed at which sellers make good business decisions. In this paper, we introduce this novel LLM-backed end-to-end agentic system built on a plan-and-execute paradigm and designed for comprehensive coverage, high accuracy, and low latency. It features a hierarchical multi-agent structure, consisting of manager agent and two worker agents: data presentation and insight generation, for efficient information retrieval and problem-solving. We design a simple yet effective ML solution for manager agent that combines Out-of-Domain (OOD) detection using a lightweight encoder-decoder model and agent routing through a BERT-based classifier, optimizing both accuracy and latency. Within the two worker agents, a strategic planning is designed for API-based data model that breaks down queries into granular components to generate more accurate responses, and domain knowledge is dynamically injected to to enhance the insight generator. IA has been launched for Amazon sellers in US, which has achieved high accuracy of 90% based on human evaluation, with latency of P90 below 15s.",

However, traditional change detection methods based on remote sensing imagery have obvious limitations in high-level and intelligent analysis, and thus are difficult to meet the requirements of current urban planning and management. In face of the growing demand for complex multi-modal data analysis in urban park development monitoring, these methods often fail to provide flexible analysis capabilities for diverse application scenarios. This study proposes a multi-modal LLM agent framework, which aims to make full use of the semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities of LLM to meet the challenges in urban park development monitoring. In this framework, a general horizontal and vertical data alignment mechanism is designed to ensure the consistency and effective tracking of multi-modal data. At the same time, a specific toolkit is constructed to alleviate the hallucination issues of LLM due to the lack of domain-specific knowledge. Compared to vanilla GPT-4o and other agents, our approach enables robust multi-modal information fusion and analysis, offering reliable and scalable solutions tailored to the diverse and evolving demands of urban park development monitoring.",

We introduce $\\method$, an agentic framework that addresses these limitations by training medical reasoning verifiers to iteratively query external medical corpora during evaluation. Our approach combines tool-augmented verification with an iterative reinforcement learning paradigm that requires only trace-level supervision, alongside an adaptive curriculum mechanism that dynamically adjusts training data distribution. Across four medical reasoning benchmarks, $\\method$ achieves substantial gains over existing methods, improving MedQA accuracy by 23.5% and MedXpertQA by 32.0% relative to the base generator in particular. Crucially, $\\method$ demonstrates an $\\mathbf{8\\times}$ reduction in sampling budget requirement compared to prior reward model baselines.

To bridge this gap, we propose Endogenous Reprompting, a mechanism that transforms the model's understanding from a passive encoding process into an explicit generative reasoning step by generating self-aligned descriptors during generation. To achieve this, we introduce SEER (Self-Evolving Evaluator and Reprompter), a training framework that establishes a two-stage endogenous loop using only 300 samples from a compact proxy task, Visual Instruction Elaboration. First, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) activates the model's latent evaluation ability via curriculum learning, producing a high-fidelity endogenous reward signal. Second, Reinforcement Learning with Model-rewarded Thinking (RLMT) leverages this signal to optimize the generative reasoning policy.

Benefiting from the strong capabilities of LLMs, recent research focus has shifted from simple context extension to the development of dedicated agentic memory systems. However, existing approaches typically rely on rigid retrieval granularity, accumulation-heavy maintenance strategies, and coarse-grained update mechanisms. These design choices create a persistent mismatch between stored information and task-specific reasoning demands, while leading to the unchecked accumulation of logical inconsistencies over time. To address these challenges, we propose Adaptive Memory via Multi-Agent Collaboration (AMA), a novel framework that leverages coordinated agents to manage memory across multiple granularities. AMA employs a hierarchical memory design that dynamically aligns retrieval granularity with task complexity. Specifically, the Constructor and Retriever jointly enable multi-granularity memory construction and adaptive query routing. The Judge verifies the relevance and consistency of retrieved content, triggering iterative retrieval when evidence is insufficient or invoking the Refresher upon detecting logical conflicts. The Refresher then enforces memory consistency by performing targeted updates or removing outdated entries. Extensive experiments on challenging long-context benchmarks show that AMA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines while reducing token consumption by approximately 80% compared to full-context methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in maintaining retrieval precision and long-term memory consistency.",

We introduce Policy of Thoughts (PoT), a framework that recasts reasoning as a within-instance online optimization process. PoT first generates diverse candidate solutions via an efficient exploration mechanism, then uses Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to update a transient LoRA adapter based on execution feedback. This closed-loop design enables dynamic, instance-specific refinement of the model's reasoning priors.

Building an effective GUI agent model relies on two factors: (1) high-quality data and (2) effective training methods. To address these, we introduce a carefully engineered data-construction pipeline and a decoupled training paradigm. For data construction, we leverage rigorously curated open-source datasets and introduce a novel automated synthesis framework that integrates bottom-up autonomous exploration with top-down taxonomy-guided generation to create high-fidelity synthetic data. For training, to better leverage these data, we adopt a two-stage strategy: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to establish fundamental interaction syntax, followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to improve spatial grounding and sequential planning. To balance computational efficiency with agentic reasoning capacity, OmegaUse is built on a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) backbone. To evaluate cross-terminal capabilities in an offline setting, we introduce OS-Nav, a benchmark suite spanning multiple operating systems: ChiM-Nav, targeting Chinese Android mobile environments, and Ubu-Nav, focusing on routine desktop interactions on Ubuntu. Extensive experiments show that OmegaUse is highly competitive across established GUI benchmarks, achieving a state-of-the-art (SOTA) score of 96.3% on ScreenSpot-V2 and a leading 79.1% step success rate on AndroidControl. OmegaUse also performs strongly on OS-Nav, reaching 74.24% step success on ChiM-Nav and 55.9% average success on Ubu-Nav.",

Existing methods either shorten CoTs at the semantic level, which is often conservative, or prune tokens aggressively, which can miss task-critical cues and degrade accuracy. Moreover, combining the two is non-trivial due to sequential dependency, task-agnostic pruning, and distribution mismatch. We propose \\textbf{CtrlCoT}, a dual-granularity CoT compression framework that harmonizes semantic abstraction and token-level pruning through three components: Hierarchical Reasoning Abstraction produces CoTs at multiple semantic granularities; Logic-Preserving Distillation trains a logic-aware pruner to retain indispensable reasoning cues (e.g., numbers and operators) across pruning ratios; and Distribution-Alignment Generation aligns compressed traces with fluent inference-time reasoning styles to avoid fragmentation. On MATH-500 with Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, CtrlCoT uses 30.7\\% fewer tokens while achieving 7.6 percentage points higher than the strongest baseline, demonstrating more efficient and reliable reasoning.

        "abstract": "The introduction of artificial intelligence (AI) agents into human group settings raises essential questions about how these novel participants influence cooperative social norms. While previous studies on human-AI cooperation have primarily focused on dyadic interactions, little is known about how integrating AI agents affects the emergence and maintenance of cooperative norms in small groups. This study addresses this gap through an online experiment using a repeated four-player Public Goods Game (PGG). Each group consisted of three human participants and one bot, which was framed either as human or AI and followed one of three predefined decision strategies: unconditional cooperation, conditional cooperation, or free-riding. In our sample of 236 participants, we found that reciprocal group dynamics and behavioural inertia primarily drove cooperation. These normative mechanisms operated identically across conditions, resulting in cooperation levels that did not differ significantly between human and AI labels. Furthermore, we found no evidence of differences in norm persistence in a follow-up Prisoner's Dilemma, or in participants' normative perceptions. Participants' behaviour followed the same normative logic across human and AI conditions, indicating that cooperation depended on group behaviour rather than partner identity. This supports a pattern of normative equivalence, in which the mechanisms that sustain cooperation function similarly in mixed human-AI and all human groups. These findings suggest that cooperative norms are flexible enough to extend to artificial agents, blurring the boundary between humans and AI in collective decision-making.",

We propose a novel multi-agent reasoning framework, referred to as Planning through World Model for Automated Heuristic Design via Self-Evolving LLMs (PathWise), which formulates heuristic generation as a sequential decision process over an entailment graph serving as a compact, stateful memory of the search trajectory. This approach allows the system to carry forward past decisions and reuse or avoid derivation information across generations. A policy agent plans evolutionary actions, a world model agent generates heuristic rollouts conditioned on those actions, and critic agents provide routed reflections summarizing lessons from prior steps, shifting LLM-based AHD from trial-and-error evolution toward state-aware planning through reasoning. Experiments across diverse COPs show that PathWise converges faster to better heuristics, generalizes across different LLM backbones, and scales to larger problem sizes.",

Building on this foundation, three widely used online planning algorithms--Sparse Sampling, Particle Filter Trees with Double Progressive Widening (PFT-DPW), and Partially Observable Monte Carlo Planning with Observation Widening (POMCPOW)--are extended to optimize the ICVaR value function rather than the expectation of the return. Our formulations introduce a risk parameter $\\alpha$, where $\\alpha = 1$ recovers standard expectation-based planning and $\\alpha < 1$ induces increasing risk aversion. For ICVaR Sparse Sampling, we establish finite-time performance guarantees under the risk-sensitive objective, which further enable a novel exploration strategy tailored to ICVaR.

Drawing on Peace Studies traditions - particularly interest-based negotiation, conflict transformation, and commons governance - we operationalize Viral Collaborative Wisdom (VCW), an approach that reframes alignment from a control problem to a relationship problem developed through dialogical reasoning. Our experimental design assigns four distinct roles (Proposer, Responder, Monitor, Translator) to different AI systems across six conditions, testing whether current large language models can engage substantively with complex alignment frameworks. Using Claude, Gemini, and GPT-4o, we conducted 72 dialogue turns totaling 576,822 characters of structured exchange. Results demonstrate that AI systems can engage meaningfully with Peace Studies concepts, surface complementary objections from different architectural perspectives, and generate emergent insights not present in initial framings - including the novel synthesis of \"VCW as transitional framework.\" Cross-architecture patterns reveal that different models foreground different concerns: Claude emphasized verification challenges, Gemini focused on bias and scalability, and GPT-4o highlighted implementation barriers. The framework provides researchers with replicable methods for stress-testing alignment proposals before implementation, while the findings offer preliminary evidence about AI capacity for the kind of dialogical reasoning VCW proposes. We discuss limitations, including the observation that dialogues engaged more with process elements than with foundational claims about AI nature, and outline directions for future research including human-AI hybrid protocols and extended dialogue studies.",

However, we identify a systematic lack of emphasis on more challenging questions in existing methods from both algorithmic and data perspectives, despite their importance for refining underdeveloped capabilities. Algorithmically, widely used Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) suffers from an implicit imbalance where the magnitude of policy updates is lower for harder questions. Data-wise, augmentation approaches primarily rephrase questions to enhance diversity without systematically increasing intrinsic difficulty. To address these issues, we propose a two-dual MathForge framework to improve mathematical reasoning by targeting harder questions from both perspectives, which comprises a Difficulty-Aware Group Policy Optimization (DGPO) algorithm and a Multi-Aspect Question Reformulation (MQR) strategy. Specifically, DGPO first rectifies the implicit imbalance in GRPO via difficulty-balanced group advantage estimation, and further prioritizes harder questions by difficulty-aware question-level weighting. Meanwhile, MQR reformulates questions across multiple aspects to increase difficulty while maintaining the original gold answer. Overall, MathForge forms a synergistic loop: MQR expands the data frontier, and DGPO effectively learns from the augmented data. Extensive experiments show that MathForge significantly outperforms existing methods on various mathematical reasoning tasks. The code and augmented data are all available at this https URL.",

To investigate these aspects, we use a referential-game framework in which vision-language model (VLM) agents communicate, providing a controlled, measurable setting for evaluating language variants. Experiments show that VLMs can develop effective, task-adapted communication patterns. At the same time, they can develop covert protocols that are difficult for humans and external agents to interpret. We also observe spontaneous coordination between similar models without explicitly shared protocols. These findings highlight both the potential and the risks of task-oriented communication, and position referential games as a valuable testbed for future work in this area.",

Although this compositional paradigm has shown superior performance in domains such as reasoning, planning, and verification, its deployment remains challenging due to severe inefficiencies in symbolic and probabilistic inference. Through systematic analysis of representative neuro-symbolic workloads, we identify probabilistic logical reasoning as the inefficiency bottleneck, characterized by irregular control flow, low arithmetic intensity, uncoalesced memory accesses, and poor hardware utilization on CPUs and GPUs. This paper presents REASON, an integrated acceleration framework for probabilistic logical reasoning in neuro-symbolic AI. REASON introduces a unified directed acyclic graph representation that captures common structure across symbolic and probabilistic models, coupled with adaptive pruning and regularization. At the architecture level, REASON features a reconfigurable, tree-based processing fabric optimized for irregular traversal, symbolic deduction, and probabilistic aggregation. At the system level, REASON is tightly integrated with GPU streaming multiprocessors through a programmable interface and multi-level pipeline that efficiently orchestrates compositional execution. Evaluated across six neuro-symbolic workloads, REASON achieves 12-50x speedup and 310-681x energy efficiency over desktop and edge GPUs under TSMC 28 nm node. REASON enables real-time probabilistic logical reasoning, completing end-to-end tasks in 0.8 s with 6 mm2 area and 2.12 W power, demonstrating that targeted acceleration of probabilistic logical reasoning is critical for practical and scalable neuro-symbolic AI and positioning REASON as a foundational system architecture for next-generation cognitive intelligence.",

In this work, we propose MemCtrl, a novel framework that uses Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for pruning memory online.

We evaluate with training two types of \\mu, 1) via an offline expert, and 2) via online RL, and observe significant improvement in overall embodied task completion ability on \\mu-augmented MLLMs. In particular, on augmenting two low performing MLLMs with MemCtrl on multiple subsets of the EmbodiedBench benchmark, we observe that \\mu-augmented MLLMs show an improvement of around 16% on average, with over 20% on specific instruction subsets. Finally, we present a qualitative analysis on the memory fragments collected by \\mu, noting the superior performance of \\mu augmented MLLMs on long and complex instruction types.",

Our system utilizes two key innovations: Sequential Research Plan Refinement via Reflection and a Candidates Crossover algorithm. The sequential refinement process is demonstrated as an efficient method that allows the agent to maintain a centralized Global Research Context, enabling it to look back at current progress, reason about the research plan, and intelligently make changes at runtime. This dynamic adaptation contrasts with parallel approaches, which often suffer from siloed knowledge. The Candidates Crossover algorithm further enhances search efficiency by deploying multiple LLM candidates with varied parameters to explore a larger search space, with their findings synthesized to curate a comprehensive final research response. The process concludes with One Shot Report Generation, ensuring the final document is informed by a unified narrative and high fact density. Powered by the Gemini 2.5 Pro model, our Deep Researcher was evaluated on the DeepResearch Bench, a globally recognized benchmark of 100 doctoral level research tasks.

In this work, we provide a systematic assessment of the planning and long-horizon reasoning capabilities of state-of-the-art Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). We propose a novel benchmark based on Sokoban puzzles, intentionally simplified to isolate long-horizon planning from state persistence. Our findings reveal a consistent degradation in planning performance when more than 25 moves are required to reach the solution, suggesting a fundamental constraint on forward planning capacity. We show that equipping LRMs with Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) parsing, validation, and solving tools allows for modest improvements, suggesting inherent architectural limitations which might not be overcome by test-time scaling approaches alone.",

While prior work has examined GPU reliability, most studies have focused on general-purpose applications or conventional neural networks mostly used for vision tasks such as classification and detection. In contrast, systematic analysis of modern large-scale LLMs remains limited, despite their rapid adoption in diverse application scenarios. Given the unique characteristics of LLMs, their resilience to soft errors may differ substantially from earlier models. To bridge this gap, we conduct the first instruction-level fault injection study of LLM inference. Our approach reveals reliability characteristics from multiple perspectives, highlighting the effects of model architecture, parameter scale, and task complexity.

We study whether expert detection can be treated as a learnable skill and improved through structured calibration. We introduce LREAD, a rubric derived from national Korean writing standards and adapted to target micro-level artifacts (e.g., punctuation optionality, spacing behavior, and register shifts). In a three-phase longitudinal blind protocol with Korean linguistics majors, Phase 1 measures intuition-only detection, Phase 2 enforces criterion-level scoring with explicit justifications, and Phase 3 evaluates domain-focused mastery on held-out elementary essays. Across phases, majority-vote accuracy increases from 60% to 100%, accompanied by stronger inter-annotator agreement (Fleiss' kappa: -0.09 --> 0.82). Compared to state-of-the-art LLM detectors, calibrated humans rely more on language-specific micro-diagnostics that are not well captured by coarse discourse priors. Our findings suggest that rubric-scaffolded expert judgment can serve as an interpretable complement to automated detectors for non-English settings, and we release the full rubric and a taxonomy of calibrated detection signatures.",

        "abstract": "Synthetic data has proven itself to be a valuable resource for tuning smaller, cost-effective language models to handle the complexities of multi-turn tool calling conversations. While many frameworks and systems for producing synthetic multi-turn tool calling data have been proposed, prior works have frequently assumed that any tool calling interactions will take place in an execution environment that maintains state. When such an environment is available, this is advantageous as it allows for the validity of an interaction to be determined by whether or not the state of the execution environment matches to some prespecified objective. Unfortunately, this does not hold in many real-world tool use settings, e.g., in enterprise settings where data security is of the utmost importance or in cases where tool specifications are synthesized from multiple sources. In this work, we address this gap by introducing a data generation method, DiGiT-TC, that is designed to produce tool calling conversations that have the characteristics of conversations generated through search in a stateful environment. The key to our technique lies in a novel generation pattern that allows our approach to implicitly represent certain tool calls in the user request. We validate our approach on standard tool calling benchmarks and demonstrate that, even in stateful problem settings, our approach results in strong performance gains.",

To mitigate this issue, we propose adaptive self-knowledge distillation (ASKD), which dynamically reduces the dependence of the teacher model to improve the self-training capacity, and performs the self-knowledge distillation method to improve the generalization capacity of the student model. We further distill the Whisper model into a smaller variant, called FastWhisper. In our post-training setting, FastWhisper achieved a word error rate of 1.07% lower than the teacher model Whisper, and its relative inference time was 5 times faster.",

Studies show that, under homogeneous agents and uniform belief updates, debate preserves expected correctness and therefore cannot reliably improve outcomes. Drawing on findings from human deliberation and collective decision-making, we identify two key mechanisms missing from vanilla MAD: (i) diversity of initial viewpoints and (ii) explicit, calibrated confidence communication. We propose two lightweight interventions. First, a diversity-aware initialisation that selects a more diverse pool of candidate answers, increasing the likelihood that a correct hypothesis is present at the start of debate. Second, a confidence-modulated debate protocol in which agents express calibrated confidence and condition their updates on others' confidence. We show theoretically that diversity-aware initialisation improves the prior probability of MAD success without changing the underlying update dynamics, while confidence-modulated updates enable debate to systematically drift to the correct hypothesis. Empirically, across six reasoning-oriented QA benchmarks, our methods consistently outperform vanilla MAD and majority vote. Our results connect human deliberation with LLM-based debate and demonstrate that simple, principled modifications can substantially enhance debate effectiveness.",

Despite rapid progress in language models, we still lack a clear way to understand how their abilities in these interpersonal domains compare to those of humans. We introduce HEART, the first-ever framework that directly compares humans and LLMs on the same multi-turn emotional-support conversations. For each dialogue history, we pair human and model responses and evaluate them through blinded human raters and an ensemble of LLM-as-judge evaluators. All assessments follow a rubric grounded in interpersonal communication science across five dimensions: Human Alignment, Empathic Responsiveness, Attunement, Resonance, and Task-Following. HEART uncovers striking behavioral patterns. Several frontier models approach or surpass the average human responses in perceived empathy and consistency. At the same time, humans maintain advantages in adaptive reframing, tension-naming, and nuanced tone shifts, particularly in adversarial turns. Human and LLM-as-judge preferences align on about 80 percent of pairwise comparisons, matching inter-human agreement, and their written rationales emphasize similar HEART dimensions. This pattern suggests an emerging convergence in the criteria used to assess supportive quality. By placing humans and models on equal footing, HEART reframes supportive dialogue as a distinct capability axis, separable from general reasoning or linguistic fluency. It provides a unified empirical foundation for understanding where model-generated support aligns with human social judgment, where it diverges, and how affective conversational competence scales with model size.",

However, current evaluations lack effective methodologies to measure this structural fidelity without costly human intervention, as traditional text metrics fail to detect semantic drift in code-like outputs. This paper proposes Table-BiEval, a novel approach based on a human-free, self-supervised evaluation framework, to assess LLMs performance quantitatively. By leveraging deterministic Intermediate Representations, our framework calculates Content Semantic Accuracy and Normalized Tree Edit Distance to decouple structure from content. Also, it empirically evaluates 15 state-of-the-art LLMs across dual topological dimensions-hierarchical structures and flat tables. The results reveal substantial variability, highlighting that mid-sized models can surprisingly outperform larger counterparts in structural efficiency and confirming that deep recursive nesting remains a universal bottleneck for current architectures.",

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive progress in optimization modeling, fostering a rapid expansion of new methodologies and evaluation benchmarks. However, the boundaries of their capabilities in automated formulation and problem solving remain poorly understood, particularly when extending to complex, real-world tasks. To bridge this gap, we propose OPT-ENGINE, an extensible benchmark framework designed to evaluate LLMs on optimization modeling with controllable and scalable difficulty levels. OPT-ENGINE spans 10 canonical tasks across operations research, with five Linear Programming and five Mixed-Integer Programming. Utilizing OPT-ENGINE, we conduct an extensive study of LLMs' reasoning capabilities, addressing two critical questions: 1.) Do LLMs' performance remain robust when generalizing to out-of-distribution optimization tasks that scale in complexity beyond current benchmark levels? and 2.) At what stage, from problem interpretation to solution generation, do current LLMs encounter the most significant bottlenecks? Our empirical results yield two key insights: first, tool-integrated reasoning with external solvers exhibits significantly higher robustness as task complexity escalates, while pure-text reasoning reaches a ceiling; second, the automated formulation of constraints constitutes the primary performance bottleneck. These findings provide actionable guidance for developing next-generation LLMs for advanced optimization. Our code is publicly available at \\textcolor{blue}{this https URL}.",

To explore LLM's potential in assisting scientific review, this study examined ChatGPT-5, Gemini-3-Pro, and Claude-Sonnet-4.5's consistency and reliability in evaluating abstracts compared to one another and to human reviewers. Methods: 160 abstracts from a local conference were graded by human reviewers and three LLMs using one rubric. Composite score distributions across three LLMs and fourteen reviewers were examined. Inter-rater reliability was calculated using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) for within-AI reliability and AI-human concordance. Bland-Altman plots were examined for visual agreement patterns and systematic bias. Results: LLMs achieved good-to-excellent agreement with each other (ICCs: 0.59-0.87). ChatGPT and Claude reached moderate agreement with human reviewers on overall quality and content-specific criteria, with ICCs ~.45-.60 for composite, impression, clarity, objective, and results. They exhibited fair agreement on subjective dimensions, with ICC ranging from 0.23-0.38 for impact, engagement, and applicability. Gemini showed fair agreement on half criteria and no reliability on impact and applicability. Three LLMs showed acceptable or negligible mean difference (ChatGPT=0.24, Gemini=0.42, Claude=-0.02) from the human mean composite scores. Discussion: LLMs could process abstracts in batches with moderate agreement with human experts on overall quality and objective criteria. With appropriate process architecture, they can apply a rubric consistently across volumes of abstracts exceeding feasibility for a human rater. The weaker performance on subjective dimensions indicates that AI should serve a complementary role in evaluation, while human expertise remains essential.",

While the foundational architecture establishes state spaces and operators for ambiguity-preserving computation, the critical question of how natural language maps to these mathematical structures remains open. This paper introduces the text-to-state mapping function {\\phi} that transforms linguistic input into superposition states within the NRR framework. We formalize the Contradiction-Preservation Principle, which requires that genuinely ambiguous expressions maintain non-zero entropy in their state representations, and develop extraction protocols using existing Large Language Models as interpretation generators. Empirical validation across 68 test sentences spanning lexical, structural, and pragmatic ambiguity demonstrates that our mapping achieves mean Shannon entropy H(S) = 1.087 bits for ambiguous inputs while baseline single-interpretation approaches yield H(S) = 0.000. The framework provides the missing algorithmic bridge between raw text and the formal state spaces on which NRR operators act, enabling architectural collapse deferment in language model inference.",

In practice, identical prompts do not always produce identical outputs, even when temperature and other decoding parameters are fixed. In this work, we conduct repeated-run experiments to empirically quantify baseline behavioural drift, defined as output variability observed when the same prompt is issued multiple times under operator-free conditions. We evaluate two publicly accessible models, gpt-4o-mini and llama3.1-8b, across five prompt categories using exact repeats, perturbed inputs, and reuse modes at temperatures of 0.0 and 0.7. Drift is measured using unique output fractions, lexical similarity, and word count statistics, enabling direct comparison across models, prompting modes, and deployment types. The results show that nondeterminism persists even at temperature 0.0, with distinct variability patterns by model size, deployment, and prompt type. We situate these findings within existing work on concept drift, behavioural drift, and infrastructure-induced nondeterminism, discuss the limitations of lexical metrics, and highlight emerging semantic approaches. By establishing a systematic empirical baseline in the absence of stabilisation techniques, this study provides a reference point for evaluating future drift mitigation and control methods.",

To address this gap, we introduce \\textsc{Mem2ActBench}, a benchmark for evaluating whether agents can proactively leverage long-term memory to execute tool-based actions by selecting appropriate tools and grounding their parameters. The benchmark simulates persistent assistant usage, where users mention the same topic across long, interrupted interactions and expect previously established preferences and task states to be implicitly applied. We build the dataset with an automated pipeline that merges heterogeneous sources (ToolACE, BFCL, Oasst1), resolves conflicts via consistency modeling, and synthesizes 2,029 sessions with 12 user--assistant--tool turns on average. From these memory chains, a reverse-generation method produces 400 tool-use tasks, with human evaluation confirming 91.3\\% are strongly memory-dependent.

In this work, we propose Gap-K%, a novel pretraining data detection method grounded in the optimization dynamics of LLM pretraining. By analyzing the next-token prediction objective, we observe that discrepancies between the model's top-1 prediction and the target token induce strong gradient signals, which are explicitly penalized during training. Motivated by this, Gap-K% leverages the log probability gap between the top-1 predicted token and the target token, incorporating a sliding window strategy to capture local correlations and mitigate token-level fluctuations. Extensive experiments on the WikiMIA and MIMIR benchmarks demonstrate that Gap-K% achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently outperforming prior baselines across various model sizes and input lengths.",

However, variations in individual experiences and different levels of device interactions lead to data and model initialization heterogeneities across devices. Such heterogeneities leave variations in local model parameters across devices that leads to slower convergence. This paper tackles the data and model heterogeneity by explicitly addressing the parameter level varying evidential credence across local models. A novel aggregation approach is introduced that captures these parameter variations in local models and performs robust aggregation of neighbourhood local updates. Specifically, consensus weights are generated via approximation of second-order information of local models on their local datasets. These weights are utilized to scale neighbourhood updates before aggregating them into global neighbourhood representation. In extensive experiments with computer vision tasks, the proposed approach shows strong generalizability of local models at reduced communication costs.",

In these architectures, each neuron is mapped to a dedicated hardware unit, making them well-suited for field-programmable gate array (FPGA) implementation. Previous unrolled implementations mostly focus on fully connected networks because of their simplicity, although it is well known that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) require fewer computations for the same accuracy. When observing the data flow in CNNs, pooling layers and convolutional layers with a stride larger than one, the number of data at their output is reduced with respect to their input. This data reduction strongly affects the data rate in a fully parallel implementation, making hardware units heavily underutilized unless it is handled properly. This work addresses this issue by analyzing the data flow of CNNs and presents a novel approach to designing data-rate-aware, continuous-flow CNN architectures. The proposed approach ensures a high hardware utilization close to 100% by interleaving low data rate signals and sharing hardware units, as well as using the right parallelization to achieve the throughput of a fully parallel implementation. The results show that a significant amount of the arithmetic logic can be saved, which allows implementing complex CNNs like MobileNet on a single FPGA with high throughput.",

This growing trend highlights the need for a comprehensive benchmarking and evaluation framework dedicated to LLM-based HLS. To address this, We present Bench4HLS for evaluating LLM-generated HLS designs. Bench4HLS comprises 170 manually drafted and validated case studies, spanning small kernels to complex accelerators, curated from widely used public repositories. The framework supports fully automated assessment of compilation success, functional correctness via simulation, and synthesis feasibility/optimization. Crucially, Bench4HLS integrates a pluggable API for power, performance, and area (PPA) analysis across various HLS toolchains and architectures, demonstrated here with Xilinx Vitis HLS and validated on Catapult HLS. By providing a structured, extensible, and plug-and-play testbed, Bench4HLS establishes a foundational methodology for benchmarking LLMs in HLS workflows.",

For evaluation, we utilize three different metrics (WER, CER, BLEU) and provide an outlook on qualitative semantic analysis. The results demonstrate significant performance differences between the models: while the best systems already achieve very good Word Error Rates (WER) of partly below 3%, the error rates of other models, especially concerning medical terminology or dialect-influenced variations, are considerably higher.",

        "abstract": "Real-time voice agents face a dilemma: end-to-end models often lack deep reasoning, while cascaded pipelines incur high latency by executing ASR, LLM reasoning, and TTS strictly in sequence, unlike human conversation where listeners often start thinking before the speaker finishes. Since cascaded architectures remain the dominant choice for complex tasks, existing cascaded streaming strategies attempt to reduce this latency via mechanical segmentation (e.g., fixed chunks, VAD-based splitting) or speculative generation, but they frequently either break semantic units or waste computation on predictions that must be rolled back. To address these challenges, we propose LTS-VoiceAgent, a Listen-Think-Speak framework that explicitly separates when to think from how to reason incrementally. It features a Dynamic Semantic Trigger to detect meaningful prefixes, and a Dual-Role Stream Orchestrator that coordinates a background Thinker (for state maintenance) and a foreground Speaker (for speculative solving). This parallel design enables \"thinking while speaking\" without blocking responses. We also introduce a Pause-and-Repair benchmark containing natural disfluencies to stress-test streaming robustness. Experiments across VERA, Spoken-MQA, BigBenchAudio, and our benchmark show that LTS-VoiceAgent achieves a stronger accuracy-latency-efficiency trade-off than serial cascaded baselines and existing streaming strategies.",

The paradigm takes inspiration from the autonomous nervous system and employs a probabilistic neuron (p-neuron) driven by an analog feature extraction circuit.

        "abstract": "As Speech Language Models (SLMs) transition from personal devices to shared, multi-user environments such as smart homes, a new challenge emerges: the model is expected to distinguish between users to manage information flow appropriately. Without this capability, an SLM could reveal one user's confidential schedule to another, a privacy failure we term interactional privacy. Thus, the ability to generate speaker-aware responses becomes essential for SLM safe deployment. Current SLM benchmarks test dialogue ability but overlook speaker identity. Multi-speaker benchmarks check who said what without assessing whether SLMs adapt their responses. Privacy benchmarks focus on globally sensitive data (e.g., bank passwords) while neglecting contextual privacy-sensitive information (e.g., a user's private appointment). To address this gap, we introduce VoxPrivacy, the first benchmark designed to evaluate interactional privacy in SLMs. VoxPrivacy spans three tiers of increasing difficulty, from following direct secrecy commands to proactively protecting privacy. Our evaluation of nine SLMs on a 32-hour bilingual dataset reveals a widespread vulnerability: most open-source models perform close to random chance (around 50% accuracy) on conditional privacy decisions, while even strong closed-source systems fall short on proactive privacy inference. We further validate these findings on Real-VoxPrivacy, a human-recorded subset, confirming that failures observed on synthetic data persist in real speech. Finally, we demonstrate a viable path forward: by fine-tuning on a new 4,000-hour training set, we improve privacy-preserving abilities while maintaining robustness. To support future work, we release the VoxPrivacy benchmark, the large-scale training set, and the fine-tuned model to foster the development of safer and more context-aware SLMs.",

We argue that the high computational requirements and latency issues associated with these models do not align well with streaming applications. Our study promotes the search for alternative strategies to improve efficiency without sacrificing performance.  In light of this observation, our paper critically examines the usefulness of transformer architecture in such constrained environments. As a first attempt, we show that the computational cost for Streaming Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) can be reduced using deformable convolution instead of Self-Attention.

This issue is further exacerbated in practice, as retraining or adapting decoders becomes particularly challenging when only limited data are available from a new session. To address this challenge, we propose a Task-Conditioned Latent Alignment framework (TCLA) for cross-session neural decoding. Building upon an autoencoder architecture, TCLA first learns a low-dimensional representation of neural dynamics from a source session with sufficient data. For target sessions with limited data, TCLA then aligns target latent representations to the source in a task-conditioned manner, enabling effective transfer of learned neural dynamics. We evaluate TCLA on the macaque motor and oculomotor center-out dataset. Compared to baseline methods trained solely on target-session data, TCLA consistently improves decoding performance across datasets and decoding settings, with gains in the coefficient of determination of up to 0.386 for y coordinate velocity decoding in a motor dataset. These results suggest that TCLA provides an effective strategy for transferring knowledge from source to target sessions, enabling more robust neural decoding under conditions with limited data.",

To mitigate this issue, unlearnable examples introduce imperceptible perturbations into data, preventing models from learning effectively. However, existing methods typically rely on deep neural networks as surrogate models for perturbation generation, resulting in significant computational costs. In this work, we propose Perturbation-Induced Linearization (PIL), a computationally efficient yet effective method that generates perturbations using only linear surrogate models. PIL achieves comparable or better performance than existing surrogate-based methods while reducing computational time dramatically. We further reveal a key mechanism underlying unlearnable examples: inducing linearization to deep models, which explains why PIL can achieve competitive results in a very short time. Beyond this, we provide an analysis about the property of unlearnable examples under percentage-based partial perturbation. Our work not only provides a practical approach for data protection but also offers insights into what makes unlearnable examples effective.",

We identify and characterize two key failure modes: the multilingual transfer bottleneck (correct language, incorrect task response) and the language consistency bottleneck (correct task response, wrong language). To systematically surface these issues, we design a four-scenario evaluation protocol spanning MMLU, MGSM, and XQuAD benchmarks. To probe these issues with interpretability, we extend logit lens analysis to track language probabilities layer by layer and compute cross-lingual semantic similarity of hidden states. The results reveal a three-phase internal structure: early layers align inputs into a shared semantic space, middle layers perform task reasoning, and late layers drive language-specific generation. Guided by these insights, we introduce selective fine-tuning of only the final layers responsible for language control. On Qwen-3-32B and Bloom-7.1B, this method achieves over 98 percent language consistency across six languages while fine-tuning only 3-5 percent of parameters, without sacrificing task accuracy. Importantly, this result is nearly identical to that of full-scope fine-tuning (for example, above 98 percent language consistency for both methods across all prompt scenarios) but uses a fraction of the computational resources. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to leverage layer-localization of language control for efficient multilingual adaptation.",

StructuralCFN explicitly models each feature as a mathematical composition of its counterparts through Differentiable Adaptive Gating, which automatically discovers the optimal activation physics (e.g., attention-style filtering vs. inhibitory polarity) for each relationship. Our framework enables Structured Knowledge Integration, allowing domain-specific relational priors to be injected directly into the architecture to guide discovery. We evaluate StructuralCFN across a rigorous 10-fold cross-validation suite on 18 benchmarks, demonstrating statistically significant improvements (p < 0.05) on scientific and clinical datasets (e.g., Blood Transfusion, Ozone, WDBC). Furthermore, StructuralCFN provides Intrinsic Symbolic Interpretability: it recovers the governing \"laws\" of the data manifold as human-readable mathematical expressions while maintaining a compact parameter footprint (300--2,500 parameters) that is over an order of magnitude (10x--20x) smaller than standard deep baselines.",

However, deploying RAG on edge devices faces efficiency hurdles due to the rapid growth of profile data, such as user-LLM interactions and recent updates. While Computing-in-Memory (CiM) architectures mitigate this bottleneck by eliminating data movement between memory and processing units via in-situ operations, they are susceptible to environmental noise that can degrade retrieval precision. This poses a critical issue in dynamic, multi-domain edge-based scenarios (e.g., travel, medicine, and law) where both accuracy and adaptability are paramount. To address these challenges, we propose Task-Oriented Noise-resilient Embedding Learning (TONEL), a framework that improves noise robustness and domain adaptability for RAG in noisy edge environments. TONEL employs a noise-aware projection model to learn task-specific embeddings compatible with CiM hardware constraints, enabling accurate retrieval under noisy conditions. Extensive experiments conducted on personalization benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of our methods relative to strong baselines, especially in task-specific noisy scenarios.",

We present a neurosymbolic framework that combines LLMs with SMT solvers to produce verification-guided answers through iterative refinement. Our approach decomposes LLM outputs into atomic claims, autoformalizes them into first-order logic, and verifies their logical consistency using automated theorem proving. We introduce three key innovations: (1) multi-model consensus via formal semantic equivalence checking to ensure logic-level alignment between candidates, eliminating the syntactic bias of surface-form metrics, (2) semantic routing that directs different claim types to appropriate verification strategies: symbolic solvers for logical claims and LLM ensembles for commonsense reasoning, and (3) precise logical error localization via Minimal Correction Subsets (MCS), which pinpoint the exact subset of claims to revise, transforming binary failure signals into actionable feedback. Our framework classifies claims by their logical status and aggregates multiple verification signals into a unified score with variance-based penalty. The system iteratively refines answers using structured feedback until acceptance criteria are met or convergence is achieved. This hybrid approach delivers formal guarantees where possible and consensus verification elsewhere, advancing trustworthy AI. With the GPT-OSS-120B model, VERGE demonstrates an average performance uplift of 18.7% at convergence across a set of reasoning benchmarks compared to single-pass approaches.",

Through systematic experiments, we demonstrate that sequence modeling in recommendation systems follows predictable power-law scaling similar to LLMs. Crucially, we find that semantic features bend the scaling curve: they are a prerequisite for scaling, enabling the model to effectively utilize the capacity of deeper and longer architectures. To realize the benefits of continued scaling under strict latency constraints, we introduce a two-stage architecture that offloads the heavy computation of large, long-context models to an asynchronous upstream user model. We demonstrate that upstream improvements transfer predictably to downstream ranking tasks. Deployed as the largest user model at Meta, this multi-stage framework drives a 4.3\\% conversion uplift on Facebook Feed and Reels with minimal serving overhead, establishing a practical blueprint for harnessing scaling laws in industrial recommender systems.",

Such human-AI collective knowledge ecosystems contain feedback loops with both benefits (e.g., faster growth, easier learning) and systemic risks (e.g., quality dilution, skill reduction, model collapse). To understand such phenomena, we propose a minimal, interpretable dynamical model of the co-evolution of archive size, archive quality, model (LLM) skill, aggregate human skill, and query volume. The model captures two content inflows (human, LLM) controlled by a gate on LLM-content admissions, two learning pathways for humans (archive study vs. LLM assistance), and two LLM-training modalities (corpus-driven scaling vs. learning from human feedback). Through numerical experiments, we identify different growth regimes (e.g., healthy growth, inverted flow, inverted learning, oscillations), and show how platform and policy levers (gate strictness, LLM training, human learning pathways) shift the system across regime boundaries. Two domain configurations (PubMed, GitHub and Copilot) illustrate contrasting steady states under different growth rates and moderation norms. We also fit the model to Wikipedia's knowledge flow during pre-ChatGPT and post-ChatGPT eras separately. We find a rise in LLM additions with a concurrent decline in human inflow, consistent with a regime identified by the model. Our model and analysis yield actionable insights for sustainable growth of human-AI collective knowledge on the Web.",

However, the practical implications of these findings are not yet clear. In this work, we explore the impact of rehabilitative conversations with generative AI chatbots on users who share toxic content online. Toxic behaviors -- like insults or threats of violence, are widespread in online communities. Strategies to deal with toxic behavior are typically punitive, such as removing content or banning users. Rehabilitative approaches are rarely attempted, in part due to the emotional and psychological cost of engaging with aggressive users. In collaboration with seven large Reddit communities, we conducted a large-scale field experiment (N=893) to invite people who had recently posted toxic content to participate in conversations with AI chatbots. A qualitative analysis of the conversations shows that many participants engaged in good faith and even expressed remorse or a desire to change. However, we did not observe a significant change in toxic behavior in the following month compared to a control group. We discuss possible explanations for our findings, as well as theoretical and practical implications based on our results.",

As LLMs increasingly serve as evaluators in code-based RL, their ability to detect reward hacking remains understudied. In this paper, we propose a novel taxonomy of reward exploits spanning across 54 categories and introduce TRACE (Testing Reward Anomalies in Code Environments), a synthetically curated and human-verified benchmark containing 517 testing trajectories. Unlike prior work that evaluates reward hack detection in isolated classification scenarios, we contrast these evaluations with a more realistic, contrastive anomaly detection setup on TRACE. Our experiments reveal that models capture reward hacks more effectively in contrastive settings than in isolated classification settings, with GPT-5.2 with highest reasoning mode achieving the best detection rate at 63%, up from 45% in isolated settings on TRACE. Building on this insight, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art models struggle significantly more with semantically contextualized reward hacks compared to syntactically contextualized ones. We further conduct qualitative analyses of model behaviors, as well as ablation studies showing that the ratio of benign to hacked trajectories and analysis cluster sizes substantially impact detection performance.

As GPUs continue improving to satisfy ever-increasing performance demands, analyzing past and current progress becomes paramount in determining future constraints on scientific research. This is particularly compelling in the AI domain, where rapid technological advancements and fierce global competition have led the United States to recently implement export control regulations limiting international access to advanced AI chips. For this reason, this paper studies technical progress in NVIDIA datacenter GPUs released from the mid-2000s until today. Specifically, we compile a comprehensive dataset of datacenter NVIDIA GPUs comprising several features, ranging from computational performance to release price. Then, we examine trends in main GPU features and estimate progress indicators for per-memory bandwidth, per-dollar, and per-watt increase rates. Our main results identify doubling times of 1.44 and 1.69 years for FP16 and FP32 operations (without accounting for sparsity benefits), while FP64 doubling times range from 2.06 to 3.79 years. Off-chip memory size and bandwidth grew at slower rates than computing performance, doubling every 3.32 to 3.53 years. The release prices of datacenter GPUs have roughly doubled every 5.1 years, while their power consumption has approximately doubled every 16 years. Finally, we quantify the potential implications of current U.S. export control regulations in terms of the potential performance gaps that would result if implementation were assumed to be complete and successful. We find that recently proposed changes to export controls would shrink the potential performance gap from 23.6x to 3.54x.",

This paper presents the first systematic investigation of MIA vulnerabilities in DLMs. Unlike the autoregressive models' single fixed prediction pattern, DLMs' multiple maskable configurations exponentially increase attack opportunities. This ability to probe many independent masks dramatically improves detection chances. To exploit this, we introduce SAMA (Subset-Aggregated Membership Attack), which addresses the sparse signal challenge through robust aggregation. SAMA samples masked subsets across progressive densities and applies sign-based statistics that remain effective despite heavy-tailed noise. Through inverse-weighted aggregation prioritizing sparse masks' cleaner signals, SAMA transforms sparse memorization detection into a robust voting mechanism. Experiments on nine datasets show SAMA achieves 30% relative AUC improvement over the best baseline, with up to 8 times improvement at low false positive rates. These findings reveal significant, previously unknown vulnerabilities in DLMs, necessitating the development of tailored privacy defenses.",

This work investigates Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) as a training paradigm that explicitly rewards abstention (\"I don't know\") alongside correctness to promote intellectual humility. We fine-tune and evaluate Granite-3.3-2B-Instruct and Qwen-3-4B-Instruct on the MedMCQA and Hendrycks Math benchmarks using a ternary reward structure ($-1$, r_abs, 1) under varying abstention reward structures. We further study the effect of combining RLVR with supervised fine-tuning strategies that teach abstention prior to reinforcement learning. Our results show that moderate abstention rewards (r_abs $\\approx -0.25$ to 0.3) consistently reduce incorrect responses without severe accuracy degradation on multiple-choice tasks, with larger models exhibiting greater robustness to abstention incentives. On open-ended question answering, we observe limitations due to insufficient exploration, which can be partially mitigated through supervised abstention training. Overall, these findings demonstrate the feasibility and flexibility of verifiable reward design as a practical approach for hallucination mitigation in language models.

However, progress remains constrained by the scarcity of large-scale and diverse annotated datasets. Although several Bengali sentiment and hate speech datasets are publicly available, most are limited in size or confined to a single domain, such as social media comments. Consequently, these resources are often insufficient for training modern deep learning based models, which require large volumes of heterogeneous data to learn robust and generalizable representations. In this work, we introduce BengaliSent140, a large-scale Bengali binary sentiment dataset constructed by consolidating seven existing Bengali text datasets into a unified corpus. To ensure consistency across sources, heterogeneous annotation schemes are systematically harmonized into a binary sentiment formulation with two classes: Not Hate (0) and Hate (1). The resulting dataset comprises 139,792 unique text samples, including 68,548 hate and 71,244 not-hate instances, yielding a relatively balanced class distribution. By integrating data from multiple sources and domains, BengaliSent140 offers broader linguistic and contextual coverage than existing Bengali sentiment datasets and provides a strong foundation for training and benchmarking deep learning models. Baseline experimental results are also reported to demonstrate the practical usability of the dataset. The dataset is publicly available at this https URL",

Finally, we address the Robustness Layer by identifying architectural mitigations for domain generalization failures, lexical blind spots, and the silent degradation of retrieval quality due to temporal drift. By categorizing these limitations and design choices, we provide a comprehensive framework for practitioners to optimize the efficiency-effectiveness frontier in modern neural search systems.",

LLMs, particularly Claude, accurately capture public perceptions of others' willingness to contribute financially to climate action (MAE approximately 5 p.p.; r = .77), comparable to statistical models, though performance declines in less digitally connected, lower-GDP countries. Controlled tests show that LLMs capture the key psychological process - social projection with a systematic downward bias - and rely on structured reasoning rather than memorized values. Overall, LLMs provide a rapid tool for assessing perception gaps in climate action, serving as an alternative to costly surveys in resource-rich countries and as a complement in underrepresented populations.",

We propose much simpler techniques for assessing implicit planning in language models. With case studies on rhyme poetry generation and question answering, we demonstrate that our methodology easily scales to many models. Across models, we find that the generated rhyme (e.g. \"-ight\") or answer to a question (\"whale\") can be manipulated by steering at the end of the preceding line with a vector, affecting the generation of intermediate tokens leading up to the rhyme or answer word. We show that implicit planning is a universal mechanism, present in smaller models than previously thought, starting from 1B parameters. Our methodology offers a widely applicable direct way to study implicit planning abilities of LLMs. More broadly, understanding planning abilities of language models can inform decisions in AI safety and control.",

Nonetheless, to extract connective structures, existing techniques aggregate discretized system matrices into graphs, and suffer from rank inflation and a suboptimal convergence rate. In this paper, we articulate NeuraLSP, a novel neural preconditioner combined with a novel loss metric that leverages the left singular subspace of the system matrix's near-nullspace vectors. By compressing spectral information into a fixed low-rank operator, our method exhibits both theoretical guarantees and empirical robustness to rank inflation, affording up to a 53% speedup. Besides the theoretical guarantees for our newly-formulated loss function, our comprehensive experimental results across diverse families of PDEs also substantiate the aforementioned theoretical advances.",

        "abstract": "Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization remains a fundamental challenge in real-world classification, where test distributions often differ substantially from training data. Most existing approaches pursue domain-invariant representations, implicitly assuming that invariance implies reliability. However, features that are invariant across domains are not necessarily causally effective for prediction. In this work, we revisit OOD classification from a causal perspective and propose to evaluate learned representations based on their necessity and sufficiency under distribution shift. We introduce an explicit segment-level framework that directly measures causal effectiveness across domains, providing a more faithful criterion than invariance alone. Experiments on multi-domain benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in OOD performance, particularly under challenging domain shifts, highlighting the value of causal evaluation for robust generalization.",

        "abstract": "Robust reinforcement learning methods typically focus on suppressing unreliable experiences or corrupted rewards, but they lack the ability to reason about the reliability of their own learning process. As a result, such methods often either overreact to noise by becoming overly conservative or fail catastrophically when uncertainty accumulates. In this work, we propose a meta-cognitive reinforcement learning framework that enables an agent to assess, regulate, and recover its learning behavior based on internally estimated reliability signals. The proposed method introduces a meta-trust variable driven by Value Prediction Error Stability (VPES), which modulates learning dynamics via fail-safe regulation and gradual trust recovery. Experiments on continuous-control benchmarks with reward corruption demonstrate that recovery-enabled meta-cognitive control achieves higher average returns and significantly reduces late-stage training failures compared to strong robustness baselines.",

        "abstract": "Inferring physical fields from sparse observations while strictly satisfying partial differential equations (PDEs) is a fundamental challenge in computational physics. Recently, deep generative models offer powerful data-driven priors for such inverse problems, yet existing methods struggle to enforce hard physical constraints without costly retraining or disrupting the learned generative prior. Consequently, there is a critical need for a sampling mechanism that can reconcile strict physical consistency and observational fidelity with the statistical structure of the pre-trained prior. To this end, we present ProFlow, a proximal guidance framework for zero-shot physics-consistent sampling, defined as inferring solutions from sparse observations using a fixed generative prior without task-specific retraining. The algorithm employs a rigorous two-step scheme that alternates between: (\\romannumeral1) a terminal optimization step, which projects the flow prediction onto the intersection of the physically and observationally consistent sets via proximal minimization; and (\\romannumeral2) an interpolation step, which maps the refined state back to the generative trajectory to maintain consistency with the learned flow probability path. This procedure admits a Bayesian interpretation as a sequence of local maximum a posteriori (MAP) updates. Comprehensive benchmarks on Poisson, Helmholtz, Darcy, and viscous Burgers' equations demonstrate that ProFlow achieves superior physical and observational consistency, as well as more accurate distributional statistics, compared to state-of-the-art diffusion- and flow-based baselines.",

        "abstract": "The scaling law, which indicates that model performance improves with increasing dataset and model capacity, has fueled a growing trend in expanding recommendation models in both industry and academia. However, the advent of large-scale recommenders also brings significantly higher computational costs, particularly under the long-sequence dependencies inherent in the user intent of recommendation systems. Current approaches often rely on pre-storing the intermediate states of the past behavior for each user, thereby reducing the quadratic re-computation cost for the following requests. Despite their effectiveness, these methods often treat memory merely as a medium for acceleration, without adequately considering the space overhead it introduces. This presents a critical challenge in real-world recommendation systems with billions of users, each of whom might initiate thousands of interactions and require massive memory for state storage. Fortunately, there have been several memory management strategies examined for compression in LLM, while most have not been evaluated on the recommendation task. To mitigate this gap, we introduce MALLOC, a comprehensive benchmark for memory-aware long sequence compression. MALLOC presents a comprehensive investigation and systematic classification of memory management techniques applicable to large sequential recommendations. These techniques are integrated into state-of-the-art recommenders, enabling a reproducible and accessible evaluation platform. Through extensive experiments across accuracy, efficiency, and complexity, we demonstrate the holistic reliability of MALLOC in advancing large-scale recommendation.

Novice workers who rely heavily on AI to complete unfamiliar tasks may compromise their own skill acquisition in the process. We conduct randomized experiments to study how developers gained mastery of a new asynchronous programming library with and without the assistance of AI. We find that AI use impairs conceptual understanding, code reading, and debugging abilities, without delivering significant efficiency gains on average. Participants who fully delegated coding tasks showed some productivity improvements, but at the cost of learning the library. We identify six distinct AI interaction patterns, three of which involve cognitive engagement and preserve learning outcomes even when participants receive AI assistance. Our findings suggest that AI-enhanced productivity is not a shortcut to competence and AI assistance should be carefully adopted into workflows to preserve skill formation -- particularly in safety-critical domains.",

In this paper, we study rectified flow models, which constrain transport trajectories to be linear from the base distribution to the data distribution. This structural restriction greatly accelerates sampling, often enabling high-quality generation with a single Euler step. Under standard assumptions on the neural network classes used to parameterize the velocity field and data distribution, we prove that rectified flows achieve sample complexity $\\tilde{O}(\\varepsilon^{-2})$. This improves on the best known $O(\\varepsilon^{-4})$ bounds for flow matching model and matches the optimal rate for mean estimation. Our analysis exploits the particular structure of rectified flows: because the model is trained with a squared loss along linear paths, the associated hypothesis class admits a sharply controlled localized Rademacher complexity. This yields the improved, order-optimal sample complexity and provides a theoretical explanation for the strong empirical performance of rectified flow models.",

This challenge is especially acute in practice-based domains, where knowledge is procedural and grounded in professional judgment, while most existing LLM benchmarks depend on pre-existing human exam datasets that are often unavailable in such settings. We introduce a framework for automated benchmark generation from expert-authored guidelines informed by Bloom's Taxonomy. It converts expert practices into implicit violation-based scenarios and expands them into auto-graded multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and multi-turn dialogues across four cognitive levels, enabling deterministic, reproducible, and scalable evaluation. Applied to three applied domains: teaching, dietetics, and caregiving, we find differences between model and human-like reasoning: LLMs sometimes perform relatively better on higher-order reasoning (Analyze) but fail more frequently on lower-level items (Remember). We produce large-scale, psychometrically informed benchmarks that surface these non-intuitive model behaviors and enable evaluation of contextualized reasoning in real-world settings.",

When temporal ordering information is corrupted, missing, or deliberately hidden (e.g., for privacy), existing estimation methods often fail. In this paper, we investigate the conditions under which temporal order can be recovered and introduce a novel framework that simultaneously reconstructs temporal information and estimates SDE parameters. Our approach exploits asymmetries between forward and backward processes, deriving a score-matching criterion to infer the correct temporal order between pairs of observations. We then recover the total order via a sorting procedure and estimate SDE parameters from the reconstructed sequence using maximum likelihood. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, extending parameter estimation to settings with missing temporal order and broadening applicability in sensitive domains.",

We evaluate our framework using three URL datasets and four state-of-the-art LLMs, comparing against a one-shot approach and a supervised model. We demonstrate that our framework outperforms the one-shot baseline while achieving performance comparable to that of the supervised model, despite requiring significantly less training data. Furthermore, our in-depth analysis highlights how the iterative reasoning enabled by Least-to-Most, and reinforced by our answer sensitivity mechanism, drives these performance gains. Overall, we show that this simple yet powerful prompting strategy consistently outperforms both one-shot and supervised approaches, despite requiring minimal training or few-shot guidance.

We introduce EverMemBench-S (EMB-S), an adversarial NIAH-style benchmark built on a 326M-token MemoryBank. While the full MemoryBank spans 326M tokens for retrieval-based (RAG) evaluation, we evaluate native long-context models only at scales that fit within each model's context window (up to 1M tokens in this work) to ensure a fair comparison. EMB-S pairs queries with collision-tested near-miss hard negatives and gold evidence sets spanning one or more documents, validated via human screening and LLM verification. We also propose a decoupled diagnostic protocol that reports evidence access (document-ID localization) separately from end-to-end QA quality under full-context prompting. This enables consistent diagnosis for both native long-context prompting and retrieval pipelines. Across a reference-corpus ladder from domain-isolated 64K contexts to a globally shared 326M-token environment, we observe a clear reality gap. Systems that saturate benign NIAH degrade sharply in evidence access under semantic interference.

However, as forecasting models approach diminishing returns in accuracy, a critical yet underexplored opportunity emerges: the strategic use of post-processing. In this paper, we address the last-mile gap in time-series forecasting, which is to improve accuracy and uncertainty without retraining or modifying a deployed backbone. We propose $\\delta$-Adapter, a lightweight, architecture-agnostic way to boost deployed time series forecasters without retraining. $\\delta$-Adapter learns tiny, bounded modules at two interfaces: input nudging (soft edits to covariates) and output residual correction. We provide local descent guarantees, $O(\\delta)$ drift bounds, and compositional stability for combined adapters. Meanwhile, it can act as a feature selector by learning a sparse, horizon-aware mask over inputs to select important features, thereby improving interpretability. In addition, it can also be used as a distribution calibrator to measure uncertainty. Thus, we introduce a Quantile Calibrator and a Conformal Corrector that together deliver calibrated, personalized intervals with finite-sample coverage. Our experiments across diverse backbones and datasets show that $\\delta$-Adapter improves accuracy and calibration with negligible compute and no interface changes.",

        "abstract": "Bridging the sim2real gap between computationally inexpensive models and complex physical systems remains a central challenge in machine learning applications to engineering problems, particularly in multi-scale settings where reduced-order models typically capture only dominant dynamics. In this work, we present Cheap2Rich, a multi-scale data assimilation framework that reconstructs high-fidelity state spaces from sparse sensor histories by combining a fast low-fidelity prior with learned, interpretable discrepancy corrections. We demonstrate the performance on rotating detonation engines (RDEs), a challenging class of systems that couple detonation-front propagation with injector-driven unsteadiness, mixing, and stiff chemistry across disparate scales. Our approach successfully reconstructs high-fidelity RDE states from sparse measurements while isolating physically meaningful discrepancy dynamics associated with injector-driven effects. The results highlight a general multi-fidelity framework for data assimilation and system identification in complex multi-scale systems, enabling rapid design exploration and real-time monitoring and control while providing interpretable discrepancy dynamics.

        "abstract": "The evaluation and post-training of large language models (LLMs) rely on supervision, but strong supervision for difficult tasks is often unavailable, especially when evaluating frontier models. In such cases, models are demonstrated to exploit evaluations built on such imperfect supervision, leading to deceptive results. However, underutilized in LLM research, a wealth of mechanism design research focuses on game-theoretic incentive compatibility, i.e., eliciting honest and informative answers with weak supervision. Drawing from this literature, we introduce the peer prediction method for model evaluation and post-training. It rewards honest and informative answers over deceptive and uninformative ones, using a metric based on mutual predictability and without requiring ground truth labels. We demonstrate the method's effectiveness and resistance to deception, with both theoretical guarantees and empirical validation on models with up to 405B parameters. We show that training an 8B model with peer prediction-based reward recovers most of the drop in truthfulness due to prior malicious finetuning, even when the reward is produced by a 0.135B language model with no finetuning. On the evaluation front, in contrast to LLM-as-a-Judge which requires strong and trusted judges, we discover an inverse scaling property in peer prediction, where, surprisingly, resistance to deception is strengthened as the capability gap between the experts and participants widens, enabling reliable evaluation of strong models with weak supervision. In particular, LLM-as-a-Judge become worse than random guess when facing deceptive models 5-20x the judge's size, while peer prediction thrives when such gaps are large, including in cases with over 100x size difference.",

Consequently, mass prediction from pixels is ill-posed and therefore benefits from physically meaningful representations to constrain the space of plausible solutions. We propose a physically structured framework for single-image mass estimation that addresses this ambiguity by aligning visual cues with the physical factors governing mass. From a single RGB image, we recover object-centric three-dimensional geometry via monocular depth estimation to inform volume and extract coarse material semantics using a vision-language model to guide density-related reasoning. These geometry, semantic, and appearance representations are fused through an instance-adaptive gating mechanism, and two physically guided latent factors (volume- and density-related) are predicted through separate regression heads under mass-only supervision. Experiments on image2mass and ABO-500 show that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.",

We investigate whether general-purpose large language model (LLM) agent frameworks, originally developed for software engineering, can serve as an alternative control paradigm for embodied manipulation. We introduce FAEA (Frontier Agent as Embodied Agent), which applies an LLM agent framework directly to embodied manipulation without modification. Using the same iterative reasoning that enables software agents to debug code, FAEA enables embodied agents to reason through manipulation strategies. We evaluate an unmodified frontier agent, Claude Agent SDK, across the LIBERO, ManiSkill3, and MetaWorld benchmarks. With privileged environment state access, FAEA achieves success rates of 84.9%, 85.7%, and 96%, respectively. This level of task success approaches that of VLA models trained with less than 100 demonstrations per task, without requiring demonstrations or fine-tuning. With one round of human feedback as an optional optimization, performance increases to 88.2% on LIBERO. This demonstration-free capability has immediate practical value: FAEA can autonomously explore novel scenarios in simulation and generate successful trajectories for training data augmentation in embodied learning. Our results indicate that general-purpose agents are sufficient for a class of manipulation tasks dominated by deliberative, task-level planning. This opens a path for robotics systems to leverage actively maintained agent infrastructure and benefit directly from ongoing advances in frontier models. Code is available at this https URL",

We also provide an auto-eval framework with a reset mechanism, enabling stable and repeatable real-world benchmarking. Evaluating 12 leading GUI agents on MobileBench-OL shows significant room for improvement to meet real-world requirements. Human evaluation further confirms that MobileBench-OL can reliably measure the performance of leading GUI agents in real environments. Our data and code will be released upon acceptance.",

Proposed multimodal multiagent architecture combines information from static, dynamic and network sources. Each data type is handled by specialized agent that uses auto encoder based feature extraction. These representations are then integrated through a fusion agent. After that fused representation are used by transformer based classifier. It identifies the specific ransomware family. The agents interact through an interagent feedback mechanism that iteratively refines feature representations by suppressing low confidence information. The framework was evaluated on large scale datasets containing thousands of ransomware and benign samples. Multiple experiments were conducted on ransomware dataset. It outperforms single modality and nonadaptive fusion baseline achieving improvement of up to 0.936 in Macro-F1 for family classification and reducing calibration error. Over 100 epochs, the agentic feedback loop displays a stable monotonic convergence leading to over +0.75 absolute improvement in terms of agent quality and a final composite score of around 0.88 without fine tuning of the language models. Zeroday ransomware detection remains family dependent on polymorphism and modality disruptions.

We train flow-matching and score-based models along a Gaussian probability path and compare deterministic (ODE) sampling, stochastic (SDE) sampling, and DDPM-style discretizations derived from the same continuous-time training. Unconditionally, stochastic sampling substantially outperforms deterministic flows; score-based samplers are the most reliable among continuous-time methods, and DDPM-style ancestral sampling achieves the highest validity overall. We further show that the same models can be repurposed for guided generation: by repeatedly sampling completions under clamped clues and stopping when constraints are satisfied, the model acts as a probabilistic Sudoku solver. Although far less sample-efficient than classical solvers and discrete-geometry-aware diffusion methods, these experiments demonstrate that classic diffusion/flow formulations can assign non-zero probability mass to globally constrained combinatorial structures and can be used for constraint satisfaction via stochastic search.",

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) can be fine-tuned on domain-specific data to enhance their performance in specialized fields. However, such data often contains numerous low-quality samples, necessitating effective data processing (DP). In practice, DP strategies are typically developed through iterative manual analysis and trial-and-error adjustment. These processes inevitably incur high labor costs and may lead to privacy issues in high-privacy domains like healthcare due to direct human access to sensitive data. Thus, achieving automated data processing without exposing the raw data has become a critical challenge. To address this challenge, we propose LLM-AutoDP, a novel framework that leverages LLMs as agents to automatically generate and optimize data processing strategies. Our method generates multiple candidate strategies and iteratively refines them using feedback signals and comparative evaluations. This iterative in-context learning mechanism enables the agent to converge toward high-quality processing pipelines without requiring direct human intervention or access to the underlying data. To further accelerate strategy search, we introduce three key techniques: Distribution Preserving Sampling, which reduces data volume while maintaining distributional integrity; Processing Target Selection, which uses a binary classifier to identify low-quality samples for focused processing; Cache-and-Reuse Mechanism}, which minimizes redundant computations by reusing prior processing results. Results show that models trained on data processed by our framework achieve over 80% win rates against models trained on unprocessed data. Compared to AutoML baselines based on LLM agents, LLM-AutoDP achieves approximately a 65% win rate. Moreover, our acceleration techniques reduce the total searching time by up to 10 times, demonstrating both effectiveness and efficiency.",

As newly joined clients require significant adjustments and additional training to align with the existing system, the problem of generalizing federated learning models to unseen clients under heterogeneous data has become progressively crucial. Consequently, we highlight two unsolved challenging issues in federated domain generalization: Optimization Divergence and Performance Divergence. To tackle the above challenges, we propose FedRD, a novel heterogeneity-aware federated learning algorithm that collaboratively utilizes parameter-guided global generalization aggregation and local debiased classification to reduce divergences, aiming to obtain an optimal global model for participating and unseen clients. Extensive experiments on public multi-domain datasets demonstrate that our approach exhibits a substantial performance advantage over competing baselines in addressing this specific problem.",

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful learning tools, but they lack awareness of learners' cognitive and physiological states, limiting their adaptability to the user's learning style. Contemporary learning techniques primarily focus on structured learning paths, knowledge tracing, and generic adaptive testing but fail to address real-time learning challenges driven by cognitive load, attention fluctuations, and engagement levels. Building on findings from a formative user study (N=66), we introduce GuideAI, a multi-modal framework that enhances LLM-driven learning by integrating real-time biosensory feedback including eye gaze tracking, heart rate variability, posture detection, and digital note-taking behavior. GuideAI dynamically adapts learning content and pacing through cognitive optimizations (adjusting complexity based on learning progress markers), physiological interventions (breathing guidance and posture correction), and attention-aware strategies (redirecting focus using gaze analysis). Additionally, GuideAI supports diverse learning modalities, including text-based, image-based, audio-based, and video-based instruction, across varied knowledge domains. A preliminary study (N = 25) assessed GuideAI's impact on knowledge retention and cognitive load through standardized assessments. The results show statistically significant improvements in both problem-solving capability and recall-based knowledge assessments. Participants also experienced notable reductions in key NASA-TLX measures including mental demand, frustration levels, and effort, while simultaneously reporting enhanced perceived performance. These findings demonstrate GuideAI's potential to bridge the gap between current LLM-based learning systems and individualized learner needs, paving the way for adaptive, cognition-aware education at scale.",

Our empirical analysis reveals a counterintuitive flaw in this paradigm: while promotion rescues low-to-medium quality content, it can harm high-quality content by forcing exposure to suboptimal audiences, polluting engagement signals and downgrading future recommendation. We recast content promotion as a dual-objective optimization that balances short-term value acquisition with long-term model improvement. To make this tractable at bid time in content promotion, we introduce a decomposable surrogate objective, gradient coverage, and establish its formal connection to Fisher Information and optimal experimental design. We design a two-stage auto-bidding algorithm based on Lagrange duality that dynamically paces budget through a shadow price and optimizes impression-level bids using per-impression marginal utilities. To address missing labels at bid time, we propose a confidence-gated gradient heuristic, paired with a zeroth-order variant for black-box models that reliably estimates learning signals in real time. We provide theoretical guarantees, proving monotone submodularity of the composite objective, sublinear regret in online auction, and budget feasibility. Extensive offline experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets validate the framework: it outperforms baselines, achieves superior final AUC/LogLoss, adheres closely to budget targets, and remains effective when gradients are approximated zeroth-order. These results show that strategic, information-aware promotion can improve long-term model performance and organic outcomes beyond naive impression-maximization strategies.",

Although recent advances in neural and digital signal processing-based watermarking methods have improved imperceptibility and embedding capacity, robustness is still primarily assessed against conventional distortions such as compression, additive noise, and resampling. However, the rise of deep learning-based attacks introduces novel and significant threats to watermark security. In this work, we investigate self voice conversion as a universal, content-preserving attack against audio watermarking systems. Self voice conversion remaps a speaker's voice to the same identity while altering acoustic characteristics through a voice conversion model. We demonstrate that this attack severely degrades the reliability of state-of-the-art watermarking approaches and highlight its implications for the security of modern audio watermarking techniques.",

While existing frameworks offer partial solutions, they are constrained by oversimplified semantic representations and a lack of interpretability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Semantic Intent Decoding (SID), a novel framework that translates neural activity into natural language by modeling meaning as a flexible set of compositional semantic units. SID is built on three core principles: semantic compositionality, continuity and expandability of semantic space, and fidelity in reconstruction. We present BrainMosaic, a deep learning architecture implementing SID. BrainMosaic decodes multiple semantic units from EEG/SEEG signals using set matching and then reconstructs coherent sentences through semantic-guided reconstruction. This approach moves beyond traditional pipelines that rely on fixed-class classification or unconstrained generation, enabling a more interpretable and expressive communication paradigm. Extensive experiments on multilingual EEG and clinical SEEG datasets demonstrate that SID and BrainMosaic offer substantial advantages over existing frameworks, paving the way for natural and effective BCI-mediated communication.",

        "abstract": "Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is becoming increasingly essential for enhancing the transparency of machine learning (ML) models. Among the various XAI techniques, counterfactual explanations (CFs) hold a pivotal role due to their ability to illustrate how changes in input features can alter an ML model's decision, thereby offering actionable recourse to users. Ensuring that individuals with comparable attributes and those belonging to different protected groups (e.g., demographic) receive similar and actionable recourse options is essential for trustworthy and fair decision-making. In this work, we address this challenge directly by focusing on the generation of fair CFs. Specifically, we start by defining and formulating fairness at: 1) individual fairness, ensuring that similar individuals receive similar CFs, 2) group fairness, ensuring equitable CFs across different protected groups and 3) hybrid fairness, which accounts for both individual and broader group-level fairness. We formulate the problem as an optimization task and propose a novel model-agnostic, reinforcement learning based approach to generate CFs that satisfy fairness constraints at both the individual and group levels, two objectives that are usually treated as orthogonal. As fairness metrics, we extend existing metrics commonly used for auditing ML models, such as equal choice of recourse and equal effectiveness across individuals and groups. We evaluate our approach on three benchmark datasets, showing that it effectively ensures individual and group fairness while preserving the quality of the generated CFs in terms of proximity and plausibility, and quantify the cost of fairness in the different levels separately. Our work opens a broader discussion on hybrid fairness and its role and implications for XAI and beyond CFs.",

A corpus of 12,000 synthetic audio samples was generated using the Daily-Dialog dataset and evaluated against four detection frameworks, including semantic, structural, and signal-level approaches. The results reveal significant variability in detector performance across generative mechanisms: models effective against one TTS architecture may fail against others, particularly LLM-based synthesis. In contrast, a multi-view detection approach combining complementary analysis levels demonstrates robust performance across all evaluated models.

The interactions within these systems often lead to extreme events whose origins remain obscured by the black box of emergence. Interpreting these events is critical for system safety. This paper proposes the first framework for explaining emergent extreme events in multi-agent systems, aiming to answer three fundamental questions: When does the event originate? Who drives it? And what behaviors contribute to it? Specifically, we adapt the Shapley value to faithfully attribute the occurrence of extreme events to each action taken by agents at different time steps, i.e., assigning an attribution score to the action to measure its influence on the event. We then aggregate the attribution scores along the dimensions of time, agent, and behavior to quantify the risk contribution of each dimension. Finally, we design a set of metrics based on these contribution scores to characterize the features of extreme events. Experiments across diverse multi-agent system scenarios (economic, financial, and social) demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework and provide general insights into the emergence of extreme phenomena.",

        "abstract": "Unsupervised ensemble learning emerged to address the challenge of combining multiple learners' predictions without access to ground truth labels or additional data. This paradigm is crucial in scenarios where evaluating individual classifier performance or understanding their strengths is challenging due to limited information. We propose a novel deep energy-based method for constructing an accurate meta-learner using only the predictions of individual learners, potentially capable of capturing complex dependence structures between them. Our approach requires no labeled data, learner features, or problem-specific information, and has theoretical guarantees for when learners are conditionally independent. We demonstrate superior performance across diverse ensemble scenarios, including challenging mixture of experts settings. Our experiments span standard ensemble datasets and curated datasets designed to test how the model fuses expertise from multiple sources. These results highlight the potential of unsupervised ensemble learning to harness collective intelligence, especially in data-scarce or privacy-sensitive environments.",

        "abstract": "Specifications for decentralized learning on resource-constrained edge devices require algorithms that are communication-efficient, robust to data corruption, and lightweight in memory usage. While state-of-the-art gossip-based methods satisfy the first requirement, achieving robustness remains challenging. Asynchronous decentralized ADMM-based methods have been explored for estimating the median, a statistical centrality measure that is notoriously more robust than the mean. However, existing approaches require memory that scales with node degree, making them impractical when memory is limited. In this paper, we propose AsylADMM, a novel gossip algorithm for decentralized median and quantile estimation, primarily designed for asynchronous updates and requiring only two variables per node. We analyze a synchronous variant of AsylADMM to establish theoretical guarantees and empirically demonstrate fast convergence for the asynchronous algorithm. We then show that our algorithm enables quantile-based trimming, geometric median estimation, and depth-based trimming, with quantile-based trimming empirically outperforming existing rank-based methods. Finally, we provide a novel theoretical analysis of rank-based trimming via Markov chain theory.",

In this paper, we show that disparities arise not only from the structure of the network itself but also from differences in how commuters adapt to it. We model commuters as reinforcement learning agents who adapt their travel choices at different learning rates, reflecting unequal access to resources and information. To capture potential efficiency-fairness tradeoffs, we introduce the Price of Learning (PoL), a measure of inefficiency during learning. We analyze both a stylized network -- inspired in the well-known Braess's paradox, yet with two-source nodes -- and an abstraction of a real-world metro system (Amsterdam). Our simulations show that network expansions can simultaneously increase efficiency and amplify inequality, especially when faster learners disproportionately benefit from new routes before others adapt. These results highlight that transport policies must account not only for equilibrium outcomes but also for the heterogeneous ways commuters adapt, since both shape the balance between efficiency and fairness.",

In this paper, we propose a regularized optimization objective by reformulating the mean-square projected Bellman error (MSPBE) minimization.

To solve dynamic unbalanced optimal transport under the Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao geometry, we further build on this framework to develop Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao Mean Flow Matching (WFR-MFM). Across synthetic and real single-cell RNA sequencing datasets, WFR-MFM achieves orders-of-magnitude faster inference than a range of existing baselines while maintaining high predictive accuracy, and enables efficient perturbation response prediction on large synthetic datasets with thousands of conditions.",

In this paper, we first define such criteria based on a first-principles survey of public administration literature: benchmarks must be \\emph{process-based}, \\emph{realistic}, \\emph{public-sector-specific} and report \\emph{metrics} that reflect the unique requirements of the public sector. We analyse more than 1,300 benchmark papers for these criteria using an expert-validated LLM-assisted pipeline. Our results show that no single benchmark meets all of the criteria.

Recent memorization detection methods are primarily based on the norm of score difference as indicators of memorization. We prove that such norm-based metrics are mainly effective under the assumption of isotropic log-probability distributions, which generally holds at high or medium noise levels. In contrast, analyzing the anisotropic regime reveals that memorized samples exhibit strong angular alignment between the guidance vector and unconditional scores in the low-noise setting. Through these insights, we develop a memorization detection metric by integrating isotropic norm and anisotropic alignment. Our detection metric can be computed directly on pure noise inputs via two conditional and unconditional forward passes, eliminating the need for costly denoising steps. Detection experiments on Stable Diffusion v1.4 and v2 show that our metric outperforms existing denoising-free detection methods while being at least approximately 5x faster than the previous best approach. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by utilizing a mitigation strategy that adapts memorized prompts based on our developed metric.",

Machine-learning (ML) controllers are increasingly deployed in (autonomous) cyber-physical systems because of their ability to solve complex decision-making tasks. However, their accuracy can degrade sharply in unfamiliar environments, creating significant safety concerns. Traditional ensemble methods aim to improve robustness by averaging or voting across multiple controllers, yet this often dilutes the specialized strengths that individual controllers exhibit in different operating contexts. We argue that, rather than blending controller outputs, a monitoring framework should identify and exploit these contextual strengths. In this paper, we reformulate the design of safe AI-based control ensembles as a contextual monitoring problem. A monitor continuously observes the system's context and selects the controller best suited to the current conditions. To achieve this, we cast monitor learning as a contextual learning task and draw on techniques from contextual multi-armed bandits. Our approach comes with two key benefits: (1) theoretical safety guarantees during controller selection, and (2) improved utilization of controller diversity. We validate our framework in two simulated autonomous driving scenarios, demonstrating significant improvements in both safety and performance compared to non-contextual baselines.",

These processes demand large on-chip SRAM and involve irregular memory accesses that conventional NPUs struggle to handle efficiently.

Together, these optimizations deliver up to a 2.53x speedup over the NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPU under an equivalent nm technology node.

        "abstract": "This paper examines how Large Language Models (LLMs) reproduce societal norms, particularly heterocisnormativity, and how these norms translate into measurable biases in their text generations. We investigate whether explicit information about a subject's gender or sexuality influences LLM responses across three subject categories: queer-marked, non-queer-marked, and the normalized \"unmarked\" category. Representational imbalances are operationalized as measurable differences in English sentence completions across four dimensions: sentiment, regard, toxicity, and prediction diversity. Our findings show that Masked Language Models (MLMs) produce the least favorable sentiment, higher toxicity, and more negative regard for queer-marked subjects. Autoregressive Language Models (ARLMs) partially mitigate these patterns, while closed-access ARLMs tend to produce more harmful outputs for unmarked subjects. Results suggest that LLMs reproduce normative social assumptions, though the form and degree of bias depend strongly on specific model characteristics, which may redistribute, but not eliminate, representational harms.",

        "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) continue to scale, deployment is increasingly bottlenecked by the memory wall, motivating a shift toward extremely low-bit quantization. However, most quantization-aware training (QAT) methods apply hard rounding and the straight-through estimator (STE) from the beginning of the training, which prematurely discretizes the optimization landscape and induces persistent gradient mismatch between latent weights and quantized weights, hindering effective optimization of quantized models. To address this, we propose Hestia, a Hessian-guided differentiable QAT framework for extremely low-bit LLMs, which replaces the rigid step function with a temperature-controlled softmax relaxation to maintain gradient flow early in training while progressively hardening quantization. Furthermore, Hestia leverages a tensor-wise Hessian trace metric as a lightweight curvature signal to drive fine-grained temperature annealing, enabling sensitivity-aware discretization across the model. Evaluations on Llama-3.2 show that Hestia consistently outperforms existing ternary QAT baselines, yielding average zero-shot improvements of 5.39% and 4.34% for the 1B and 3B models. These results indicate that Hessian-guided relaxation effectively recovers representational capacity, establishing a more robust training path for 1.58-bit LLMs. The code is available at this https URL.",

        "abstract": "In an ordinal election, two candidates are said to be perfect clones if every voter ranks them adjacently. The independence of clones axiom then states that removing one of the two clones should not change the election outcome. This axiom has been extensively studied in social choice theory, and several voting rules are known to satisfy it (such as IRV, Ranked Pairs and Schulze). However, perfect clones are unlikely to occur in practice, especially for political elections with many voters. In this work, we study different notions of approximate clones in ordinal elections. Informally, two candidates are approximate clones in a preference profile if they are close to being perfect clones. We discuss two measures to quantify this proximity, and we show under which conditions the voting rules that are known to be independent of clones are also independent of approximate clones. In particular, we show that for elections with at least four candidates, none of these rules are independent of approximate clones in the general case. However, we find a more positive result for the case of three candidates. Finally, we conduct an empirical study of approximate clones and independence of approximate clones based on three real-world datasets: votes in local Scottish elections, votes in mini-jury deliberations, and votes of judges in figure skating competitions. We find that approximate clones are common in some contexts, and that the closest two candidates are to being perfect clones, the less likely their removal is to change the election outcome, especially for voting rules that are independent of perfect clones.",

Yet, current methods for reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) learn only from a scalar outcome reward per attempt, creating a severe credit-assignment bottleneck. Many verifiable environments actually provide rich textual feedback, such as runtime errors or judge evaluations, that explain why an attempt failed. We formalize this setting as reinforcement learning with rich feedback and introduce Self-Distillation Policy Optimization (SDPO), which converts tokenized feedback into a dense learning signal without any external teacher or explicit reward model. SDPO treats the current model conditioned on feedback as a self-teacher and distills its feedback-informed next-token predictions back into the policy. In this way, SDPO leverages the model's ability to retrospectively identify its own mistakes in-context. Across scientific reasoning, tool use, and competitive programming on LiveCodeBench v6, SDPO improves sample efficiency and final accuracy over strong RLVR baselines. Notably, SDPO also outperforms baselines in standard RLVR environments that only return scalar feedback by using successful rollouts as implicit feedback for failed attempts. Finally, applying SDPO to individual questions at test time accelerates discovery on difficult binary-reward tasks, achieving the same discovery probability as best-of-k sampling or multi-turn conversations with 3x fewer attempts.",

Although recent works have highlighted that these explanations can be suboptimal and potentially misleading, a characterization of their failure cases is unavailable. In this work, we identify a critical failure of SE-GNN explanations: explanations can be unambiguously unrelated to how the SE-GNNs infer labels. We show that, on the one hand, many SE-GNNs can achieve optimal true risk while producing these degenerate explanations, and on the other, most faithfulness metrics can fail to identify these failure modes. Our empirical analysis reveals that degenerate explanations can be maliciously planted (allowing an attacker to hide the use of sensitive attributes) and can also emerge naturally, highlighting the need for reliable auditing. To address this, we introduce a novel faithfulness metric that reliably marks degenerate explanations as unfaithful, in both malicious and natural settings.

We identify the core challenge as the poor accessibility of informative failures: learning signals exist but are rarely encountered during standard rollouts. To address this, we propose failure-prefix conditioning, a simple and effective method for learning from saturated problems. Rather than starting from the original question, our approach reallocates exploration by conditioning training on prefixes derived from rare incorrect reasoning trajectories, thereby exposing the model to failure-prone states. We observe that failure-prefix conditioning yields performance gains matching those of training on medium-difficulty problems, while preserving token efficiency. Furthermore, we analyze the model's robustness, finding that our method reduces performance degradation under misleading failure prefixes, albeit with a mild trade-off in adherence to correct early reasoning. Finally, we demonstrate that an iterative approach, which refreshes failure prefixes during training, unlocks additional gains after performance plateaus. Overall, our results suggest that failure-prefix conditioning offers an effective pathway to extend RLVR training on saturated problems.",

Because RMs are initialized from LLMs, they inherit representations that shape their behavior, but the nature and extent of this influence remain understudied. In a comprehensive study of 10 leading open-weight RMs using validated psycholinguistic corpora, we show that RMs exhibit significant differences along multiple dimensions of human value as a function of their base model. Using the \"Big Two\" psychological axes, we show a robust preference of Llama RMs for \"agency\" and a corresponding robust preference of Gemma RMs for \"communion.\" This phenomenon holds even when the preference data and finetuning process are identical, and we trace it back to the logits of the respective instruction-tuned and pre-trained models. These log-probability differences themselves can be formulated as an implicit RM; we derive usable implicit reward scores and show that they exhibit the very same agency/communion difference. We run experiments training RMs with ablations for preference data source and quantity, which demonstrate that this effect is not only repeatable but surprisingly durable. Despite RMs being designed to represent human preferences, our evidence shows that their outputs are influenced by the pretrained LLMs on which they are based. This work underscores the importance of safety and alignment efforts at the pretraining stage, and makes clear that open-source developers' choice of base model is as much a consideration of values as of performance.",

However, in real-world scenarios, diverse stakeholders may demand differing fairness requirements over time, so retraining for different fairness requirements becomes prohibitive. To address this limitation, we propose Cofair, a single-train framework that enables post-training fairness control in recommendation. Specifically, Cofair introduces a shared representation layer with fairness-conditioned adapter modules to produce user embeddings specialized for varied fairness levels, along with a user-level regularization term that guarantees user-wise monotonic fairness improvements across these levels. We theoretically establish that the adversarial objective of Cofair upper bounds demographic parity and the regularization term enforces progressive fairness at user level. Comprehensive experiments on multiple datasets and backbone models demonstrate that our framework provides dynamic fairness at different levels, delivering comparable or better fairness-accuracy curves than state-of-the-art baselines, without the need to retrain for each new fairness requirement.

We conduct experiments on 57 datasets from the OpenML CC18 suite and draw two main conclusions. First, results indicate that positioning Transformers to leverage latent and decoder representations leads to a trade-off between fidelity and diversity. Second, we observe a high similarity between consecutive blocks of a Transformer in all components.

Implementing such continually learning systems have several challenges, one of which is the large memory requirement of gradient-based algorithms that are used to train state-of-the-art LLMs. Evolutionary Strategies (ES) have recently re-emerged as a gradient-free alternative to traditional learning algorithms and have shown encouraging performance on specific tasks in LLMs. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive analysis of ES and specifically evaluate its forgetting curves when training for an increasing number of update steps. We first find that ES is able to reach performance numbers close to GRPO for math and reasoning tasks with a comparable compute budget. However, and most importantly for continual learning, the performance gains in ES is accompanied by significant forgetting of prior abilities, limiting its applicability for training models online. We also explore the reason behind this behavior and show that the updates made using ES are much less sparse and have orders of magnitude larger $\\ell_2$ norm compared to corresponding GRPO updates, explaining the contrasting forgetting curves between the two algorithms. With this study, we aim to highlight the issue of forgetting in gradient-free algorithms like ES and hope to inspire future work to mitigate these issues.",
