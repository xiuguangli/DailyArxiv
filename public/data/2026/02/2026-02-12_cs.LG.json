        "abstract": "Accurate prediction of functional outcomes after acute ischemic stroke can inform clinical decision-making and resource allocation. Prior work on modified Rankin Scale (mRS) prediction has relied primarily on structured variables (e.g., age, NIHSS) and conventional machine learning. The ability of large language models (LLMs) to infer future mRS scores directly from routine admission notes remains largely unexplored. We evaluated encoder (BERT, NYUTron) and generative (Llama-3.1-8B, MedGemma-4B) LLMs, in both frozen and fine-tuned settings, for discharge and 90-day mRS prediction using a large, real-world stroke registry. The discharge outcome dataset included 9,485 History and Physical notes and the 90-day outcome dataset included 1,898 notes from the NYU Langone Get With The Guidelines-Stroke registry (2016-2025). Data were temporally split with the most recent 12 months held out for testing. Performance was assessed using exact (7-class) mRS accuracy and binary functional outcome (mRS 0-2 vs. 3-6) accuracy and compared against established structured-data baselines incorporating NIHSS and age. Fine-tuned Llama achieved the highest performance, with 90-day exact mRS accuracy of 33.9% [95% CI, 27.9-39.9%] and binary accuracy of 76.3% [95% CI, 70.7-81.9%]. Discharge performance reached 42.0% [95% CI, 39.0-45.0%] exact accuracy and 75.0% [95% CI, 72.4-77.6%] binary accuracy. For 90-day prediction, Llama performed comparably to structured-data baselines. Fine-tuned LLMs can predict post-stroke functional outcomes from admission notes alone, achieving performance comparable to models requiring structured variable abstraction. Our findings support the development of text-based prognostic tools that integrate seamlessly into clinical workflows without manual data extraction.",

        "abstract": "Probabilistic forecasting is increasingly critical across high-stakes domains, from finance and epidemiology to climate science. However, current evaluation frameworks lack a consensus metric and suffer from two critical flaws: they often assume independence across time steps or variables, and they demonstrably lack sensitivity to tail events, the very occurrences that are most pivotal in real-world decision-making. To address these limitations, we propose two kernel-based metrics: the signature maximum mean discrepancy (Sig-MMD) and our novel censored Sig-MMD (CSig-MMD). By leveraging the signature kernel, these metrics capture complex inter-variate and inter-temporal dependencies and remain robust to missing data. Furthermore, CSig-MMD introduces a censoring scheme that prioritizes a forecaster's capability to predict tail events while strictly maintaining properness, a vital property for a good scoring rule. These metrics enable a more reliable evaluation of direct multi-step forecasting, facilitating the development of more robust probabilistic algorithms.",

By embedding states in the $Cl_{4,1}$ manifold and evolving them via geometric transformations (rotors), Versor natively represents $SE(3)$-equivariant relationships without requiring explicit structural encoding. Versor is validated on chaotic N-body dynamics, topological reasoning, and standard multimodal benchmarks (CIFAR-10, WikiText-103), consistently outperforming Transformers, Graph Networks, and geometric baselines (GATr, EGNN). Key results include: orders of magnitude fewer parameters ($200\\times$ vs. Transformers); interpretable attention decomposing into proximity and orientational components; zero-shot scale generalization (99.3% MCC on topology vs. 50.4% for ViT); and $O(L)$ linear complexity via the novel Recursive Rotor Accumulator. In out-of-distribution tests, Versor maintains stable predictions while Transformers fail catastrophically. Custom Clifford kernels achieve up to $78\\times$ speedup, providing a scalable foundation for geometrically-aware scientific modeling.",

MVN-Grad scales each coordinate by an exponential moving average of gradient uncertainty and applies momentum to the resulting normalized gradients, eliminating the cross-time coupling between stale momentum and a stochastic normalizer present in standard Adam-type updates. We prove that this decoupling yields strictly smaller one-step conditional update variance than momentum-then-normalize variance methods under standard noise assumptions, and that MVN-Grad is robust to outliers: it has a uniformly bounded response to single gradient spikes. In low-variance regimes, we further show variance normalization avoids sign-type collapse associated with second-moment scaling and can yield accelerated convergence. Across CIFAR-100 image classification and GPT-style language modeling benchmarks, MVN-Grad matches or outperforms Adam, AdaBelief, and LaProp, delivering smoother training and improved generalization with no added overhead.",

We compute the two-point function in an attention-weight representation and show how Euclidean-invariant kernels can be engineered via random-feature token embeddings. We then analyze the connected four-point function and identify an \"independence-breaking\" contribution, expressible as a covariance over query-key weights, which remains finite at infinite width.

Augmenting LLMs with hybrid external knowledge, such as unstructured text and structured knowledge graphs, offers a promising alternative to costly continual pretraining. As such, reliable evaluation of their retrieval and reasoning capabilities becomes critical. However, many existing benchmarks increasingly overlap with LLM pretraining data, which means answers or supporting knowledge may already be encoded in model parameters, making it difficult to distinguish genuine retrieval and reasoning from parametric recall. We introduce HybridRAG-Bench, a framework for constructing benchmarks to evaluate retrieval-intensive, multi-hop reasoning over hybrid knowledge. HybridRAG-Bench automatically couples unstructured text and structured knowledge graph representations derived from recent scientific literature on arXiv, and generates knowledge-intensive question-answer pairs grounded in explicit reasoning paths. The framework supports flexible domain and time-frame selection, enabling contamination-aware and customizable evaluation as models and knowledge evolve. Experiments across three domains (artificial intelligence, governance and policy, and bioinformatics) demonstrate that HybridRAG-Bench rewards genuine retrieval and reasoning rather than parametric recall, offering a principled testbed for evaluating hybrid knowledge-augmented reasoning systems.

In this work, we compare the accuracy of rank-r LoRA updates against full-parameter updates for fine-tuning tasks from a dynamical systems perspective. We perform gradient flow analysis in both full-rank and low-rank regimes to establish explicit relationships between rank and accuracy for two loss functions under LoRA. While gradient flow equations for LoRA are presented in prior work, we rigorously derive their form and show that they are identical for simultaneous and sequential LoRA parameter updates. We then use the resulting dynamical system equations to obtain closed-form relationships between LoRA rank and accuracy for trace-squared and Frobenius-norm low-rank approximation loss functions.",

To that end, we collect a set of gradients obtained by backpropagating the differences between stochastic realizations of a fixed prompt that we later decompose into meaningful steering directions with either Principal Components Analysis or Sparse Autoencoder. Our approach yields three key contributions: (1) it isolates interpretable, steerable directions for precise, fine-grained control over a single concept; (2) it effectively mitigates mode collapse in distilled models by reintroducing lost diversity; and (3) it establishes a novel estimator for concept complexity under a specific model, based on the dimensionality of the discovered subspace.",

While classifier guidance is a standard approach for approximating this ratio and can succeed in general, we show it can fail to faithfully unlearn with finite samples when the forget set represents a sharp, concentrated data distribution. To address this, we introduce Temper-Then-Tilt Unlearning (T3-Unlearning), which freezes the base model and applies a two-step inference procedure: (i) tempering the base distribution to flatten high-confidence spikes, and (ii) tilting the tempered distribution using a lightweight classifier trained to distinguish retain from forget samples. Our theoretical analysis provides finite-sample guarantees linking the surrogate classifier's risk to unlearning error, proving that tempering is necessary to successfully unlearn for concentrated distributions. Empirical evaluations on the TOFU benchmark show that T3-Unlearning improves forget quality and generative utility over existing baselines, while training only a fraction of the parameters with a minimal runtime.",

We propose a self-evolving system that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically those from Google's Gemini family, to autonomously generate, train, and deploy high-performing, complex model changes within an end-to-end automated workflow. The self-evolving system is comprised of an Offline Agent (Inner Loop) that performs high-throughput hypothesis generation using proxy metrics, and an Online Agent (Outer Loop) that validates candidates against delayed north star business metrics in live production. Our agents act as specialized Machine Learning Engineers (MLEs): they exhibit deep reasoning capabilities, discovering novel improvements in optimization algorithms and model architecture, and formulating innovative reward functions that target long-term user engagement. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through several successful production launches at YouTube, confirming that autonomous, LLM-driven evolution can surpass traditional engineering workflows in both development velocity and model performance.",

However, achieving this protection typically requires adding noise, and noise can accumulate when many statistics are measured. Existing DP synthetic data methods treat all features symmetrically, spreading noise uniformly even when the data will serve a specific prediction task. We develop a prediction-centric approach operating in three regimes depending on available structural knowledge. In the causal regime, when the causal parents of $Y$ are known and distribution shift is expected, we target the parents for robustness. In the graphical regime, when a Bayesian network structure is available and the distribution is stable, the Markov blanket of $Y$ provides a sufficient feature set for optimal prediction. In the predictive regime, when no structural knowledge exists, we select features via differentially private methods without claiming to recover causal or graphical structure. We formalize this as PRISM, a mechanism that (i) identifies a predictive feature subset according to the appropriate regime, (ii) constructs targeted summary statistics, (iii) allocates budget to minimize an upper bound on prediction error, and (iv) synthesizes data via graphical-model inference. We prove end-to-end privacy guarantees and risk bounds. Empirically, task-aware allocation improves prediction accuracy compared to generic synthesizers. Under distribution shift, targeting causal parents achieves AUC $\\approx 0.73$ while correlation-based selection collapses to chance ($\\approx 0.49$).",

In this work, we propose frame-level internal tool use, a method that trains audio LMs to use their own internal audio representations to perform temporal grounding directly. We introduce a lightweight prediction mechanism trained via two objectives: a binary frame classifier and a novel inhomogeneous Poisson process (IHP) loss that models temporal event intensity. Across word localization, speaker diarization, and event localization tasks, our approach outperforms token-based baselines.

A patient with a rare disease combination or a transaction with unusual characteristics stands out from the crowd. Differential privacy provides worst-case guarantees, but empirical attacks -- particularly membership inference -- succeed far more often against such outliers, especially under moderate privacy budgets and with auxiliary information. This paper introduces risk-equalized DP synthesis, a framework that prioritizes protection for high-risk records by reducing their influence on the learned generator. The mechanism operates in two stages: first, a small privacy budget estimates each record's \"outlierness\"; second, a DP learning procedure weights each record inversely to its risk score. Under Gaussian mechanisms, a record's privacy loss is proportional to its influence on the output -- so deliberately shrinking outliers' contributions yields tighter per-instance privacy bounds for precisely those records that need them most. We prove end-to-end DP guarantees via composition and derive closed-form per-record bounds for the synthesis stage (the scoring stage adds a uniform per-record term). Experiments on simulated data with controlled outlier injection show that risk-weighting substantially reduces membership inference success against high-outlierness records; ablations confirm that targeting -- not random downweighting -- drives the improvement. On real-world benchmarks (Breast Cancer, Adult, German Credit), gains are dataset-dependent, highlighting the interplay between scorer quality and synthesis pipeline.",

To generate recommendations, we compute the cosine similarity between student profiles and problem skill vectors, ranking exercises according to their alignment with each student's current abilities. We evaluated our approach using real data from students and exercises in an introductory programming course at our university. First, we assessed the effectiveness of our source code embeddings for predicting skills, comparing them with token-based and graph-based alternatives. Results showed that Jina embeddings outperformed TF-IDF, CodeBERT-cpp, and GraphCodeBERT across most skills. Additionally, we evaluated the system's ability to recommend exercises aligned with weekly course content by analyzing student submissions collected over seven course offerings. Our approach consistently produced more suitable recommendations than baselines based on correctness or solution time, indicating that predicted programming skills provide a stronger signal for problem recommendation.",

However, single kernel approaches are inherently limited, as they rely on a single type of kernel function (e.g., Gaussian kernel), which may be insufficient to fully represent the heterogeneity or multifaceted nature of real-world data. Multiple kernel learning (MKL) addresses these limitations by constructing composite kernels from simpler ones and integrating information from heterogeneous sources. Despite these advances, traditional MKL methods are primarily designed for continuous outcomes. We extend MKL to accommodate the outcome variable belonging to the exponential family, representing a broader variety of data types, and refer to our proposed method as generalized linear models with integrated multiple additive regression with kernels (GLIMARK). Empirically, we demonstrate that GLIMARK can effectively recover or approximate the true data-generating mechanism. We have applied it to a COVID-19 chest X-ray dataset, predicting binary outcomes of ICU escalation and extracting clinically meaningful features, underscoring the practical utility of this approach in real-world scenarios.",

Our experiments show several challenges in such benchmarking tasks, namely, strong stochasticity in the results in some of the models and susceptibility to DAG misspecification via spurious edges in the continuous domains. Across models, we observe substantial variability in coefficient estimates for some settings and sensitivity to structural and semantic perturbations, highlighting current limitations of LLMs as quantitative causal parameterizers.

Standard practice assumes data follows this model and learns the latent scores accordingly. However, real data may violate this assumption, and it remains unclear what BT learning recovers in such cases. Starting from triplet comparison data, we formalize the preference information it encodes through the conditional preference distribution (CPRD). We give precise conditions for when BT is appropriate for modeling the CPRD, and identify factors governing sample efficiency -- namely, margin and connectivity.

To improve predictability across a broader set of hyperparameters and enable simpler tuning at scale, we propose learning a \\textit{Configuration-to-Performance Scaling Law} (CPL): a mapping from the \\textit{full training configuration} to training performance. Because no simple functional form can express this mapping, we parameterize it with a large language model (LLM), and fit it with diverse open-source pretraining logs across multiple sources, yielding a \\textit{Neural} Configuration-to-Performance Scaling Law (NCPL). NCPL accurately predicts how training configurations influence the final pretraining loss, achieving 20-40% lower prediction error than the configuration-agnostic Chinchilla law and generalizing to runs using up to 10 x more compute than any run in the training set. It further supports joint tuning of multiple hyperparameters with performance comparable to hyperparameter scaling law baselines. Finally, NCPL naturally and effectively extends to richer prediction targets such as loss-curve prediction.",

Many existing survival analysis approaches for interval-censored data rely on strong model assumptions or cannot handle high-dimensional predictors. We develop ICODEN, an ordinary differential equation-based neural network for interval-censored data that models the hazard function through deep neural networks and obtains the cumulative hazard by solving an ordinary differential equation. ICODEN does not require the proportional hazards assumption or a prespecified parametric form for the hazard function, thereby permitting flexible survival modeling. Across simulation settings with proportional or non-proportional hazards and both linear and nonlinear covariate effects, ICODEN consistently achieves satisfactory predictive accuracy and remains stable as the number of predictors increases. Applications to data from multiple phases of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and to two Age-Related Eye Disease Studies (AREDS and AREDS2) for age-related macular degeneration (AMD) demonstrate ICODEN's robust prediction performance. In both applications, predicting time-to-AD or time-to-late AMD, ICODEN effectively uses hundreds to more than 1,000 SNPs and supports data-driven subgroup identification with differential progression risk profiles. These results establish ICODEN as a practical assumption-lean tool for prediction with interval-censored survival data in high-dimensional biomedical settings.",

Building on an existing supervised tabular predictor, the framework constructs a reasoning-centric knowledge base composed of labeled tabular records, where each sample includes structured predictors, a compact natural language text-mode summary, and a model-generated reasoning trajectory. During inference, R2RAG-Flood issues context-augmented prompts that retrieve and condition on relevant reasoning trajectories from nearby geospatial neighbors and canonical class prototypes, enabling the large language model backbone to emulate and adapt prior reasoning rather than learn new task-specific parameters. Predictions follow a two-stage procedure that first determines property damage occurrence and then refines severity within a three-level Property Damage Extent categorization, with a conditional downgrade step to correct over-predicted severity. In a case study of Harris County, Texas at the 12-digit Hydrologic Unit Code scale, the supervised tabular baseline trained directly on structured predictors achieves 0.714 overall accuracy and 0.859 damage class accuracy for medium and high damage classes. Across seven large language model backbones, R2RAG-Flood attains 0.613 to 0.668 overall accuracy and 0.757 to 0.896 damage class accuracy, approaching the supervised baseline while additionally producing a structured rationale for each prediction. Using a severity-per-cost efficiency metric derived from API pricing and GPU instance costs, lightweight R2RAG-Flood variants demonstrate substantially higher efficiency than both the supervised tabular baseline and larger language models, while requiring no task-specific training or fine-tuning.",

Second, we use OpenScholar (quantized LLaMA 3.1 8B) to classify papers and extract structured fields like nudge type and target behavior in a single pass, validated against a JSON schema. We evaluated four configurations on a labeled test set (N=197). The best setup (Title/Abstract/Intro) achieved a 67.0% F1 score and 72.0% recall, ideal for discovery. A high-precision variant using self-consistency (7 randomized passes) achieved 100% precision with 12% recall, demonstrating a tunable trade-off for high-trust use cases.

In this work, we develop a theoretical framework to analyze the training dynamics of contrastive learning with Transformer-based encoders under imbalanced data. Our results reveal that neuron weights evolve through three distinct stages of training, with different dynamics for majority features, minority features, and noise. We further show that minority features reduce representational capacity, increase the need for more complex architectures, and hinder the separation of ground-truth features from noise. Inspired by these neuron-level behaviors, we show that pruning restores performance degraded by imbalance and enhances feature separation, offering both conceptual insights and practical guidance.

        "abstract": "Vision-Language-Action Models (VLAs) have emerged as a key paradigm of Physical AI and are increasingly deployed in autonomous vehicles, robots, and smart spaces. In these resource-constrained on-device settings, selecting an appropriate large language model (LLM) backbone is a critical challenge: models must balance accuracy with strict inference latency and hardware efficiency constraints. This makes hardware-software co-design a game-changing requirement for on-device LLM deployment, where each hardware platform demands a tailored architectural solution. We propose a hardware co-design law that jointly captures model accuracy and inference performance. Specifically, we model training loss as an explicit function of architectural hyperparameters and characterise inference latency via roofline modelling. We empirically evaluate 1,942 candidate architectures on NVIDIA Jetson Orin, training 170 selected models for 10B tokens each to fit a scaling law relating architecture to training loss. By coupling this scaling law with latency modelling, we establish a direct accuracy-latency correspondence and identify the Pareto frontier for hardware co-designed LLMs. We further formulate architecture search as a joint optimisation over precision and performance, deriving feasible design regions under industrial hardware and application budgets. Our approach reduces architecture selection from months to days. At the same latency as Qwen2.5-0.5B on the target hardware, our co-designed architecture achieves 19.42% lower perplexity on WikiText-2. To our knowledge, this is the first principled and operational framework for hardware co-design scaling laws in on-device LLM deployment. We will make the code and related checkpoints publicly available.",

This study provides the first comprehensive assessment of machine learning and deep learning methodologies for identifying malnutrition among children under five years of age in Nepal. We systematically compared 16 algorithms spanning deep learning, gradient boosting, and traditional machine learning families, using data from the Nepal Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) 2019. A composite malnutrition indicator was constructed by integrating stunting, wasting, and underweight status, and model performance was evaluated using ten metrics, with emphasis on F1-score and recall to account for substantial class imbalance and the high cost of failing to detect malnourished children. Among all models, TabNet demonstrated the best performance, likely attributable to its attention-based architecture, and outperformed both support vector machine and AdaBoost classifiers. A consensus feature importance analysis identified maternal education, household wealth index, and child age as the primary predictors of malnutrition, followed by geographic characteristics, vaccination status, and meal frequency. Collectively, these results demonstrate a scalable, survey-based screening framework for identifying children at elevated risk of malnutrition and for guiding targeted nutritional interventions. The proposed approach supports Nepal's progress toward the Sustainable Development Goals and offers a transferable methodological template for similar low-resource settings globally.",

While LLMs excel at processing unstructured text, graph tasks require reasoning over explicit structure, permutation invariance, and computationally complex relationships, creating a mismatch with the representations of text-based models. Our work investigates how LLMs can be effectively applied to graph problems despite these barriers. We introduce a human-interpretable structural encoding strategy for graph-to-text translation that injects graph structure directly into natural language prompts. Our method involves computing a variant of Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) similarity classes and maps them to human-like color tokens rather than numeric labels. The key insight is that semantically meaningful and human-interpretable cues may be more effectively processed by LLMs than opaque symbolic encoding. Experimental results on multiple algorithmic and predictive graph tasks show the considerable improvements by our method on both synthetic and real-world datasets. By capturing both local and global-range dependencies, our method enhances LLM performance especially on graph tasks that require reasoning over global graph structure.",

        "abstract": "When designing new materials, it is often necessary to tailor the material design (with respect to its design parameters) to have some desired properties (e.g. Young's modulus). As the set of design parameters grow, the search space grows exponentially, making the actual synthesis and evaluation of all material combinations virtually impossible. Even using traditional computational methods such as Finite Element Analysis becomes too computationally heavy to search the design space. Recent methods use machine learning (ML) surrogate models to more efficiently determine optimal material designs; unfortunately, these methods often (i) are notoriously difficult to interpret and (ii) under perform when the training data comes from a non-uniform sampling of the design space. We suggest the use of tensor completion methods as an all-in-one approach for interpretability and predictions. We observe classical tensor methods are able to compete with traditional ML in predictions, with the added benefit of their interpretable tensor factors (which are given completely for free, as a result of the prediction). In our experiments, we are able to rediscover physical phenomena via the tensor factors, indicating that our predictions are aligned with the true underlying physics of the problem. This also means these tensor factors could be used by experimentalists to identify potentially novel patterns, given we are able to rediscover existing ones. We also study the effects of both types of surrogate models when we encounter training data from a non-uniform sampling of the design space. We observe more specialized tensor methods that can give better generalization in these non-uniforms sampling scenarios. We find the best generalization comes from a tensor model, which is able to improve upon the baseline ML methods by up to 5% on aggregate $R^2$, and halve the error in some out of distribution regions.",

We revisit this assumption for pre-norm Transformers and ask to what extent sample-dependent normalization is needed inside Transformer blocks. We introduce TaperNorm, a drop-in replacement for RMSNorm/LayerNorm that behaves exactly like the standard normalizer early in training and then smoothly tapers to a learned sample-independent linear/affine map. A single global gate is held at $g{=}1$ during gate warmup, used to calibrate the scaling branch via EMAs, and then cosine-decayed to $g{=}0$, at which point per-token statistics vanish and the resulting fixed scalings can be folded into adjacent linear projections. Our theoretical and empirical results isolate scale anchoring as the key role played by output normalization: as a (near) $0$-homogeneous map it removes radial gradients at the output, whereas without such an anchor cross-entropy encourages unbounded logit growth (``logit chasing''). We further show that a simple fixed-target auxiliary loss on the pre-logit residual-stream scale provides an explicit alternative anchor and can aid removal of the final normalization layer. Empirically, TaperNorm matches normalized baselines under identical setups while eliminating per-token statistics and enabling these layers to be folded into adjacent linear projections at inference. On an efficiency microbenchmark, folding internal scalings yields up to $1.22\\times$ higher throughput in last-token logits mode. These results take a step towards norm-free Transformers while identifying the special role output normalization plays.",

However, as context lengths increase, a fundamental limitation of the softmax function emerges: it tends to diffuse probability mass to irrelevant tokens degrading performance in long-sequence scenarios. Furthermore, attempts to sharpen focus by lowering softmax temperature hinder learnability due to vanishing gradients. We introduce LUCID Attention, an architectural modification that applies a preconditioner to the attention probabilities. This preconditioner, derived from exponentiated key-key similarities, minimizes overlap between the keys in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space, thus allowing the query to focus on important keys among large number of keys accurately with same computational complexity as standard attention. Additionally, LUCID's preconditioning-based approach to retrieval bypasses the need for low temperature and the learnability problems associated with it. We validate our approach by training ~1 billion parameter language models evaluated on up to 128K tokens. Our results demonstrate significant gains on long-context retrieval tasks, specifically retrieval tasks from BABILong, RULER, SCROLLS and LongBench. For instance, LUCID achieves up to 18% improvement in BABILong and 14% improvement in RULER multi-needle performance compared to standard attention.",

Evidential deep learning (EDL) provides a theoretically grounded single-model alternative that determines both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in a single forward pass. However, extending evidential formulations from scalar targets to vector-valued quantities such as atomic forces introduces substantial challenges, particularly in maintaining statistical self-consistency under rotational transformations. To address this, we propose \\textit{Equivariant Evidential Deep Learning for Interatomic Potentials} ($\\text{e}^2$IP), a backbone-agnostic framework that models atomic forces and their uncertainty jointly by representing uncertainty as a full $3\\times3$ symmetric positive definite covariance tensor that transforms equivariantly under rotations.

In this work, we investigate the transfer of this paradigm to binary manifolds, a fundamental setting for generative modeling of discrete data. While $x$-prediction remains effective, we identify a latent structural mismatch that arises when it is coupled with velocity-based objectives ($v$-loss), leading to a time-dependent singular weighting that amplifies gradient sensitivity to approximation errors. Motivated by this observation, we formalize prediction-loss alignment as a necessary condition for flow matching training. We prove that re-aligning the objective to the signal space ($x$-loss) eliminates the singular weighting, yielding uniformly bounded gradients and enabling robust training under uniform timestep sampling without reliance on heuristic schedules. Finally, with alignment secured, we examine design choices specific to binary data, revealing a topology-dependent distinction between probabilistic objectives (e.g., cross-entropy) and geometric losses (e.g., mean squared error). Together, these results provide theoretical foundations and practical guidelines for robust flow matching on binary -- and related discrete -- domains, positioning signal-space alignment as a key principle for robust diffusion learning.",

Two complementary approaches have emerged to address these issues: token-adaptive layer execution, which reduces floating-point operations (FLOPs) by selectively bypassing layers, and quantization, which lowers memory footprint by reducing weight precision. However, naively integrating these techniques leads to additional accuracy degradation due to reduced redundancy in token-adaptive models. We propose QTALE (Quantization-Robust Token-Adaptive Layer Execution for LLMs), a novel framework that enables seamless integration of token-adaptive execution with quantization while preserving accuracy. Conventional token-adaptive methods reduce redundancy in two ways: (1) by limiting the diversity of training paths explored during fine-tuning, and (2) by lowering the number of parameters actively involved in inference. To overcome these limitations, QTALE introduces two key components: (1) a training strategy that ensures diverse execution paths are actively explored during fine-tuning, and (2) a post-training mechanism that allows flexible adjustment of the execution ratio at inference to reintroduce redundancy when needed. Experimental results show that QTALE enables seamless integration of token-adaptive layer execution with quantization, showing no noticeable accuracy difference, with the gap to quantization-only models kept below 0.5% on CommonsenseQA benchmarks. By combining token-adaptive execution for FLOPs reduction and quantization for memory savings, QTALE provides an effective solution for efficient LLM deployment.",

        "abstract": "Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC) is a widely-used clustering method based on repeatedly merging the closest pair of clusters, where inter-cluster distances are determined by a linkage function. Unlike many clustering methods, HAC does not optimize a single explicit global objective; clustering quality is therefore primarily evaluated empirically, and the choice of linkage function plays a crucial role in practice. However, popular classical linkages, such as single-linkage, average-linkage and Ward's method show high variability across real-world datasets and do not consistently produce high-quality clusterings in practice. In this paper, we propose \\emph{Chamfer-linkage}, a novel linkage function that measures the distance between clusters using the Chamfer distance, a popular notion of distance between point-clouds in machine learning and computer vision. We argue that Chamfer-linkage satisfies desirable concept representation properties that other popular measures struggle to satisfy. Theoretically, we show that Chamfer-linkage HAC can be implemented in $O(n^2)$ time, matching the efficiency of classical linkage functions. Experimentally, we find that Chamfer-linkage consistently yields higher-quality clusterings than classical linkages such as average-linkage and Ward's method across a diverse collection of datasets. Our results establish Chamfer-linkage as a practical drop-in replacement for classical linkage functions, broadening the toolkit for hierarchical clustering in both theory and practice.",

Although large language models (LLMs) have been explored for this task, evaluation is still dominated by toy-sized or synthetic benchmarks, masking the difficulty of industrial problems with $10^{3}$--$10^{6}$ (or more) variables and constraints. A key bottleneck is the lack of benchmarks that align natural-language specifications with reference formulations/solver code grounded in real optimization models. To fill in this gap, we introduce MIPLIB-NL, built via a structure-aware reverse construction methodology from real mixed-integer linear programs in MIPLIB~2017. Our pipeline (i) recovers compact, reusable model structure from flat solver formulations, (ii) reverse-generates natural-language specifications explicitly tied to this recovered structure under a unified model--data separation format, and (iii) performs iterative semantic validation through expert review and human--LLM interaction with independent reconstruction checks. This yields 223 one-to-one reconstructions that preserve the mathematical content of the original instances while enabling realistic natural-language-to-optimization evaluation. Experiments show substantial performance degradation on MIPLIB-NL for systems that perform strongly on existing benchmarks, exposing failure modes invisible at toy scale.",

In such settings, learning the full conditional distribution of admissible outcomes in a physically consistent and interpretable manner remains a challenge. While recent advances in machine learning have enabled powerful multimodal generative modeling, their integration with physics-constrained scientific modeling remains nontrivial, particularly when physical structure must be preserved or data are limited. This work develops a physics-informed multimodal conditional modeling framework based on mixture density representations. Mixture density networks (MDNs) provide an explicit and interpretable parameterization of multimodal conditional distributions. Physical knowledge is embedded through component-specific regularization terms that penalize violations of governing equations or physical laws. This formulation naturally accommodates non-uniqueness and stochasticity while remaining computationally efficient and amenable to conditioning on contextual inputs. The proposed framework is evaluated across a range of scientific problems in which multimodality arises from intrinsic physical mechanisms rather than observational noise, including bifurcation phenomena in nonlinear dynamical systems, stochastic partial differential equations, and atomistic-scale shock dynamics. In addition, the proposed method is compared with a conditional flow matching (CFM) model, a representative state-of-the-art generative modeling approach, demonstrating that MDNs can achieve competitive performance while offering a simpler and more interpretable formulation.",

        "abstract": "Interpreting the inference-time behavior of deep neural networks remains a challenging problem. Existing approaches to counterfactual explanation typically ask: What is the closest alternative input that would alter the model's prediction in a desired way? In contrast, we explore counterfactual datasets. Rather than perturbing the input, our method efficiently finds the closest alternative training dataset, one that differs from the original dataset by changing a few labels. Training a new model on this altered dataset can then lead to a different prediction of a given test instance. This perspective provides a new way to assess fairness by directly analyzing the influence of label bias on training and inference. Our approach can be characterized as probing whether a given prediction depends on biased labels. Since exhaustively enumerating all possible alternate datasets is infeasible, we develop analysis techniques that trace how bias in the training data may propagate through the learning algorithm to the trained network. Our method heuristically ranks and modifies the labels of a bounded number of training examples to construct a counterfactual dataset, retrains the model, and checks whether its prediction on a chosen test case changes. We evaluate our approach on feedforward neural networks across over 1100 test cases from 7 widely-used fairness datasets. Results show that it modifies only a small subset of training labels, highlighting its ability to pinpoint the critical training examples that drive prediction changes. Finally, we demonstrate how our counterfactual datasets reveal connections between training examples and test cases, offering an interpretable way to probe dataset bias.",

Existing methods attempt to reduce distributional shifts by aligning manually selected graph elements (e.g., node attributes or structural statistics), which typically require manually designed graph filters to extract relevant features before alignment. However, such approaches are inflexible: they rely on scenario-specific heuristics, and struggle when dominant discrepancies vary across transfer scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose \\textbf{ADAlign}, an Adaptive Distribution Alignment framework for GDA. Unlike heuristic methods, ADAlign requires no manual specification of alignment criteria. It automatically identifies the most relevant discrepancies in each transfer and aligns them jointly, capturing the interplay between attributes, structures, and their dependencies. This makes ADAlign flexible, scenario-aware, and robust to diverse and dynamically evolving shifts. To enable this adaptivity, we introduce the Neural Spectral Discrepancy (NSD), a theoretically principled parametric distance that provides a unified view of cross-graph shifts. NSD leverages neural characteristic function in the spectral domain to encode feature-structure dependencies of all orders, while a learnable frequency sampler adaptively emphasizes the most informative spectral components for each task via minimax paradigm. Extensive experiments on 10 datasets and 16 transfer tasks show that ADAlign not only outperforms state-of-the-art baselines but also achieves efficiency gains with lower memory usage and faster training.",

To explain the gap between worst-case hardness and empirical success, we introduce problem distributions generated by a reference policy $q$, including a latent-variable model in which proofs exhibit reusable cut/lemma/sketch structure represented by a proof DAG. Under a top-$k$ search protocol and Tsybakov-type margin conditions, we derive lower bounds on finite-horizon success probability that decompose into search and learning terms, with learning controlled by sequential Rademacher/covering complexity. Our main separation result shows that when cut elimination expands a DAG of depth $D$ into a cut-free tree of size $\\Omega(\\Lambda^D)$ while the cut-aware hierarchical process has size $O(\\lambda^D)$ with $\\lambda\\ll\\Lambda$, a flat (cut-free) learner provably requires exponentially more data than a cut-aware hierarchical learner.

To resolve this, we introduce RLTT (Reward Latent Thought Trajectories), a reinforcement learning framework which distributes reward across the full latent reasoning trajectory. RLTT provides dense, trajectory-level credit assignment without relying on external verifiers and can directly replace GRPO with negligible overhead. Across extensive experiments with Ouro-2.6B-Thinking under identical training and inference conditions, RLTT yields substantial improvements over GRPO on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks, improving accuracy by +14.4% on MATH-500, +16.6% on AIME24, and +10.0% on BeyondAIME.

Through systematic investigation, we uncover the mechanisms underlying these bottlenecks, revealing that simple yet principled solutions suffice: base-policy transitions serve as an essential value anchor for implicit warmup, and critic normalization effectively restores representation sensitivity for discerning value differences.

        "abstract": "Standard large language model training can create models that produce outputs their trainer deems unacceptable in deployment. The probability of these outputs can be reduced using methods such as LLM unlearning. However, unlearning a set of data (called the forget set) can degrade model performance on other distributions where the trainer wants to retain the model's behavior. To improve this trade-off, we demonstrate that using the forget set to compute only a few uphill Gauss-Newton steps provides a conceptually simple, state-of-the-art unlearning approach for LLMs. While Gauss-Newton steps adapt Newton's method to non-linear models, it is non-trivial to efficiently and accurately compute such steps for LLMs. Hence, our approach crucially relies on parametric Hessian approximations such as Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (K-FAC). We call this combined approach K-FADE (K-FAC for Distribution Erasure). Our evaluation on the WMDP and ToFU benchmarks demonstrates that K-FADE suppresses outputs from the forget set and approximates, in output space, the results of retraining without the forget set. Critically, our method does this while altering the outputs on the retain set less than previous methods. This is because K-FADE transforms a constraint on the model's outputs across the entire retain set into a constraint on the model's weights, allowing the algorithm to minimally change the model's behavior on the retain set at each step. Moreover, the unlearning updates computed by K-FADE can be reapplied later if the model undergoes further training, allowing unlearning to be cheaply maintained.",

Recent approaches have successfully leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate equation hypotheses, capitalizing on their vast pre-trained scientific priors. However, existing frameworks predominantly treat the LLM as a static generator, relying on prompt-level guidance to steer exploration. This paradigm fails to update the model's internal representations based on search feedback, often yielding physically inconsistent or mathematically redundant expressions. In this work, we propose PiT-PO (Physics-informed Token-regularized Policy Optimization), a unified framework that evolves the LLM into an adaptive generator via reinforcement learning. Central to PiT-PO is a dual-constraint mechanism that rigorously enforces hierarchical physical validity while simultaneously applying fine-grained, token-level penalties to suppress redundant structures. Consequently, PiT-PO aligns LLM to produce equations that are both scientifically consistent and structurally parsimonious. Empirically, PiT-PO achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks and successfully discovers novel turbulence models for challenging fluid dynamics problems. We also demonstrate that PiT-PO empowers small-scale models to outperform closed-source giants, democratizing access to high-performance scientific discovery.",

The clipping threshold is a critical control knob: if set too small, systematic over-clipping induces optimization bias; if too large, injected noise dominates updates and degrades accuracy. Existing adaptive clipping methods often depend on per-example gradient norm statistics, adding computational overhead and introducing sensitivity to datasets and architectures. We propose a control-driven clipping strategy that adapts the threshold using a lightweight, weight-only spectral diagnostic computed from model parameters. At periodic probe steps, the method analyzes a designated weight matrix via spectral decomposition and estimates a heavy-tailed spectral indicator associated with training stability. This indicator is smoothed over time and fed into a bounded feedback controller that updates the clipping threshold multiplicatively in the log domain. Because the controller uses only parameters produced during privacy-preserving training, the resulting threshold updates are post-processing and do not increase privacy loss beyond that of the underlying DP optimizer under standard composition accounting.",

To address this, we study the two-model risk change, $\\Delta R := R_P(\\tilde{Q}) - R_P(Q)$, under covariate shift. We introduce TRACE (Theoretical Risk Attribution under Covariate-shift Effects), a framework that decomposes $|\\Delta R|$ into an interpretable upper bound. This decomposition disentangles the risk change into four actionable factors: two generalization gaps, a model change penalty, and a covariate shift penalty, transforming the bound into a powerful diagnostic tool for understanding why performance has changed. To make TRACE a fully computable diagnostic, we instantiate each term. The covariate shift penalty is estimated via a model sensitivity factor (from high-quantile input gradients) and a data-shift measure; we use feature-space Optimal Transport (OT) by default and provide a robust alternative using Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). The model change penalty is controlled by the average output distance between the two models on the target sample. Generalization gaps are estimated on held-out data. We validate our framework in an idealized linear regression setting, showing the TRACE bound correctly captures the scaling of the true risk difference with the magnitude of the shift. Across synthetic and vision benchmarks, TRACE diagnostics are valid and maintain a strong monotonic relationship with the true performance degradation. Crucially, we derive a deployment gate score that correlates strongly with $|\\Delta R|$ and achieves high AUROC/AUPRC for gating decisions, enabling safe, label-efficient model replacement.",

Specifically, we interpret mixture density networks as deep latent-variable models and analyze them through an expectation maximization framework, which reveals surprising theoretical connections to natural gradient descent. We then exploit such connections to derive the natural gradient expectation maximization (nGEM) objective.

        "abstract": "Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have gained significant attention as a surrogate modeling strategy for partial differential equations (PDEs), particularly in regimes where labeled data are scarce and physical constraints can be leveraged to regularize the learning process. In practice, however, PINNs are frequently trained using experimental or numerical data that are not fully consistent with the governing equations due to measurement noise, discretization errors, or modeling assumptions. The implications of such data-to-PDE inconsistencies on the accuracy and convergence of PINNs remain insufficiently understood. In this work, we systematically analyze how data inconsistency fundamentally limits the attainable accuracy of PINNs. We introduce the concept of a consistency barrier, defined as an intrinsic lower bound on the error that arises from mismatches between the fidelity of the data and the exact enforcement of the PDE residual. To isolate and quantify this effect, we consider the 1D viscous Burgers equation with a manufactured analytical solution, which enables full control over data fidelity and residual errors. PINNs are trained using datasets of progressively increasing numerical accuracy, as well as perfectly consistent analytical data. Results show that while the inclusion of the PDE residual allows PINNs to partially mitigate low-fidelity data and recover the dominant physical structure, the training process ultimately saturates at an error level dictated by the data inconsistency. When high-fidelity numerical data are employed, PINN solutions become indistinguishable from those trained on analytical data, indicating that the consistency barrier is effectively removed. These findings clarify the interplay between data quality and physics enforcement in PINNs providing practical guidance for the construction and interpretation of physics-informed surrogate models.",

Accurate assessment is vital for adaptive learning, clinical monitoring, and brain-computer interfaces. Physiological signals such as pupillometry and electroencephalography are established biomarkers of cognitive load, but their comparative utility and practical integration as lightweight, wearable monitoring solutions remain underexplored. EEG provides high temporal resolution of neural activity. Although non-invasive, it is technologically demanding and limited in wearability and cost due to its resource-intensive nature, whereas pupillometry is non-invasive, portable, and scalable. Existing studies often rely on deep learning models with limited interpretability and substantial computational expense. This study integrates feature-based and model-driven approaches to advance time-series analysis. Using the OpenNeuro 'Digit Span Task' dataset, this study investigates cognitive load classification from EEG and pupillometry. Feature-based approaches using Catch-22 features and classical machine learning models outperform deep learning in both binary and multiclass tasks. The findings demonstrate that pupillometry alone can compete with EEG, serving as a portable and practical proxy for real-world applications. These results challenge the assumption that EEG is necessary for load detection, showing that pupil dynamics combined with interpretable models and SHAP based feature analysis provide physiologically meaningful insights.

Synthetic data produced by generative artificial intelligence (genAI) models trained on real data is often seen as one possible solution to comply with privacy regulations. While powerful genAI models for heterogeneous hospital time series have recently been introduced, such modeling does not guarantee privacy protection, as the generated data may still reveal identifying information about individuals in the models' training cohort. Applying established privacy mechanisms to generative time series models, however, proves challenging as post-hoc data anonymization through k-anonymization or similar techniques is limited, while model-centered privacy mechanisms that implement differential privacy (DP) may lead to unstable training, compromising the utility of generated data. Given these known limitations, privacy audits for generative time series models are currently indispensable regardless of the concrete privacy mechanisms applied to models and/or data. In this work, we use a battery of established privacy attacks to audit state-of-the-art hospital time series models, trained on the public MIMIC-IV dataset, with respect to privacy preservation. Furthermore, the eICU dataset was used to mount a privacy attack against the synthetic data generator trained on the MIMIC-IV dataset. Results show that established privacy attacks are ineffective against generated multivariate clinical time series when synthetic data generators are trained on large enough training datasets. Furthermore, we discuss how the use of existing DP mechanisms for these synthetic data generators would not bring desired improvement in privacy, but only a decrease in utility for machine learning prediction tasks.",

In this work, we propose Coarse-Grained Boltzmann Generators (CG-BGs), a principled framework that unifies scalable reduced-order modeling with the exactness of importance sampling. CG-BGs act in a coarse-grained coordinate space, using a learned potential of mean force (PMF) to reweight samples generated by a flow-based model.

Temporal preservation is influenced by factors such as original data quality, measurement frequency, and preprocessing strategies, including binning, variable encoding and precision. Variables with sparse or highly irregular measurement times provide limited information for learning temporal dependencies, resulting in reduced resemblance between the synthetic and original data. No single metric adequately captures temporal preservation; instead, a multidimensional evaluation across all characteristics provides a more comprehensive assessment of synthetic data quality. Overall, the proposed metrics clarify how and why temporal structures are preserved or degraded, enabling more reliable evaluation and improvement of generative models and supporting the creation of temporally realistic synthetic longitudinal patient data.",

        "abstract": "Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a powerful tool for optimizing complex non-linear systems. However, its performance degrades in high-dimensional problems with tightly coupled parameters and highly asymmetric objective landscapes, where rewards are sparse. In such needle-in-a-haystack scenarios, even advanced methods like trust-region BO (TurBO) often lead to unsatisfactory results. We propose a domain knowledge guided Bayesian Optimization approach, which leverages physical insight to fundamentally simplify the search problem by transforming coordinates to decouple input features and align the active subspaces with the primary search axes. We demonstrate this approach's efficacy on a challenging 12-dimensional, 6-crystal Split-and-Delay optical system, where conventional approaches, including standard BO, TuRBO and multi-objective BO, consistently led to unsatisfactory results. When combined with an reverse annealing exploration strategy, this approach reliably converges to the global optimum. The coordinate transformation itself is the key to this success, significantly accelerating the search by aligning input co-ordinate axes with the problem's active subspaces. As increasingly complex scientific instruments, from large telescopes to new spectrometers at X-ray Free Electron Lasers are deployed, the demand for robust high-dimensional optimization grows. Our results demonstrate a generalizable paradigm: leveraging physical insight to transform high-dimensional, coupled optimization problems into simpler representations can enable rapid and robust automated tuning for consistent high performance while still retaining current optimization algorithms.",

While deep GLAD methods have shown promising performance, their black-box nature limits their reliability and deployment in real-world applications. Although some recent methods have made attempts to provide explanations for anomaly detection results, they either provide explanations without referencing normal graphs, or rely on abstract latent vectors as prototypes rather than concrete graphs from the dataset. To address these limitations, we propose Prototype-based Graph-Level Anomaly Detection (ProtoGLAD), an interpretable unsupervised framework that provides explanation for each detected anomaly by explicitly contrasting with its nearest normal prototype graph. It employs a point-set kernel to iteratively discover multiple normal prototype graphs and their associated clusters from the dataset, then identifying graphs distant from all discovered normal clusters as anomalies. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that ProtoGLAD achieves competitive anomaly detection performance compared to state-of-the-art GLAD methods while providing better human-interpretable prototype-based explanations.",

These challenges include numerical heterogeneity arising from the decoupling of positional embeddings, misalignment of quantization scales in FP8 PV GEMM, and the need for optimized system-level support. In this paper, we introduce SnapMLA, an FP8 MLA decoding framework optimized to improve long-context efficiency through the following hardware-aware algorithm-kernel co-optimization techniques: (i) RoPE-Aware Per-Token KV Quantization, where the RoPE part is maintained in high precision, motivated by our comprehensive analysis of the heterogeneous quantization sensitivity inherent to the MLA KV cache. Furthermore, per-token granularity is employed to align with the autoregressive decoding process and maintain quantization accuracy. (ii) Quantized PV Computation Pipeline Reconstruction, which resolves the misalignment of quantization scale in FP8 PV computation stemming from the shared KV structure of the MLA KV cache. (iii) End-to-End Dataflow Optimization, where we establish an efficient data read-and-write workflow using specialized kernels, ensuring efficient data flow and performance gains. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art MLA LLMs show that SnapMLA achieves up to a 1.91x improvement in throughput, with negligible risk of performance degradation in challenging long-context tasks, including mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks.

For instance, in hyperparameter tuning, the validation accuracy of a model configuration (arm) typically increases with each training epoch. A defining characteristic of RMAB is em horizon-dependent optimality: unlike standard settings, the optimal strategy here shifts dramatically depending on the available budget $T$. This implies that knowledge of $T$ yields significantly greater utility in RMAB, empowering the learner to align its decision-making with this shifting optimality. However, the horizon-aware setting remains underexplored. To address this, we propose a novel CUmulative Reward Estimation UCB (CURE-UCB) that explicitly integrates the horizon. We provide a rigorous analysis establishing a new regret upper bound and prove that our method strictly outperforms horizon-agnostic strategies in structured environments like ``linear-then-flat'' instances.

We address these limitations by reframing sequence modelling through a probabilistic lens, using Bayesian filters as a core primitive. While classical filters such as Kalman filters provide principled state estimation and uncertainty tracking, they are typically viewed as inherently sequential. We show that reparameterising the Kalman filter in information form enables its updates to be computed via an associative scan, allowing efficient parallel training. Building on this insight, we introduce the Kalman Linear Attention (KLA) layer, a neural sequence-modelling primitive that performs time-parallel probabilistic inference while maintaining explicit belief-state uncertainty. KLA offers strictly more expressive nonlinear updates and gating than GLA variants while retaining their computational advantages. On language modelling tasks, KLA matches or outperforms modern SSMs and GLAs across representative discrete token-manipulation and state-tracking benchmarks.",

For example, the number of up-votes on social media posts, or the number of bicycles available at a public rental station. While it is possible to model these as continuous values, and to apply traditional regression, this approach changes the underlying distribution on the labels from discrete to continuous. Discrete distributions have certain benefits, which leads us to the question whether such integer labels can be modeled directly by a discrete distribution, whose parameters are predicted from the features of a given instance. Moreover, we focus on the use case of output distributions of neural networks, which adds the requirement that the parameters of the distribution be continuous so that backpropagation and gradient descent may be used to learn the weights of the network. We investigate several options for such distributions, some existing and some novel, and test them on a range of tasks, including tabular learning, sequential prediction and image generation. We find that overall the best performance comes from two distributions: Bitwise, which represents the target integer in bits and places a Bernoulli distribution on each, and a discrete analogue of the Laplace distribution, which uses a distribution with exponentially decaying tails around a continuous mean.",

We introduce $(t,K)$-threshold watermarking: clients collaboratively embed a shared watermark during training, while only coalitions of at least $t$ clients can reconstruct the watermark key and verify a suspect model. We secret-share the watermark key $\\tau$ so that coalitions of fewer than $t$ clients cannot reconstruct it, and verification can be performed without revealing $\\tau$ in the clear. We instantiate our protocol in the white-box setting and evaluate on image classification. Our watermark remains detectable at scale ($K=128$) with minimal accuracy loss and stays above the detection threshold ($z\\ge 4$) under attacks including adaptive fine-tuning using up to 20% of the training data.",

A well-known vulnerability is a backdoor introduced into a neural network by poisoned training data or a malicious training process. Backdoors can be used to induce unwanted behavior by including a certain trigger in the input. Existing mitigations filter training data, modify the model, or perform expensive input modifications on samples. If a vulnerable model has already been deployed, however, those strategies are either ineffective or inefficient. To address this gap, we propose our inference-time backdoor mitigation approach called FIRE (Feature-space Inference-time REpair). We hypothesize that a trigger induces structured and repeatable changes in the model's internal representation. We view the trigger as directions in the latent spaces between layers that can be applied in reverse to correct the inference mechanism. Therefore, we turn the backdoored model against itself by manipulating its latent representations and moving a poisoned sample's features along the backdoor directions to neutralize the trigger. Our evaluation shows that FIRE has low computational overhead and outperforms current runtime mitigations on image benchmarks across various attacks, datasets, and network architectures.",

Existing efficient architectures are theoretically bounded by shallow, single-step linear updates, while powerful iterative methods like Test-Time Training (TTT) break hardware parallelism due to state-dependent gradients. We propose PRISM (Parallel Residual Iterative Sequence Model) to resolve this tension. PRISM introduces a solver-inspired inductive bias that captures key structural properties of multi-step refinement in a parallelizable form. We employ a Write-Forget Decoupling strategy that isolates non-linearity within the injection operator. To bypass the serial dependency of explicit solvers, PRISM utilizes a two-stage proxy architecture: a short-convolution anchors the initial residual using local history energy, while a learned predictor estimates the refinement updates directly from the input. This design distills structural patterns associated with iterative correction into a parallelizable feedforward operator. Theoretically, we prove that this formulation achieves Rank-$L$ accumulation, structurally expanding the update manifold beyond the single-step Rank-$1$ bottleneck. Empirically, it achieves comparable performance to explicit optimization methods while achieving 174x higher throughput.",

        "abstract": "Aligning large language models (LLMs) on domain-specific data remains a fundamental challenge. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) offers a straightforward way to inject domain knowledge but often degrades the model's generality. In contrast, on-policy reinforcement learning (RL) preserves generality but fails to effectively assimilate hard samples that exceed the model's current reasoning level. Recent off-policy RL attempts improve hard sample utilization, yet they suffer from severe training instability due to the forced distribution shift toward off-policy knowledge. To reconcile effective off-policy knowledge absorption with the stability of on-policy RL, we propose Rephrasing Policy Optimization (RePO). In RePO, the policy model is prompted to first comprehend off-policy knowledge and then rephrase it into trajectories that conform to its own stylistic and parametric distribution. RePO dynamically replaces low-reward rollouts with these rephrased, high-quality trajectories. This strategy guides the model toward correct reasoning paths while strictly preserving on-policy training dynamics.

Various methods address this issue by optimizing a weighted objective that focuses on the worst-performing groups. However, this approach becomes problematic when learning with differential privacy, as unequal data weighting can result in inhomogeneous privacy guarantees, in particular weaker privacy for minority groups. In this work, we introduce a new algorithm for differentially private worst-case group optimization called ASC (Adaptively Sampled and Clipped Worst-case Group Optimization). It adaptively controls both the sampling rate and the clipping threshold of each group. Thereby, it allows for harder-to-learn groups to be sampled more often while ensuring consistent privacy guarantees across all groups. Comparing ASC to prior work, we show that it results in lower-variance gradients, tighter privacy guarantees, and substantially higher worst-case group accuracy without sacrificing overall average accuracy.",

This limitation prevents them from effectively capturing global periodic patterns that often span cycles significantly longer than the input horizon - despite such patterns carrying strong predictive signals. Naive solutions, such as extending the historical window, lead to severe drawbacks, including overfitting, prohibitive computational costs, and redundant information processing. To address these challenges, we introduce the Global Temporal Retriever (GTR), a lightweight and plug-and-play module designed to extend any forecasting model's temporal awareness beyond the immediate historical context. GTR maintains an adaptive global temporal embedding of the entire cycle and dynamically retrieves and aligns relevant global segments with the input sequence. By jointly modeling local and global dependencies through a 2D convolution and residual fusion, GTR effectively bridges short-term observations with long-term periodicity without altering the host model architecture. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate that GTR consistently delivers state-of-the-art performance across both short-term and long-term forecasting scenarios, while incurring minimal parameter and computational overhead. These results highlight GTR as an efficient and general solution for enhancing global periodicity modeling in MTSF tasks. Code is available at this repository: this https URL.",

This design enables a parallel optimize-and-approximate framework in which the Hessian-inverse approximation is updated synchronously with the stochastic inner optimization, reusing gradient information at negligible additional cost. Our main theoretical contribution establishes high-probability error bounds and sample complexity guarantees for NHGD that match those of state-of-the-art optimize-then-approximate methods, while significantly reducing computational time overhead. Empirical evaluations on representative bilevel learning tasks further demonstrate the practical advantages of NHGD, highlighting its scalability and effectiveness in large-scale machine learning settings.",

A practical alternative to reduce computational and memory overhead is to perform BPTT repeatedly over shorter segments of the training data set, corresponding to truncated BPTT. In this paper, we examine the training of RNNs when using such a truncated learning approach for time series tasks. Specifically, we establish theoretical bounds on the accuracy and performance loss when optimizing over subsequences instead of the full data sequence. This reveals that the burn-in phase of the RNN is an important tuning knob in its training, with significant impact on the performance guarantees. We validate our theoretical results through experiments on standard benchmarks from the fields of system identification and time series forecasting. In all experiments, we observe a strong influence of the burn-in phase on the training process, and proper tuning can lead to a reduction of the prediction error on the training and test data of more than 60% in some cases.",

To address these limitations, we propose the Flexible safety Domain Optimization via Margin-regularized Exploration (FlexDOME) algorithm, the first to provably achieve near-constant $\\tilde{O}(1)$ strong constraint violation alongside sublinear strong regret and non-asymptotic last-iterate convergence. FlexDOME incorporates time-varying safety margins and regularization terms into the primal-dual framework. Our theoretical analysis relies on a novel term-wise asymptotic dominance strategy, where the safety margin is rigorously scheduled to asymptotically majorize the functional decay rates of the optimization and statistical errors, thereby clamping cumulative violations to a near-constant level. Furthermore, we establish non-asymptotic last-iterate convergence guarantees via a policy-dual Lyapunov argument. Experiments corroborate our theoretical findings.",

Rather than combining probability densities, we treat pre-trained diffusion models as interacting agents whose diffusion trajectories are jointly steered, via optimal control, toward a shared objective defined on their aggregated output.

To address these challenges, we introduce MoEEdit, the first routing-stable framework for parameter-modifying knowledge editing in MoE LLMs. Our method reparameterizes expert updates via per-expert null-space projections that keep router inputs invariant and thereby suppress routing shifts. The resulting block-structured optimization is solved efficiently with a block coordinate descent (BCD) solver. Experiments show that MoEEdit attains state-of-the-art efficacy and generalization while preserving high specificity and routing stability, with superior compute and memory efficiency.

We propose HCW-GLB-OMD, which consists of two components: an online mirror descent (OMD)-based estimator and Hessian-based confidence weights to achieve corruption robustness. This is computationally efficient in that it only requires ${O}(1)$ space and time complexity per iteration. Under the self-concordance assumption on the link function, we show a regret bound of $\\tilde{O}\\left( d \\sqrt{\\sum_t g(\\tau_t) \\dot{\\mu}_{t,\\star}} + d^2 g_{\\max} \\kappa + d \\kappa C \\right)$, where $\\dot{\\mu}_{t,\\star}$ is the slope of $\\mu$ around the optimal arm at time $t$, $g(\\tau_t)$'s are potentially exogenously time-varying dispersions (e.g., $g(\\tau_t) = \\sigma_t^2$ for heteroskedastic linear bandits, $g(\\tau_t) = 1$ for Bernoulli and Poisson), $g_{\\max} = \\max_{t \\in [T]} g(\\tau_t)$ is the maximum dispersion, and $C \\geq 0$ is the total corruption budget of the adversary. We complement this with a lower bound of $\\tilde{\\Omega}(d \\sqrt{\\sum_t g(\\tau_t) \\dot{\\mu}_{t,\\star}} + d C)$, unifying previous problem-specific lower bounds. Thus, our algorithm achieves, up to a $\\kappa$-factor in the corruption term, instance-wise minimax optimality simultaneously across various instances of heteroskedastic GLBs with adversarial corruptions.",

However, such candidates are rare and expensive to evaluate, yielding sample efficiency essential. Additionally, surrogate models introduced to predict molecule evaluations, suffer from distribution shift as optimization drives candidates increasingly out-of-distribution. To address these challenges, we introduce Joint Self-Improvement, which benefits from (i) a joint generative-predictive model and (ii) a self-improving sampling scheme. The former aligns the generator with the surrogate, alleviating distribution shift, while the latter biases the generative part of the joint model using the predictive one to efficiently generate optimized molecules at inference-time.

We present TVCACHE, a stateful tool-value cache for LLM agent post-training.

TVCACHE achieves cache hit rates of up to 70% and reduces median tool call execution time by up to 6.9X, with no degradation in post-training reward accumulation.",

Operating under a global compression budget, ROCKET comprises two key innovations: First, it formulates layer-wise compression allocation as a multi-choice knapsack problem, selecting the optimal compression level for each layer to minimize total reconstruction error while adhering to a target model size. Second, it introduces a single-step sparse matrix factorization inspired by dictionary learning: using only a small calibration set, it sparsifies weight coefficients based on activation-weights sensitivity and then updates the dictionary in closed form via least squares bypassing iterative optimization, sparse coding, or backpropagation entirely. ROCKET consistently outperforms existing compression approaches across different model architectures at 20-50\\% compression rates. Notably, it retains over 90\\% of the original model's performance at 30\\% compression without any fine-tuning. Moreover, when applying a light fine-tuning phase, recovery is substantially enhanced: for instance, compressing Qwen3-14B to an 8B-parameter model and healing it with just 30 million tokens yields performance nearly on par with the original Qwen3-8B.

On Shanghai Gold Exchange (SGE) spot gold data (2005-2025), we construct two window-aligned views from each rolling window: an OHLCV-rendered price/volume chart and a technical-indicator matrix. To ensure reliable evaluation, we adopt leakage-resistant time-block splits with embargo and use Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC). We find that results depend strongly on the label-noise regime: we apply an ex-post minimum-movement filter that discards samples with realized next-day absolute return below tau to define evaluation subsets with reduced near-zero label ambiguity. This induces a non-monotonic data-noise trade-off that can reveal predictive signal but eventually increases variance as sample size shrinks; the filter is used for offline benchmark construction rather than an inference-time decision rule. In the stabilized subsets, fusion is regime dependent: early fusion by channel stacking can exhibit negative transfer, whereas late fusion with dual encoders and a fusion head provides the dominant clean-performance gains; cross-view consistency regularization has secondary, backbone-dependent effects. We further evaluate test-time L-infinity perturbations using FGSM and PGD under two threat scenarios: view-constrained attacks that perturb one view and joint attacks that perturb both. We observe severe vulnerability at tiny budgets with strong view asymmetry. Late fusion consistently improves robustness under view-constrained attacks, but joint attacks remain challenging and can still cause substantial worst-case degradation.",

These documents are heterogeneous collections such as emails, legal texts, and spreadsheets compiled into single PDFs, where semantic ordering signals are unreliable. We compare five methods, including pointer networks, seq2seq transformers, and specialized pairwise ranking models. The best performing approach successfully reorders documents up to 15 pages, with Kendall's tau ranging from 0.95 for short documents (2-5 pages) to 0.72 for 15 page documents. We observe two unexpected failures: seq2seq transformers fail to generalize on long documents (Kendall's tau drops from 0.918 on 2-5 pages to 0.014 on 21-25 pages), and curriculum learning underperforms direct training by 39% on long documents. Ablation studies suggest learned positional encodings are one contributing factor to seq2seq failure, though the degradation persists across all encoding variants, indicating multiple interacting causes. Attention pattern analysis reveals that short and long documents require fundamentally different ordering strategies, explaining why curriculum learning fails. Model specialization achieves substantial improvements on longer documents (+0.21 tau).",

In this paper, we present Pram, the first ML-based method that leverages the reasoning power of multimodal language models (MLMs) for addressing the trade-off dilemma -- a great need of service providers. As part of our proposal, Pram (i) quickly computes high-quality allocations by dividing the original problem into local subproblems, which are then resolved by an MLM-powered \"agent\", and (ii) ensures global consistency by harmonizing these subproblems via a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm. Theoretically, we show that Pram, which learns to perform gradient descent in context, provably converges to the optimum within the family of MCF problems. Empirically, on real-world datasets and public topologies, Pram achieves performance comparable to, and in some cases even surpassing, linear programming solvers (very close to the optimal solution), and substantially lower runtimes (1 to 2 orders of magnitude faster). Moreover, Pram exhibits strong robustness (<10\\% performance degradation under link failures or flow bursts), demonstrating MLM's generalization ability to unforeseen events. Pram is objective-agnostic and seamlessly integrates with mainstream allocation systems, providing a practical and scalable solution for future networks.",

While multimodal content offers a promising solution, existing methods result in suboptimal representations for new items due to noise and entanglement in sparse data. To address this, we transform multimodal recommendation into discrete semantic tokenization. We present Sparse-Regularized Multimodal Tokenization for Cold-Start Recommendation (MoToRec), a framework centered on a sparsely-regularized Residual Quantized Variational Autoencoder (RQ-VAE) that generates a compositional semantic code of discrete, interpretable tokens, promoting disentangled representations. MoToRec's architecture is enhanced by three synergistic components: (1) a sparsely-regularized RQ-VAE that promotes disentangled representations, (2) a novel adaptive rarity amplification that promotes prioritized learning for cold-start items, and (3) a hierarchical multi-source graph encoder for robust signal fusion with collaborative signals. Extensive experiments on three large-scale datasets demonstrate MoToRec's superiority over state-of-the-art methods in both overall and cold-start scenarios. Our work validates that discrete tokenization provides an effective and scalable alternative for mitigating the long-standing cold-start challenge.",

Our approach hinges on specific inputs we call Border Inputs, for which there exists more than one output top token. From a statistical perspective, optimal change detection depends on the model's Jacobian and the Fisher information of the output distribution. Analyzing these quantities in low-temperature regimes shows that border inputs enable powerful change detection tests. Building on this insight, we propose the Black-Box Border Input Tracking (B3IT) scheme. Extensive in-vivo and in-vitro experiments show that border inputs are easily found for non-reasoning tested endpoints, and achieve performance on par with the best available grey-box approaches.

However, practical offline datasets often contain examples with little diversity or limited exploration of the environment, and from multiple behavior policies with diverse expertise levels. Limited exploration can impair the offline RL algorithm's ability to estimate \\textit{Q} or \\textit{V} values, while constraining towards diverse behavior policies can be overly conservative. Such datasets call for a balance between the RL objective and behavior policy constraints. We first identify the connection between $f$-divergence and optimization constraint on the Bellman residual through a more general Linear Programming form for RL and the convex conjugate. Following this, we introduce the general flexible function formulation for the $f$-divergence to incorporate an adaptive constraint on algorithms' learning objectives based on the offline training dataset. Results from experiments on the MuJoCo, Fetch, and AdroitHand environments show the correctness of the proposed LP form and the potential of the flexible $f$-divergence in improving performance for learning from a challenging dataset when applied to a compatible constrained optimization algorithm.",

As an initial contribution, we reproduce eighteen state of the art photonic and hybrid QML works spanning kernel methods, reservoir computing, convolutional and recurrent architectures, generative models, and modern training paradigms. These reproductions are released as reusable, modular experiments that can be directly extended and adapted, establishing a shared experimental baseline consistent with empirical benchmarking methodologies widely adopted in modern artificial intelligence. By embedding photonic quantum models within established machine learning ecosystems, MerLin allows practitioners to leverage existing tooling for ablation studies, cross modality comparisons, and hybrid classical quantum workflows.

Specifically, we restrict ourselves to parameterizations with hard initial and boundary condition constraints and reformulate the problem of estimating PINN parameters as a statistical learning problem. From this perspective, the physics penalty on the IBVP residuals can be better understood not as a regularizing term bus as an infinite source of indirect data, and the learning process as fitting the PINN distribution of residuals $p(y \\mid x, t, w) q(x, t) $ to the true data-generating distribution $\\delta(0) q(x, t)$ by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the true and PINN distributions. Furthermore, this analysis show that physics-informed learning with PINNs is a singular learning problem, and we employ singular learning theory tools, namely the so-called Local Learning Coefficient (Lau et al., 2025) to analyze the estimates of PINN parameters obtained via stochastic optimization for a heat equation IBVP. Finally, we discuss implications of this analysis on the quantification of predictive uncertainty of PINNs and the extrapolation capacity of PINNs.",

Here we introduce the Materials Knowledge Navigation Agent (MKNA), a language-driven system that translates natural-language scientific intent into executable actions for database retrieval, property prediction, structure generation, and stability evaluation. Beyond automating tool invocation, MKNA autonomously extracts quantitative thresholds and chemically meaningful design motifs from literature and database evidence, enabling data-grounded hypothesis formation. Applied to the search for high-Debye-temperature ceramics, the agent identifies a literature-supported screening criterion (Theta_D > 800 K), rediscovers canonical ultra-stiff materials such as diamond, SiC, SiN, and BeO, and proposes thermodynamically stable, previously unreported Be-C-rich compounds that populate the sparsely explored 1500-1700 K regime. These results demonstrate that MKNA not only finds stable candidates but also reconstructs interpretable design heuristics, establishing a generalizable platform for autonomous, language-guided materials exploration.",

Recent generative approaches, including diffusion models, show strong performance under hypervolume, yet their behavior under other established MOO metrics is less understood. We show that generative methods systematically underperform evolutionary alternatives with respect to other metrics, such as generational distance. We relate this failure mode to the offline-frontier shift, i.e., the displacement of the offline dataset from the Pareto front, which acts as a fundamental limitation in offline MOO. We argue that overcoming this limitation requires out-of-distribution sampling in objective space (via an integral probability metric) and empirically observe that generative methods remain conservatively close to the offline objective distribution. Our results position offline MOO as a distribution-shift--limited problem and provide a diagnostic lens for understanding when and why generative optimization methods fail.",

Policy optimization algorithms generate a number of responses for a given prompt and then effectively weight the corresponding gradients depending on the rewards. The most popular algorithms including GRPO, DAPO, and RLOO focus on ambiguous prompts, i.e., prompts with intermediate success probability, while downgrading gradients with very easy and very hard prompts. In this paper, we consider asymmetric prompt weightings that assign higher weights to prompts with low, or even zero, empirical success probability. We find that asymmetric weighting particularly benefits from-scratch RL (as in R1-Zero), where training traverses a wide accuracy range, and less so in post-SFT RL where the model already starts at high accuracy. We also provide theory that characterizes prompt weights which minimize the time needed to raise success probability from an initial level to a target accuracy under a fixed update budget. In low-success regimes, where informative responses are rare and response cost dominates, these optimal weights become asymmetric, upweighting low success probabilities and thereby accelerating effective-time convergence.",

Doing it on edge hardware improves privacy and lowers latency, but entails memory constraints. To address this, we propose Error-enhanced Contrastive Handwriting Recognition (ECHWR), a training framework designed to improve feature representation and recognition accuracy without increasing inference costs. ECHWR utilizes a temporary auxiliary branch that aligns sensor signals with semantic text embeddings during the training phase. This alignment is maintained through a dual contrastive objective: an in-batch contrastive loss for general modality alignment and a novel error-based contrastive loss that distinguishes between correct signals and synthetic hard negatives. The auxiliary branch is discarded after training, which allows the deployed model to keep its original, efficient architecture. Evaluations on the OnHW-Words500 dataset show that ECHWR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, reducing character error rates by up to 7.4% on the writer-independent split and 10.4% on the writer-dependent split. Finally, although our ablation studies indicate that solving specific challenges require specific architectural and objective configurations, error-based contrastive loss shows its effectiveness for handling unseen writing styles.",

Optimization approaches include theoretically lossless methods and others without accuracy guarantees like quantization. In all of these cases it is crucial to ensure that the model quality has not degraded. However, even at temperature zero, model generations are not necessarily robust even to theoretically lossless model optimizations due to numerical errors. We thus require statistical tools to decide whether a finite-sample accuracy deviation is an evidence of a model's degradation or whether it can be attributed to (harmless) noise in the evaluation. We propose a statistically sound hypothesis testing framework based on McNemar's test allowing to efficiently detect model degradations, while guaranteeing a controlled rate of false positives. The crucial insight is that we have to confront the model scores on each sample, rather than aggregated on the task level. Furthermore, we propose three approaches to aggregate accuracy estimates across multiple benchmarks into a single decision. We provide an implementation on top of the largely adopted open source LM Evaluation Harness and provide a case study illustrating that the method correctly flags degraded models, while not flagging model optimizations that are provably lossless. We find that with our tests even empirical accuracy degradations of 0.3% can be confidently attributed to actual degradations rather than noise.",

Perturbations targeting the same gene can produce different transcriptional responses depending on their genomic locus, including different transcription start sites and regulatory elements. Gene-level perturbation models collapse these distinct interventions into the same representation. We introduce STRAND, a generative model that predicts single-cell transcriptional responses by conditioning on regulatory DNA sequence. STRAND represents a perturbation by encoding the sequence at its genomic locus and uses this representation to parameterize a conditional transport process from control to perturbed cell states. Representing perturbations by sequence, rather than by a fixed set of gene identifiers, supports zero-shot inference at loci not seen during training and expands inference-time genomic coverage from ~1.5% for gene-level single-cell foundation models to ~95% of the genome. We evaluate STRAND on CRISPR perturbation datasets in K562, Jurkat, and RPE1 cells. STRAND improves discrimination scores by up to 33% in low-sample regimes, achieves the best average rank on unseen gene perturbation benchmarks, and improves transfer to novel cell lines by up to 0.14 in Pearson correlation. Ablations isolate the gains to sequence conditioning and transport, and case studies show that STRAND resolves functionally alternative transcription start sites missed by gene-level models.",

        "abstract": "The effective application of foundation models to translational research in immune-mediated diseases requires multimodal patient-level representations that can capture complex phenotypes emerging from multicellular interactions. Yet most current biological foundation models focus only on single-cell resolution and are evaluated on technical metrics often disconnected from actual drug development tasks and challenges. Here, we introduce EVA, the first cross-species, multimodal foundation model of immunology and inflammation, a therapeutic area where shared pathogenic mechanisms create unique opportunities for transfer learning. EVA harmonizes transcriptomics data across species, platforms, and resolutions, and integrates histology data to produce rich, unified patient representations. We establish clear scaling laws, demonstrating that increasing model size and compute translates to improvements in both pretraining and downstream tasks performance. We introduce a comprehensive evaluation suite of 39 tasks spanning the drug development pipeline: zero-shot target efficacy and gene function prediction for discovery, cross-species or cross-diseases molecular perturbations for preclinical development, and patient stratification with treatment response prediction or disease activity prediction for clinical trials applications. We benchmark EVA against several state-of-the-art biological foundation models and baselines on these tasks, and demonstrate state-of-the-art results on each task category. Using mechanistic interpretability, we further identify biological meaningful features, revealing intertwined representations across species and technologies. We release an open version of EVA for transcriptomics to accelerate research on immune-mediated diseases.",

This shift is defined by a so-called distribution map. In the half-decade since, a literature has emerged which has, among other things, introduced new solution concepts to the original setup, extended the setup, offered new theoretical analyses, and examined the intersection of performative prediction and other established fields. In this survey, we first lay out the performative prediction setting and explain the different optimization targets: performative stability and performative optimality. We introduce a new way of classifying different performative prediction settings, based on how much information is available about the distribution map. We survey existing implementations of distribution maps and existing methods to address the problem of performative prediction, while examining different ways to categorize them. Finally, we point out known and previously unknown connections that can be drawn to other fields, in the hopes of stimulating future research.",

Prior efforts follow two largely independent paths: (i) training domain-adapted RTL models to internalize hardware semantics, (ii) developing agentic systems that leverage frontier generic LLMs guided by simulation feedback. However, these two paths exhibit complementary strengths and weaknesses. In this work, we present ACE-RTL that unifies both directions through Agentic Context Evolution (ACE). ACE-RTL integrates an RTL-specialized LLM, trained on a large-scale dataset of 1.7 million RTL samples, with a frontier reasoning LLM through three synergistic components: the generator, reflector, and coordinator. These components iteratively refine RTL code toward functional correctness. We further introduce a parallel scaling strategy that significantly reduces the number of iterations required to reach correct solutions. On the Comprehensive Verilog Design Problems (CVDP) benchmark, ACE-RTL achieves up to a 44.87% pass rate improvement over 14 competitive baselines while requiring only four iterations on average.",

Existing eviction or compression methods reduce cost but rely on heuristics, such as recency or past attention scores, which serve only as indirect proxies for a token's future utility and introduce computational overhead. We reframe KV cache eviction as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem: learning to rank tokens by their predicted usefulness for future decoding. To this end, we introduce KV Policy (KVP), a framework of lightweight per-head RL agents trained on pre-computed generation traces using only key and value vectors. Each agent learns a specialized eviction policy guided by future utility, which evaluates the quality of the ranking across all cache budgets, requiring no modifications to the underlying LLM or additional inference. Evaluated across two different model families on the long-context benchmark RULER and the multi-turn dialogue benchmark OASST2-4k, KVP significantly outperforms baselines. Furthermore, zero-shot tests on standard downstream tasks (e.g., LongBench, BOOLQ, ARC) indicate that KVP generalizes well beyond its training distribution and to longer context lengths. These results demonstrate that learning to predict future token utility is a powerful and scalable paradigm for adaptive KV cache management.",

A natural formalization is the sequence-level power distribution $\\pi_\\alpha(y\\mid x)\\propto p_\\theta(y\\mid x)^\\alpha$ ($\\alpha>1$), which concentrates mass on whole sequences instead of adjusting token-level temperature. Prior work shows that Metropolis--Hastings (MH) sampling from this distribution recovers strong reasoning performance, but at order-of-magnitude inference slowdowns. We introduce Power-SMC, a training-free Sequential Monte Carlo scheme that targets the same objective while remaining close to standard decoding latency. Power-SMC advances a small particle set in parallel, corrects importance weights token-by-token, and resamples when necessary, all within a single GPU-friendly batched decode. We prove that temperature $\\tau=1/\\alpha$ is the unique prefix-only proposal minimizing incremental weight variance, interpret residual instability via prefix-conditioned Rényi entropies, and introduce an exponent-bridging schedule that improves particle stability without altering the target. On MATH500, Power-SMC matches or exceeds MH power sampling while reducing latency from $16$--$28\\times$ to $1.4$--$3.3\\times$ over baseline decoding.",

Recently, inference-time scaling has emerged as a powerful paradigm to improve the reasoning performance of Large Language Models by expanding test-time computation. Specifically, instruction-tuned (IT) models explicitly generate long reasoning steps during inference, whereas Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are trained by reinforcement learning to discover reasoning paths that maximize accuracy. However, it remains unclear whether resource-rationality can emerge from such scaling without explicit reward related to computational costs. We introduce a Variable Attribution Task in which models infer which variables determine outcomes given candidate variables, input-output trials, and predefined logical functions. By varying the number of candidate variables and trials, we systematically manipulate task complexity. Both models exhibit a transition from brute-force to analytic strategies as complexity increases. IT models degrade on XOR and XNOR functions, whereas LRMs remain robust. These findings suggest that models can adjust their reasoning behavior in response to task complexity, even without explicit cost-based reward. It provides compelling evidence that resource rationality is an emergent property of inference-time scaling itself.",

Aims: We present a fast, unsupervised methodology to reduce stellar contamination and instrument-specific noise in exoplanet transmission spectra using denoising autoencoders, improving the reliability of retrieved atmospheric parameters. Methods: We design and train denoising autoencoder architectures on large synthetic datasets of terrestrial (TRAPPIST-1e analogues) and sub-Neptune (K2-18b analogues) planets. Reconstruction quality is evaluated with the $\\chi^2$ statistic over a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios, and atmospheric retrieval experiments on contaminated spectra are used to compare against standard correction approaches in accuracy and computational cost. Results: The autoencoders reconstruct uncontaminated spectra while preserving key molecular features, even at low S/N. In retrieval tests, pre-processing with denoising autoencoders reduces bias in inferred abundances relative to uncorrected baselines and matches the accuracy of simultaneous stellar-contamination fitting while reducing computational time by a factor of three to six. Conclusions: Denoising autoencoders provide an efficient alternative to conventional correction strategies and are promising components of future atmospheric characterization pipelines for both rocky and gaseous exoplanets.",

Existing truncation-based samplers are effective but largely heuristic, relying mainly on probability mass and entropy while ignoring semantic geometry of the token space. We present Top-W, a geometry-aware truncation rule that uses Wasserstein distance-defined over token-embedding geometry-to keep the cropped distribution close to the original, while explicitly balancing retained probability mass against the entropy of the kept set. Our theory yields a simple closed-form structure for the fixed-potential subset update: depending on the mass-entropy trade-off, the optimal crop either collapses to a single token or takes the form of a one-dimensional prefix that can be found efficiently with a linear scan. We implement Top-W using efficient geometry-based potentials (nearest-set or k-NN) and pair it with an alternating decoding routine that keeps the standard truncation-and-sampling interface unchanged. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks (GSM8K, GPQA, AlpacaEval, and MT-Bench) across three instruction-tuned models show that Top-W consistently outperforms prior state-of-the-art decoding approaches achieving up to 33.7% improvement. Moreover, we find that Top-W not only improves accuracy-focused performance, but also boosts creativity under judge-based open-ended evaluation.",

Using 12.1 million samples across the Continental United States (2017--2023), we first present a comprehensive interpretability analysis of Google AlphaEarth's 64-dimensional embeddings against 26 environmental variables spanning climate, vegetation, hydrology, temperature, and terrain. Combining linear, nonlinear, and attention-based methods, we show that individual embedding dimensions map onto specific land surface properties, while the full embedding space reconstructs most environmental variables with high fidelity (12 of 26 variables exceed $R^2 > 0.90$; temperature and elevation approach $R^2 = 0.97$). The strongest dimension-variable relationships converge across all three analytical methods and remain robust under spatial block cross-validation (mean $\\Delta R^2 = 0.017$) and temporally stable across all seven study years (mean inter-year correlation $r = 0.963$). Building on these validated interpretations, we then developed a Land Surface Intelligence system that implements retrieval-augmented generation over a FAISS-indexed embedding database of 12.1 million vectors, translating natural language environmental queries into satellite-grounded assessments. An LLM-as-Judge evaluation across 360 query--response cycles, using four LLMs in rotating generator, system, and judge roles, achieved weighted scores of $\\mu = 3.74 \\pm 0.77$ (scale 1--5), with grounding ($\\mu = 3.93$) and coherence ($\\mu = 4.25$) as the strongest criteria.

In this paper, we propose a representation learning approach that constructs instrumental representations from observed covariates, which enable IV-based estimation even in the absence of an explicit instrument. Our model (ZNet) achieves this through an architecture that mirrors the structural causal model of IVs; it decomposes the ambient feature space into confounding and instrumental components, and is trained by enforcing empirical moment conditions corresponding to the defining properties of valid instruments (i.e., relevance, exclusion restriction, and instrumental unconfoundedness). Importantly, ZNet is compatible with a wide range of downstream two-stage IV estimators of causal effects. Our experiments demonstrate that ZNet can (i) recover ground-truth instruments when they already exist in the ambient feature space and (ii) construct latent instruments in the embedding space when no explicit IVs are available. This suggests that ZNet can be used as a ``plug-and-play'' module for causal inference in general observational settings, regardless of whether the (untestable) assumption of unconfoundedness is satisfied.",

This extended study introduces a comprehensive, multimodal physiological framework for non-invasive hypoglycemia detection using wearable sensor signals. Unlike prior work limited to single-signal analysis, this chapter evaluates three physiological modalities, galvanic skin response (GSR), heart rate (HR), and their combined fusion, using the OhioT1DM 2018 dataset. We develop an end-to-end pipeline that integrates advanced preprocessing, temporal windowing, handcrafted and sequence-based feature extraction, early and late fusion strategies, and a broad spectrum of machine learning and deep temporal models, including CNNs, LSTMs, GRUs, and TCNs. Our results demonstrate that physiological signals exhibit distinct autonomic patterns preceding hypoglycemia and that combining GSR with HR consistently enhances detection sensitivity and stability compared to single-signal models. Multimodal deep learning architectures achieve the most reliable performance, particularly in recall, the most clinically urgent metric. Ablation studies further highlight the complementary contributions of each modality, strengthening the case for affordable, sensor-based glycemic monitoring. The findings show that real-time hypoglycemia detection is achievable using only inexpensive, non-invasive wearable sensors, offering a pathway toward accessible glucose monitoring in underserved communities and low-resource healthcare environments.",

        "abstract": "Generative Recommendation (GR) has excelled by framing recommendation as next-token prediction. This paradigm relies on Semantic IDs (SIDs) to tokenize large-scale items into discrete sequences. Existing GR approaches predominantly generate SIDs via Residual Quantization (RQ), where items are encoded into embeddings and then quantized to discrete SIDs. However, this paradigm suffers from inherent limitations: 1) Objective misalignment and semantic degradation stemming from the two-stage compression; 2) Error accumulation inherent in the structure of RQ. To address these limitations, we propose UniSID, a Unified SID generation framework for generative advertisement recommendation. Specifically, we jointly optimize embeddings and SIDs in an end-to-end manner from raw advertising data, enabling semantic information to flow directly into the SID space and thus addressing the inherent limitations of the two-stage cascading compression paradigm. To capture fine-grained semantics, a multi-granularity contrastive learning strategy is introduced to align distinct items across SID levels. Finally, a summary-based ad reconstruction mechanism is proposed to encourage SIDs to capture high-level semantic information that is not explicitly present in advertising contexts. Experiments demonstrate that UniSID consistently outperforms state-of-the-art SID generation methods, yielding up to a 4.62% improvement in Hit Rate metrics across downstream advertising scenarios compared to the strongest baseline.",

Most prior work assumes a separability condition: the global objective and coupled constraint functions are sums of local costs and individual constraints. In contrast, we study a group of agents, networked via a communication graph, that collectively select actions to minimize a sequence of nonseparable global cost functions and to stratify nonseparable long-term constraints based on full-information feedback and intra-agent communication. We propose a distributed online primal-dual belief consensus algorithm, where each agent maintains and updates a local belief of the global collective decisions, which are repeatedly exchanged with neighboring agents. Unlike the previous consensus primal-dual algorithms under separability that ask agents to only communicate their local decisions, our belief-sharing protocol eliminates coupling between the primal consensus disagreement and the dual constraint violation, yielding sublinear regret and cumulative constraint violation (CCV) bounds, both in $O({T}^{1/2})$, where $T$ denotes the time horizon. Such a result breaks the long-standing $O(T^{3/4})$ barrier for CCV and matches the lower bound of online constrained convex optimization, indicating the online learning efficiency at the cost of communication overhead.",

        "abstract": "Driven by scaling laws, recommender systems increasingly rely on large-scale models to capture complex feature interactions and user behaviors, but this trend also leads to prohibitive training and inference costs. While long-sequence models(e.g., LONGER) can reuse user-side computation through KV caching, such reuse is difficult in dense feature interaction architectures(e.g., RankMixer), where user and group (candidate item) features are deeply entangled across layers. In this work, we propose User-Group Separation (UG-Sep), a novel framework that enables reusable user-side computation in dense interaction models for the first time. UG-Sep introduces a masking mechanism that explicitly disentangles user-side and item-side information flows within token-mixing layers, ensuring that a subset of tokens to preserve purely user-side representations across layers. This design enables corresponding token computations to be reused across multiple samples, significantly reducing redundant inference cost. To compensate for potential expressiveness loss induced by masking, we further propose an Information Compensation strategy that adaptively reconstructs suppressed user-item interactions. Moreover, as UG-Sep substantially reduces user-side FLOPs and exposes memory-bound components, we incorporate W8A16 (8-bit weight, 16-bit activation) weight-only quantization to alleviate memory bandwidth bottlenecks and achieve additional acceleration. We conduct extensive offline evaluations and large-scale online A/B experiments at ByteDance, demonstrating that UG-Sep reduces inference latency by up to 20 percent without degrading online user experience or commercial metrics across multiple business scenarios, including feed recommendation and advertising systems.",

We first consider the i.i.d. arrival model and show that the pure greedy algorithm -- which myopically chooses the welfare-maximizing integral allocation -- achieves $\\widetilde{O}(1/T)$ average regret. Importantly, in contrast to prior work, our algorithm does not require distributional knowledge and achieves the optimal regret rate using only the online samples. We then go beyond i.i.d. arrivals and investigate a nonstationary model with time-varying independent distributions. In the absence of additional data about the distributions, it is known that every online algorithm must suffer $\\Omega(1)$ average regret. We show that only a single historical sample from each distribution is sufficient to recover the optimal $\\widetilde{O}(1/T)$ average regret rate, even in the face of arbitrary non-stationarity. Our algorithms are based on the re-solving paradigm: they assume that the remaining items will be the ones seen historically in those periods and solve the resulting welfare-maximization problem to determine the decision in every period. Finally, we also account for distribution shifts that may distort the fidelity of historical samples and show that the performance of our re-solving algorithms is robust to such shifts.",

        "abstract": "We study the pricing query complexity of revenue maximization for a single buyer whose private valuation is drawn from an unknown distribution. In this setting, the seller must learn the optimal monopoly price by posting prices and observing only binary purchase decisions, rather than the realized valuations. Prior work has established tight query complexity bounds for learning a near-optimal price with additive error $\\varepsilon$ when the valuation distribution is supported on $[0,1]$. However, our understanding of how to learn a near-optimal price that achieves at least a $(1-\\varepsilon)$ fraction of the optimal revenue remains limited. In this paper, we study the pricing query complexity of the single-buyer revenue maximization problem under such multiplicative error guarantees in several settings. Observe that when pricing queries are the only source of information about the buyer's distribution, no algorithm can achieve a non-trivial approximation, since the scale of the distribution cannot be learned from pricing queries alone. Motivated by this fundamental impossibility, we consider two natural and well-motivated models that provide \"scale hints\": (i) a one-sample hint, in which the algorithm observes a single realized valuation before making pricing queries; and (ii) a value-range hint, in which the valuation support is known to lie within $[1, H]$. For each type of hint, we establish pricing query complexity guarantees that are tight up to polylogarithmic factors for several classes of distributions, including monotone hazard rate (MHR) distributions, regular distributions, and general distributions.",

        "abstract": "When sensitive information is encoded in data, it is important to ensure the privacy of information when attempting to learn useful information from the data. There is a natural tradeoff whereby increasing privacy requirements may decrease the utility of a learning protocol. In the quantum setting of differential privacy, such tradeoffs between privacy and utility have so far remained largely unexplored. In this work, we study optimal privacy-utility tradeoffs for both generic and application-specific utility metrics when privacy is quantified by $(\\varepsilon,\\delta)$-quantum local differential privacy. In the generic setting, we focus on optimizing fidelity and trace distance between the original state and the privatized state. We show that the depolarizing mechanism achieves the optimal utility for given privacy requirements. We then study the specific application of learning the expectation of an observable with respect to an input state when only given access to privatized states. We derive a lower bound on the number of samples of privatized data required to achieve a fixed accuracy guarantee with high probability. To prove this result, we employ existing lower bounds on private quantum hypothesis testing, thus showcasing the first operational use of them. We also devise private mechanisms that achieve optimal sample complexity with respect to the privacy parameters and accuracy parameters, demonstrating that utility can be significantly improved for specific tasks in contrast to the generic setting. In addition, we show that the number of samples required to privately learn observable expectation values scales as $\\Theta((\\varepsilon \\beta)^{-2})$, where $\\varepsilon \\in (0,1)$ is the privacy parameter and $\\beta$ is the accuracy tolerance. We conclude by initiating the study of private classical shadows, which promise useful applications for private learning tasks.",

We demonstrate robust performance in simulation and successful transfer to physical hardware, executing multi-directional jumps onto platforms up to 1.5 m in height. Specifically, one of the robots achieves a foot-end elevation of 1.1 m, which represents a 144% improvement over the 0.45 m jump height of a standalone quadrupedal robot, demonstrating superior vertical performance.

This paper looks at the problem from a statistical viewpoint, illustrating that one can actually hope for improvement when models are trained on data contaminated with synthetic samples, as long as there is some amount of fresh information from the true target distribution. In particular, we consider iterative training on samples sourced from a mixture of the true target and synthetic distributions. We analyze the entire iterative evolution in a next-token prediction language model, capturing how the interplay between the mixture weights and the sample size controls the overall long-term performance. With non-trivial mixture weight of the true distribution, even if it decays over time, simply training the model in a contamination-agnostic manner with appropriate sample sizes can avoid collapse and even recover the true target distribution under certain conditions. Simulation studies support our findings and also show that such behavior is more general for other classes of models.",

        "abstract": "The SHAP (short for Shapley additive explanation) framework has become an essential tool for attributing importance to variables in predictive tasks. In model-agnostic settings, SHAP uses the concept of Shapley values from cooperative game theory to fairly allocate credit to the features in a vector $X$ based on their contribution to an outcome $Y$. While the explanations offered by SHAP are local by nature, learners often need global measures of feature importance in order to improve model explainability and perform feature selection. The most common approach for converting these local explanations into global ones is to compute either the mean absolute SHAP or mean squared SHAP. However, despite their ubiquity, there do not exist approaches for performing statistical inference on these quantities. In this paper, we take a semi-parametric approach for calibrating confidence in estimates of the $p$th powers of Shapley additive explanations. We show that, by treating the SHAP curve as a nuisance function that must be estimated from data, one can reliably construct asymptotically normal estimates of the $p$th powers of SHAP. When $p \\geq 2$, we show a de-biased estimator that combines U-statistics with Neyman orthogonal scores for functionals of nested regressions is asymptotically normal. When $1 \\leq p < 2$ (and the hence target parameter is not twice differentiable), we construct de-biased U-statistics for a smoothed alternative. In particular, we show how to carefully tune the temperature parameter of the smoothing function in order to obtain inference for the true, unsmoothed $p$th power. We complement these results by presenting a Neyman orthogonal loss that can be used to learn the SHAP curve via empirical risk minimization and discussing excess risk guarantees for commonly used function classes.",

We propose a distributional viewpoint and introduce **statistical provability**, defined as the finite-horizon success probability of reaching a verified proof, averaged over an instance distribution, and formalize modern theorem-proving pipelines as time-bounded MDPs. Exploiting Bellman structure, we prove existence of optimal policies under mild regularity, derive provability certificates via sub-/super-solution inequalities, and bound the performance gap of score-guided planning (greedy/top-\\(k\\)/beam/rollouts) in terms of approximation error, sequential statistical complexity, representation geometry (metric entropy/doubling structure), and action-gap margin tails. Together, our theory provides a principled, component-sensitive explanation of when and why agentic theorem provers succeed on biased real-world problem distributions, while clarifying limitations in worst-case or adversarial regimes.",

We observe that sinusoidal random Fourier features possess a cyclic derivative structure: the derivative of any order of $\\sin(\\mathbf{W}\\cdot\\mathbf{x}+b)$ is a single sinusoid with a monomial prefactor, computable in $O(1)$ operations. Alternative activations such as $\\tanh$, used in prior one-shot methods like PIELM, lack this property: their higher-order derivatives grow as $O(2^n)$ terms, requiring automatic differentiation for operator assembly. We propose FastLSQ, which combines frozen random Fourier features with analytical operator assembly to solve linear PDEs via a single least-squares call, and extend it to nonlinear PDEs via Newton--Raphson iteration where each linearized step is a FastLSQ solve. On a benchmark of 17 PDEs spanning 1 to 6 dimensions, FastLSQ achieves relative $L^2$ errors of $10^{-7}$ in 0.07\\,s on linear problems, three orders of magnitude more accurate and significantly faster than state-of-the-art iterative PINN solvers, and $10^{-8}$ to $10^{-9}$ on nonlinear problems via Newton iteration in under 9s.",

This viewpoint replaces entropy-rate accounting by cross-entropy accounting under model mismatch, and it introduces feasibility constraints that depend jointly on capacity, delay, and perceptual continuity requirements; the resulting operating set is typically a bounded perception-capacity band rather than a one-sided threshold.

We reformulate nonparametric regression as conditional sample mean estimation, which is implemented directly via the learned conditional diffusion model. Unlike traditional bootstrap methods that decouple the estimation of the conditional distribution, sampling, and nonparametric regression, our approach integrates these components into a unified generative framework. With the expressive capacity of diffusion models, our method facilitates both efficient sampling from high-dimensional or multimodal distributions and accurate nonparametric estimation. We establish rigorous theoretical guarantees for the proposed method. In particular, we derive optimal end-to-end convergence rates in the Wasserstein distance between the learned and target conditional distributions. Building on this foundation, we further establish the convergence guarantees of the resulting bootstrap procedure.

Prior work has investigated using flow as an intermediate representation to enable the use of human videos as a substitute, thereby reducing the amount of required robot demonstrations. However, most prior work has focused on the flow, either on the object or on specific points of the robot/hand, which cannot describe the motion of interaction. Meanwhile, relying on flow to achieve generalization to scenarios observed only in human videos remains limited, as flow alone cannot capture precise motion details. Furthermore, conditioning on scene observation to produce precise actions may cause the flow-conditioned policy to overfit to training tasks and weaken the generalization indicated by the flow. To address these gaps, we propose SFCrP, which includes a Scene Flow prediction model for Cross-embodiment learning (SFCr) and a Flow and Cropped point cloud conditioned Policy (FCrP). SFCr learns from both robot and human videos and predicts any point trajectories. FCrP follows the general flow motion and adjusts the action based on observations for precision tasks. Our method outperforms SOTA baselines across various real-world task settings, while also exhibiting strong spatial and instance generalization to scenarios seen only in human videos.",

In particular, we propose a top-down tree-structured statistical algorithm that allows for the progressive refinement of a CRD based on ranking data, from the Dirac mass at a Kemeny median at the root of the tree to the empirical ranking data distribution itself at the end of the tree's exhaustive growth. In addition to the theoretical arguments developed, the relevance of the algorithm is empirically supported by various numerical experiments.",

Just like SE, these tasks often employ deep learning; however, deploying additional models on-device is computationally impractical, whereas cloud-based inference would introduce additional latency and compromise privacy. Prior work on SE employed Dynamic Channel Pruning (DynCP) to reduce computation by adaptively disabling specific channels based on the current input. In this work, we investigate whether useful signal properties can be estimated from these internal pruning masks, thus removing the need for separate models. We show that simple, interpretable predictors achieve up to 93% accuracy on VAD, 84% on noise classification, and an R2 of 0.86 on F0 estimation. With binary masks, predictions reduce to weighted sums, inducing negligible overhead. Our contribution is twofold: on one hand, we examine the emergent behavior of DynCP models through the lens of downstream prediction tasks, to reveal what they are learning; on the other, we repurpose and re-propose DynCP as a holistic solution for efficient SE and simultaneous estimation of signal properties.",

However, constructing a minimal high-dimensional model where this advantage can be rigorously analyzed has remained an open theoretical challenge. We introduce a tractable high-dimensional spiked model with two latent factors: one visible to covariance, and one statistically dependent yet uncorrelated, appearing only in higher-order moments. PCA and linear autoencoders fail to recover the latter, while a minimal nonlinear autoencoder provably extracts both. We analyze both the population risk, and empirical risk minimization.

These metrics are designed to be transferable to different multi-agent sequential domains similar to foraging. The proposed suite of metrics is structured into three main categories that jointly provide a multilevel characterization of cooperation: primary metrics, inter-team metrics, and intra-team metrics. They have been validated in a realistic destructive foraging scenario inspired by dynamic aquatic surface cleaning using heterogeneous autonomous vehicles. It involves two specialized teams with sequential dependencies: one focused on the search of resources, and another on their destruction.

While recent advances in data-driven methods have leveraged historical data to learn and optimize assortments, these approaches typically rely on strong assumptions -- namely, the stability of customer preferences and the correctness of the underlying choice models. However, such assumptions frequently break in real-world scenarios due to preference shifts and model misspecification, leading to poor generalization and revenue loss. Motivated by this limitation, we propose a robust framework for data-driven assortment optimization that accounts for potential distributional shifts in customer choice behavior. Our approach models potential preference shift from a nominal choice model that generates data and seeks to maximize worst-case expected revenue. We first establish the computational tractability of robust assortment planning when the nominal model is known, then advance to the data-driven setting, where we design statistically optimal algorithms that minimize the data requirements while maintaining robustness. Our theoretical analysis provides both upper bounds and matching lower bounds on the sample complexity, offering theoretical guarantees for robust generalization. Notably, we uncover and identify the notion of ``robust item-wise coverage'' as the minimal data requirement to enable sample-efficient robust assortment learning. Our work bridges the gap between robustness and statistical efficiency in assortment learning, contributing new insights and tools for reliable assortment optimization under uncertainty.",

This paper introduces a unified architecture that decouples high-level decision-making from vehicle-specific control, enabling algorithms to be evaluated consistently across different abstraction levels without modification. The proposed architecture is realized through GuadalPlanner, which defines standardized interfaces between planning, sensing, and vehicle execution. It is an open and extensible research tool that supports discrete graph-based environments and interchangeable planning strategies, and is built upon widely adopted robotics technologies, including ROS2, MAVLink, and MQTT. Its design allows the same algorithmic logic to be deployed in fully simulated environments, software-in-the-loop configurations, and physical autonomous vehicles using an identical execution pipeline. The approach is validated through a set of experiments, including real-world deployment on an autonomous surface vehicle performing water quality monitoring with real-time sensor feedback.",

In this work, we develop a Bayesian framework for signal component decomposition, which combines Gibbs sampling with plug-and-play (PnP) diffusion priors to draw component samples from the posterior distribution. Unlike many existing methods, our framework supports incorporating model-driven and data-driven prior knowledge into the diffusion prior in a unified manner. Moreover, the proposed posterior sampler allows component priors to be learned separately and flexibly combined without retraining. Under suitable assumptions, the proposed DiG sampler provably produces samples from the posterior distribution. We also show that DiG can be interpreted as an extension of a class of recently proposed diffusion-based samplers, and that, for suitable classes of sensing operators, DiG better exploits the structure of the measurement model. Numerical experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our method over existing approaches.",

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success, however, the emergence of content generation distortion (hallucination) limits their practical applications. The core cause of hallucination lies in LLMs' lack of awareness regarding their stored internal knowledge, preventing them from expressing their knowledge state on questions beyond their internal knowledge boundaries, as humans do. However, existing research on knowledge boundary expression primarily focuses on white-box LLMs, leaving methods suitable for black-box LLMs which offer only API access without revealing internal parameters-largely unexplored. Against this backdrop, this paper proposes LSCL (LLM-Supervised Confidence Learning), a deep learning-based method for expressing the knowledge boundaries of black-box LLMs. Based on the knowledge distillation framework, this method designs a deep learning model. Taking the input question, output answer, and token probability from a black-box LLM as inputs, it constructs a mapping between the inputs and the model' internal knowledge state, enabling the quantification and expression of the black-box LLM' knowledge boundaries. Experiments conducted on diverse public datasets and with multiple prominent black-box LLMs demonstrate that LSCL effectively assists black-box LLMs in accurately expressing their knowledge boundaries. It significantly outperforms existing baseline models on metrics such as accuracy and recall rate. Furthermore, considering scenarios where some black-box LLMs do not support access to token probability, an adaptive alternative method is proposed. The performance of this alternative approach is close to that of LSCL and surpasses baseline models.",

        "abstract": "Deep learning models trained in a supervised setting have revolutionized audio and speech processing. However, their performance inherently depends on the quantity of human-annotated data, making them costly to scale and prone to poor generalization under unseen conditions. To address these challenges, Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising paradigm, leveraging vast amounts of unlabeled data to learn relevant representations. The application of SSL for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has been extensively studied, but research on other downstream tasks, notably Speaker Recognition (SR), remains in its early stages. This work describes major SSL instance-invariance frameworks (e.g., SimCLR, MoCo, and DINO), initially developed for computer vision, along with their adaptation to SR. Various SSL methods for SR, proposed in the literature and built upon these frameworks, are also presented. An extensive review of these approaches is then conducted: (1) the effect of the main hyperparameters of SSL frameworks is investigated; (2) the role of SSL components is studied (e.g., data-augmentation, projector, positive sampling); and (3) SSL frameworks are evaluated on SR with in-domain and out-of-domain data, using a consistent experimental setup, and a comprehensive comparison of SSL methods from the literature is provided. Specifically, DINO achieves the best downstream performance and effectively models intra-speaker variability, although it is highly sensitive to hyperparameters and training conditions, while SimCLR and MoCo provide robust alternatives that effectively capture inter-speaker variability and are less prone to collapse. This work aims to highlight recent trends and advancements, identifying current challenges in the field.",

Although the target is globally a high-degree polynomial, its compositional structure allows learning to proceed in stages: an intermediate representation reveals structure that is inaccessible at the input level. This reduces learning to simpler spectral estimation problems, well studied in the context of multi-index models, whereas any shallow estimator must resolve all components simultaneously. Our analysis relies on Gaussian universality, leading to sharp separations in sample complexity between two and three-layer learning strategies.",

Our approach employs string matching based on suffix arrays that scales well with corpus size. To mitigate the combinatorial explosion induced by the semantic relaxation of queries, our method is built on two key algorithmic ideas: fast exact lookup enabled by a disk-aware design, and dynamic corpus-aware pruning. We theoretically show that the proposed method suppresses exponential growth in the search space with respect to query length by leveraging statistical properties of natural language. In experiments on FineWeb-Edu (Lozhkov et al., 2024) (1.4T tokens), we show that our method achieves significantly lower search latency than existing methods: infini-gram (Liu et al., 2024), infini-gram mini (Xu et al., 2025), and SoftMatcha (Deguchi et al., 2025). As a practical application, we demonstrate that our method identifies benchmark contamination in training corpora, unidentified by existing approaches.

This parameter characterizes a sharp phase transition between vanishing and exploding activations, and we calculate the Lyapunov exponent explicitly for Gaussian or orthogonal weight matrices. Our results reveal that standard methods, such as He initialization or orthogonal initialization, do not guarantee activation stabilty for deep networks of low width.

Among all such tunings, we prove that minimizing the impact of estimation error on the path-space Kullback--Leibler divergence selects, in closed form, a Föllmer process -- a diffusion whose path measure minimizes relative entropy with respect to a reference process determined by the interpolation schedules alone. This yields a new variational characterization of Föllmer processes, complementing classical formulations via Schrödinger bridges and stochastic control. We further establish that, under this optimal diffusion coefficient, the path-space Kullback--Leibler divergence becomes independent of the interpolation schedule, rendering different schedules statistically equivalent in this variational sense.",

We study two neural network-based agents that must communicate numerosities in a referential game using either discrete tokens or continuous sketches, thus exploring both symbolic and iconic representations. Without any pre-defined numeric concepts, the agents achieve high in-distribution communication accuracy in both communication channels and converge on high-precision symbol-meaning mappings. However, the emergent code is non-compositional: the agents fail to derive systematic messages for unseen numerosities, typically reusing the symbol of the highest trained numerosity (discrete), or collapsing extrapolated values onto a single sketch (continuous). We conclude that the communication pressure alone suffices for precise transmission of learned numerosities, but additional pressures are needed to yield compositional codes and generalisation abilities.",

While recent works have further proven the universality of a (slightly generalized) model, the next immediate question pertains to its trainability, i.e., whether it suffers from the exponentially vanishing loss gradients, known as the barren plateau issue, preventing effective use, and how regimes of trainability overlap with regimes of possible quantum advantage. Here, we provide significant strides in these directions. To study the trainability at initialization, we analytically derive closed-form expressions for the variances of the partial derivatives of the MMD loss function and provide general upper and lower bounds. With uniform initialization, we show that barren plateaus depend on the generator set and the spectrum of the chosen kernel. We identify regimes in which low-weight-biased kernels avoid exponential gradient suppression in structured topologies. Also, we prove that a small-variance Gaussian initialization ensures polynomial scaling for the gradient under mild conditions. As for the potential quantum advantage, we further argue, based on previous complexity-theoretic arguments, that sparse IQP families can output a probability distribution family that is classically intractable, and that this distribution remains trainable at initialization at least at lower-weight frequencies.",

In this context, it is known that the issue of posterior sampling is a thorny one. This paper introduces a Gibbs algorithm. It appears that this avenue has not been explored, and we show that this approach is particularly effective and remarkably simple. In addition, it offers a guarantee of convergence in a clearly identified situation. The results are clearly confirmed by numerical simulations.",

        "abstract": "Biometric footstep recognition, based on a person's unique pressure patterns under their feet during walking, is an emerging field with growing applications in security and safety. However, progress in this area has been limited by the lack of large, diverse datasets necessary to address critical challenges such as generalization to new users and robustness to shifts in factors like footwear or walking speed. The recent release of the UNB StepUP-P150 dataset, the largest and most comprehensive collection of high-resolution footstep pressure recordings to date, opens new opportunities for addressing these challenges through deep learning. To mark this milestone, the First International StepUP Competition for Biometric Footstep Recognition was launched. Competitors were tasked with developing robust recognition models using the StepUP-P150 dataset that were then evaluated on a separate, dedicated test set designed to assess verification performance under challenging variations, given limited and relatively homogeneous reference data. The competition attracted global participation, with 23 registered teams from academia and industry. The top-performing team, Saeid_UCC, achieved the best equal error rate (EER) of 10.77% using a generative reward machine (GRM) optimization strategy. Overall, the competition showcased strong solutions, but persistent challenges in generalizing to unfamiliar footwear highlight a critical area for future work.",

        "abstract": "We introduce Renet, a principled generalization of the Relaxed Lasso to the Elastic Net family of estimators. While, on the one hand, $\\ell_1$-regularization is a standard tool for variable selection in high-dimensional regimes and, on the other hand, the $\\ell_2$ penalty provides stability and solution uniqueness through strict convexity, the standard Elastic Net nevertheless suffers from shrinkage bias that frequently yields suboptimal prediction accuracy. We propose to address this limitation through a framework called \\textit{relaxation}. Existing relaxation implementations rely on naive linear interpolations of penalized and unpenalized solutions, which ignore the non-linear geometry that characterizes the entire regularization path and risk violating the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. Renet addresses these limitations by enforcing sign consistency through an adaptive relaxation procedure that dynamically dispatches between convex blending and efficient sub-path refitting. Furthermore, we identify and formalize a unique synergy between relaxation and the ``One-Standard-Error'' rule: relaxation serves as a robust debiasing mechanism, allowing practitioners to leverage the parsimony of the 1-SE rule without the traditional loss in predictive fidelity. Our theoretical framework incorporates automated stability safeguards for ultra-high dimensional regimes and is supported by a comprehensive benchmarking suite across 20 synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating that Renet consistently outperforms the standard Elastic Net and provides a more robust alternative to the Adaptive Elastic Net in high-dimensional, low signal-to-noise ratio and high-multicollinearity regimes. By leveraging an adaptive solver backend, Renet delivers these statistical gains while offering a computational profile that remains competitive with state-of-the-art coordinate descent implementations.",

Current $P^{-1}$ methods suffer from a fundamental limitation -- they can only generate a fixed surface-like structure in data space, which poorly covers the richness of this space. We address this by a new method that can `sweep' the data space under user control. Our method works generically for any $P$ technique and dataset, is controlled by two intuitive user-set parameters, and is simple to implement. We demonstrate it by an extensive application involving image manipulation for style transfer.",

        "abstract": "The Euclidean distance between wavelet scattering transform coefficients (known as paths) provides informative gradients for perceptual quality assessment of deep inverse problems in computer vision, speech, and audio processing. However, these transforms are computationally expensive when employed as differentiable loss functions for stochastic gradient descent due to their numerous paths, which significantly limits their use in neural network training. Against this problem, we propose \"Scattering transform with Random Paths for machine Learning\" (SCRAPL): a stochastic optimization scheme for efficient evaluation of multivariable scattering transforms. We implement SCRAPL for the joint time-frequency scattering transform (JTFS) which demodulates spectrotemporal patterns at multiple scales and rates, allowing a fine characterization of intermittent auditory textures. We apply SCRAPL to differentiable digital signal processing (DDSP), specifically, unsupervised sound matching of a granular synthesizer and the Roland TR-808 drum machine. We also propose an initialization heuristic based on importance sampling, which adapts SCRAPL to the perceptual content of the dataset, improving neural network convergence and evaluation performance. We make our code and audio samples available and provide SCRAPL as a Python package.",

We introduce YOR, an open-source, low-cost mobile manipulator that integrates an omnidirectional base, a telescopic vertical lift, and two arms with grippers to achieve whole-body mobility and manipulation. Our design emphasizes modularity, ease of assembly using off-the-shelf components, and affordability, with a bill-of-materials cost under 10,000 USD. We demonstrate YOR's capability by completing tasks that require coordinated whole-body control, bimanual manipulation, and autonomous navigation. Overall, YOR offers competitive functionality for mobile manipulation research at a fraction of the cost of existing platforms. Project website: this https URL",
