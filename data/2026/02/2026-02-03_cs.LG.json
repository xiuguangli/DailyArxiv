        "abstract": "We propose a measurement framework for difficult-to-access contexts that uses indirect data traces, interpretable machine-learning models, and theory-guided triangulation to fill inaccessible measurement spaces. Many high-stakes systems of scientific and policy interest are difficult, if not impossible, to reach directly: dynamics of interest are unobservable, data are indirect and fragmented across sources, and ground truth is absent or concealed. In these settings, available data often do not support conventional strategies for analysis, such as statistical inference on a single authoritative data stream or model validation against labeled outcomes. To address this problem, we introduce a general framework for measurement in data regimes characterized by structurally missing or adversarial data. We propose combining multi-source triangulation with interpretable machine learning models. Rather than relying on accuracy against unobservable, unattainable ideal data, our framework seeks consistency across separate, partially informative models. This allows users to draw defensible conclusions about the state of the world based on cross-signal consistency or divergence from an expected state. Our framework provides an analytical workflow tailored to quantitative characterization in the absence of data sufficient for conventional statistical or causal inference. We demonstrate our approach and explicitly surface inferential limits through an empirical analysis of organizational growth and internal pressure dynamics in a clandestine militant organization, drawing on multiple observational signals that individually provide incomplete and biased views of the underlying process. The results show how triangulated, interpretable ML can recover substantively meaningful variation.",

However, cloud-based LLM deployments face three key limitations: high computational and energy demands, privacy and reliability risks from remote processing, and recurring API costs. Recent advances in agentic AI, especially in structured reasoning and tool use, offer a better way to exploit open and locally deployed tools and LLMs. This paper presents ELLMPEG, an edge-enabled agentic LLM framework for the automated generation of video-processing commands. ELLMPEG integrates tool-aware Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with iterative self-reflection to produce and locally verify executable FFmpeg and VVenC commands directly at the edge, eliminating reliance on external cloud APIs. To evaluate ELLMPEG, we collect a dedicated prompt dataset comprising 480 diverse queries covering different categories of FFmpeg and the Versatile Video Codec (VVC) encoder (VVenC) commands. We validate command generation accuracy and evaluate four open-source LLMs based on command validity, tokens generated per second, inference time, and energy efficiency. We also execute the generated commands to assess their runtime correctness and practical applicability. Experimental results show that Qwen2.5, when augmented with the ELLMPEG framework, achieves an average command-generation accuracy of 78 % with zero recurring API cost, outperforming all other open-source models across both the FFmpeg and VVenC datasets.",

This work introduces an agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework designed to support the three canonical phases of disaster response: initial rescue, mid-term recovery, and long-term reconstruction. To achieve robust multimodal grounding, we construct a hierarchical knowledge base that integrates textual disaster manuals, historical lessons (e.g., the 2011 Tohoku earthquake), and both aerial and ground-level imagery. Our system builds on the open-source multimodal implementation, which processes 46 tsunami-related PDFs (2,378 pages) using BLIP-based image captioning, ColVBERT embeddings, and long-context summarization to generate an efficient, structured multimodal retrieval tree optimized for disaster knowledge preservation. An agentic controller dynamically selects retrieval strategies (e.g., RAPTOR, ColBERT) through entropy-aware scene abstraction, enabling adaptive reasoning across heterogeneous inputs. Additionally, a lightweight LoRA-based post-training method injects experiential knowledge from past disasters, enhancing the models' capacity to support both expert and non-expert responders. Experiments on real disaster datasets demonstrate improved situational grounding, enhanced task decomposition accuracy, and superior usability for emergency operations. Incorporating recent advances in long-context RAG systems, agentic information retrieval, and contemporary emergency response AI, our system achieves substantial gains through adaptive retrieval-augmented generation with self-reasoning and multimodal chain-of-thought capabilities.",

However, it remains unclear whether such diagnostics generalize across languages and cultural contexts. We extend the Beacon single-turn forced-choice sycophancy diagnostic to Hindi through a controlled three-condition design: English original, Hindi literal translation, and Hindi culturally adapted prompts. We evaluate four open-weight instruction-tuned models on 50 prompts per condition, enabling separation of language encoding effects from cultural adaptation effects. Across all models, sycophancy rates are consistently higher for culturally adapted Hindi prompts than for English, with absolute differences ranging from 12.0 to 16.0 percentage points. A decomposition on Qwen 2.5-Coder-7B shows that cultural adaptation (delta = 14.0%, 95% CI: [4.0%, 26.0%]) accounts for the majority of this gap, while language encoding contributes minimally (delta = 2.0%, 95% CI: [0.0%, 6.0%]). Category-level analysis reveals that advice prompts exhibit the largest cross-lingual differences (20-25 percentage points), achieving statistical significance in two of four models. These findings indicate that alignment behaviors measured in English may not transfer uniformly across languages and that culturally grounded prompt framing plays a substantial role.

This paper introduces a new training methodology, Supervised Contrastive Parallel Learning (SCPL), that addresses this issue by decoupling BP and transforming a long gradient flow into multiple short ones. This design enables the simultaneous computation of parameter gradients in different layers, achieving superior model parallelism and enhancing training throughput. Detailed experiments are presented to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our model compared to BP, Early Exit, GPipe, and Associated Learning (AL), a state-of-the-art method for decoupling backpropagation. By mitigating a fundamental performance bottleneck, SCPL provides a practical pathway for organizations to develop and deploy advanced information systems more cost-effectively and with greater agility.

Existing graph contrastive learning methods typically rely on either random perturbations (e.g., edge dropping) to generate diverse views or purely spectral augmentations (e.g., SVD) to preserve global structural priors. However, random perturbations are structure-agnostic and may remove critical edges, while SVD-based views often become dense and lack sufficient diversity. To bridge this gap, we propose SPGCL, a robust graph contrastive learning framework via SVD-guided structural perturbation. SPGCL couples lightweight stochastic edge removal with an SVD-guided refinement step that can recover mistakenly removed informative edges and introduce semantically meaningful missing links while avoiding graph densification through sparse top-ranked edge selection and merging. By balancing edge removal and recovery rates, SPGCL explicitly controls structural discrepancy between views so that contrastive signals reflect semantic structural differences rather than edge-count gaps. We further incorporate a contrastive fusion module regularized by a global similarity constraint to better align the two views. Extensive experiments on ten benchmark datasets demonstrate that SPGCL consistently improves robustness and accuracy of base GNNs, outperforming state-of-the-art graph contrastive learning and structure learning methods.",

This presents a major challenge, as high-fidelity (HF) data is often scarce and computationally expensive to acquire, while low-fidelity (LF) data is abundant but less accurate. To address this data scarcity problem, we develop a probabilistic multi-fidelity surrogate framework based on generative transfer learning. We employ a normalizing flow (NF) generative model as the backbone, which is trained in two phases: (i) the NF is first pretrained on a large LF dataset to learn a probabilistic forward model; (ii) the pretrained model is then fine-tuned on a small HF dataset, allowing it to correct for LF-HF discrepancies via knowledge transfer. To relax the dimension-preserving constraint of standard bijective NFs, we integrate surjective (dimension-reducing) layers with standard coupling blocks. This architecture enables learned dimension reduction while preserving the ability to train with exact likelihoods. The resulting surrogate provides fast probabilistic predictions with quantified uncertainty and significantly outperforms LF-only baselines while using fewer HF evaluations. We validate the approach on a reinforced concrete slab benchmark, combining many coarse-mesh (LF) simulations with a limited set of fine-mesh (HF) simulations. The proposed model achieves probabilistic predictions with HF accuracy, demonstrating a practical path toward data-efficient, generative AI-driven surrogates for complex engineering systems.",

By lifting the sampling granularity from scalar values to classes of values that follow the same control flow path, we increase the information gathered per simulation evaluation. Our derivation from an established smoothed gradient estimator shows that the method does not introduce any bias. We present an implementation via a custom numerical data type to transparently carry out dimensional peeking over C++ programs. Variance reductions by factors of up to 7.9 are observed for three simulation-based optimization problems with high-dimensional input.

Empirically, we validate our approach across diverse tasks, including mathematical reasoning and text-to-image alignment, for controlling and understanding model behavior. We found that for text-to-image generation, GPT-Image tends to focus on grammatical adherence, while Imagen 4 prioritizes atmospheric coherence. In mathematical reasoning, distractor variables confuse GPT-5 but leave Gemini 2.5 models and o4-mini largely unaffected. Moreover, our results show that the learned constitutions are highly effective for controlling model behavior, achieving an average of 1.86 times boost in success rate over methods that do not use constitutions.",

        "abstract": "Algorithmic fairness has become a central concern in computational decision-making systems, where ensuring equitable outcomes is essential for both ethical and legal reasons. Two dominant notions of fairness have emerged in the literature: Group Fairness (GF), which focuses on mitigating disparities across demographic subpopulations, and Individual Fairness (IF), which emphasizes consistent treatment of similar individuals. These notions have traditionally been studied in isolation. In contrast, this survey examines methods that jointly address GF and IF, integrating both perspectives within unified frameworks and explicitly characterizing the trade-offs between them. We provide a systematic and critical review of hybrid fairness approaches, organizing existing methods according to the fairness mechanisms they employ and the algorithmic and mathematical strategies used to reconcile multiple fairness criteria. For each class of methods, we examine their theoretical foundations, optimization mechanisms, and empirical evaluation practices, and discuss their limitations. Additionally, we discuss the challenges and identify open research directions for developing principled, context-aware hybrid fairness methods. By synthesizing insights across the literature, this survey aims to serve as a comprehensive resource for researchers and practitioners seeking to design hybrid algorithms that provide reliable fairness guarantees at both the individual and group levels.",

We compare multiple machine learning approaches for mortgage default prediction using a real-world loan-level dataset, with emphasis on leakage control and imbalance handling. We employ leakage-aware feature selection, a strict temporal split that constrains both origination and reporting periods, and controlled downsampling of the majority class. Across multiple positive-to-negative ratios, performance remains stable, and an AutoML approach (AutoGluon) achieves the strongest AUROC among the models evaluated.

Inference-time ensemble methods can improve performance by sampling diverse reasoning paths or aggregating multiple candidate answers, but they typically treat candidates independently and provide no formal guarantees that ensembling improves reasoning quality. We propose a novel method, Aligned Delegation for Multi-Agent LLM Reasoning (ALIGN), which formulates LLM reasoning as an aligned delegation game. In ALIGN, a principal delegates a task to multiple agents that generate candidate solutions under designed incentives, and then selects among their outputs to produce a final answer. This formulation induces structured interaction among agents while preserving alignment between agent and principal objectives. We establish theoretical guarantees showing that, under a fair comparison with equal access to candidate solutions, ALIGN provably improves expected performance over single-agent generation. Our analysis accommodates correlated candidate answers and relaxes independence assumptions that are commonly used in prior work. Empirical results across a broad range of LLM reasoning benchmarks consistently demonstrate that ALIGN outperforms strong single-agent and ensemble baselines.",

While classical AI-based methods have been developed for early diagnosis and stage classification of AD, growing data volumes and limited computational resources necessitate faster, more efficient approaches. Quantum-based AI methods, which leverage superposition and entanglement principles along with high-dimensional Hilbert space, can surpass classical approaches' limitations and offer higher accuracy for high-dimensional, heterogeneous, and noisy data. In this study, a Quantum-Based Parallel Model (QBPM) architecture is proposed for the efficient classification of AD stages using MRI datasets, inspired by the principles of classical model parallelism. The proposed model leverages quantum advantages by employing two distinct quantum circuits, each incorporating rotational and entanglement blocks, running in parallel on the same quantum simulator. The classification performance of the model was evaluated on two different datasets to assess its overall robustness and generalization capability. The proposed model demonstrated high classification accuracy across both datasets, highlighting its overall robustness and generalization capability. Results obtained under high-level Gaussian noise, simulating real-world conditions, further provided experimental evidence for the model's applicability not only in theoretical but also in practical scenarios. Moreover, compared with five different classical transfer learning methods, the proposed model demonstrated its efficiency as an alternative to classical approaches by achieving higher classification accuracy and comparable execution time while utilizing fewer circuit parameters. The results indicate that the proposed QBPM architecture represents an innovative and powerful approach for the classification of stages in complex diseases such as Alzheimer's.",

The framework further incorporates confidence-calibrated generation to selectively refine low-confidence outputs.

Analyzing 52 pretrained ImageNet models across 13 architecture families, we show that effective dimension -- an unsupervised geometric metric -- strongly predicts accuracy. Output effective dimension achieves partial r=0.75 ($p < 10^(-10)$) after controlling for model capacity, while total compression achieves partial r=-0.72. These findings replicate across ImageNet and CIFAR-10, and generalize to NLP: effective dimension predicts performance for 8 encoder models on SST-2/MNLI and 15 decoder-only LLMs on AG News (r=0.69, p=0.004), while model size does not (r=0.07). We establish bidirectional causality: degrading geometry via noise causes accuracy loss (r=-0.94, $p < 10^(-9)$), while improving geometry via PCA maintains accuracy across architectures (-0.03pp at 95% variance). This relationship is noise-type agnostic -- Gaussian, Uniform, Dropout, and Salt-and-pepper noise all show $|r| > 0.90$.

Standard uniform quantizers assume that parameters are evenly distributed, an assumption at odds with the highly skewed distributions observed in practice. We propose Benford-Quant, a simple, data-free non-uniform quantizer inspired by Benford's Law, which predicts that leading digits follow a logarithmic distribution. Benford-Quant replaces the uniform grid with a log-spaced codebook, dedicating more resolution to the frequent small-magnitude weights. We provide both theoretical intuition and empirical evidence: (i) weights in transformer transformational layers adhere closely to Benford statistics, while normalization layers systematically deviate; (ii) on Small Language Models (SLMs), Benford-Quant consistently improves perplexity, reducing 4-bit perplexity on Gemma-270M by more than 10%; and (iii) on larger LLMs, it remains competitive, with differences explained by over-parameterization effects. Our results indicate that incorporating a Benford-inspired prior into quantization grids is a low-cost modification that yields accuracy gains in aggressive few-bit regimes. Although it is not able to surpass the state of the art in tasks such as perplexity and LAMBADA, the Benford-Quant approach can be hybridized with other quantization methods-such as SmoothQuant and Activation-Aware Quantization-without major pipeline modification, potentially improving their performance.",

We also observe a second seemingly separate phenomenon: under fixed hyperparameters, the stochastic fine-tuning reward often rises, peaks, and then degrades in both ES and GRPO. We argue that both effects reflect a shared geometric property of fine-tuning landscapes: they are low-dimensional in curvature. A small set of high-curvature dimensions dominates improvement, producing (i) heterogeneous time scales that yield rise-then-decay under fixed stochasticity, as captured by a minimal quadratic stochastic-ascent model, and (ii) degenerate improving updates, where many random perturbations share similar components along these directions. Using ES as a geometric probe on fine-tuning reward landscapes of GSM8K, ARC-C, and WinoGrande across Qwen2.5-Instruct models (0.5B--7B), we show that reward-improving perturbations remain empirically accessible with small populations across scales. Together, these results reconcile ES scalability with non-monotonic training dynamics and suggest that high-dimensional fine-tuning may admit a broader class of viable optimization methods than worst-case theory implies.",

We find that the distributional discrepancy in the denoising process serves as a measurable indicator of how much of the mapping is retained, also reflecting the strength of unlearning. Inspired by this, we propose IVO (Initial Latent Variable Optimization), a concise and powerful attack framework that reactivates these dormant memories by reconstructing the broken mappings. Through Image Inversion}, Adversarial Optimization and Reused Attack, IVO optimizes initial latent variables to realign the noise distribution of unlearned models with their original unsafe states. Extensive experiments across 8 widely used unlearning techniques demonstrate that IVO achieves superior attack success rates and strong semantic consistency, exposing fundamental flaws in current defenses.

Local linear methods for generating explanations, such as LIME and SHAP, have been criticized for being unstable near decision boundaries. In this paper, we explain that such concerns reflect a misunderstanding of the problem. The forecast uncertainty is high at decision boundaries, so consequently, the explanatory instability is high. The correct approach is to change the sequence of events and questions being asked. Nonlinear models can be highly predictive in some regions while having little or no predictability in others. Therefore, the first question is whether a usable forecast exists. When there is a forecast with low enough uncertainty to be useful, an explanation can be sought via a local linear approximation. In such cases, the explanatory instability is correspondingly low. When no usable forecast exists, the decision must fall to a simpler overall model such as traditional logistic regression. Additionally, these results show that some methods that purport to be explainable everywhere, such as ReLU networks or any piecewise linear model, have only an illusory explainability, because the forecast uncertainty at the segment boundaries is too high to be useful. Explaining an unusable forecast is pointless.",

        "abstract": "Modern generative models can produce realistic samples, however, balancing memorisation and generalisation remains an open problem. We approach this challenge from a Bayesian perspective by focusing on the parameter space of flow matching and diffusion models and constructing a predictive posterior that better captures the variability of the data distribution. In particular, we capture the geometry of the loss using a Riemannian metric and leverage a flexible approximate posterior that adapts to the local structure of the loss landscape. This approach allows us to sample generative models that resemble the original model, but exhibit reduced memorisation. Empirically, we demonstrate that the proposed approach reduces memorisation while preserving generalisation. Further, we provide a theoretical analysis of our method, which explains our findings. Overall, our work illustrates how considering the geometry of the loss enables effective use of the parameter space, even for complex high-dimensional generative models.",

        "abstract": "Unsupervised anomaly detection is a challenging problem due to the diversity of data distributions and the lack of labels. Ensemble methods are often adopted to mitigate these challenges by combining multiple detectors, which can reduce individual biases and increase robustness. Yet building an ensemble that is genuinely complementary remains challenging, since many detectors rely on similar decision cues and end up producing redundant anomaly scores. As a result, the potential of ensemble learning is often limited by the difficulty of identifying models that truly capture different types of irregularities. To address this, we propose a methodology for characterizing anomaly detectors through their decision mechanisms. Using SHapley Additive exPlanations, we quantify how each model attributes importance to input features, and we use these attribution profiles to measure similarity between detectors. We show that detectors with similar explanations tend to produce correlated anomaly scores and identify largely overlapping anomalies. Conversely, explanation divergence reliably indicates complementary detection behavior. Our results demonstrate that explanation-driven metrics offer a different criterion than raw outputs for selecting models in an ensemble. However, we also demonstrate that diversity alone is insufficient; high individual model performance remains a prerequisite for effective ensembles. By explicitly targeting explanation diversity while maintaining model quality, we are able to construct ensembles that are more diverse, more complementary, and ultimately more effective for unsupervised anomaly detection.",

To better understand LLM scaling, we study representational differences between LLMs and their smaller counterparts, with the goal of replicating the representational qualities of larger models in the smaller models. We observe a geometric phenomenon which we term $\\textbf{embedding condensation}$, where token embeddings collapse into a narrow cone-like subspace in some language models. Through systematic analyses across multiple Transformer families, we show that small models such as $\\texttt{GPT2}$ and $\\texttt{Qwen3-0.6B}$ exhibit severe condensation, whereas the larger models such as $\\texttt{GPT2-xl}$ and $\\texttt{Qwen3-32B}$ are more resistant to this phenomenon. Additional observations show that embedding condensation is not reliably mitigated by knowledge distillation from larger models. To fight against it, we formulate a dispersion loss that explicitly encourages embedding dispersion during training. Experiments demonstrate that it mitigates condensation, recovers dispersion patterns seen in larger models, and yields performance gains across 10 benchmarks. We believe this work offers a principled path toward improving smaller Transformers without additional parameters.",

To approximate this surface integral in a single training run, we introduce efficient block-stochastic sampling, which aggregates feature activity magnitudes across diverse regularization regimes along the optimization trajectory. The resulting statistics are antisymmetric by construction, ensuring finite-sample FDR control. In extensive experiments on synthetic and semi-real data, GRIP2 demonstrates improved robustness to feature correlation and noise level: in high correlation and low signal-to-noise ratio regimes where standard deep learning based feature selectors may struggle, our method retains high power and stability. Finally, on real-world HIV drug resistance data, GRIP2 recovers known resistance-associated mutations with power better than established linear baselines, confirming its reliability in practice.",

However, current sampling methods rely on simple confidence-based heuristics that ignore the long-term impact of local decisions, leading to trajectory lock-in where early hallucinations cascade into global incoherence. While search-based methods mitigate this, they incur prohibitive computational costs ($O(K)$ forward passes per step). In this work, we propose Backward-on-Entropy (BoE) Steering, a gradient-guided inference framework that approximates infinite-horizon lookahead via a single backward pass. We formally derive the Token Influence Score (TIS) from a first-order expansion of the trajectory cost functional, proving that the gradient of future entropy with respect to input embeddings serves as an optimal control signal for minimizing uncertainty. To ensure scalability, we introduce \\texttt{ActiveQueryAttention}, a sparse adjoint primitive that exploits the structure of the masking objective to reduce backward pass complexity. BoE achieves a superior Pareto frontier for inference-time scaling compared to existing unmasking methods, demonstrating that gradient-guided steering offers a mathematically principled and efficient path to robust non-autoregressive generation.

Our analysis yields three key insights: (1) The benefits of Easy-First decoding (prioritizing low-entropy tokens) are magnified as model error increases; (2) factorized parallel decoding introduces intrinsic sampling errors that can lead to arbitrary large Reverse KL divergence, capturing \"incoherence\" failures that standard Forward KL metrics overlook; and (3) while verification can eliminate sampling error, it incurs an exponential cost governed by the total correlation within a block.

However, we identify a critical representation paradox, termed Latent Chaos: models with accurate predictions often learn latent representations that are temporally disordered and lack continuity. We attribute this phenomenon to the dominant observation-space forecasting paradigm. Most TSF models minimize point-wise errors on noisy and partially observed data, which encourages shortcut solutions instead of the recovery of underlying system dynamics. To address this issue, we propose Latent Time Series Forecasting (LatentTSF), a novel paradigm that shifts TSF from observation regression to latent state prediction. Specifically, LatentTSF employs an AutoEncoder to project observations at each time step into a higher-dimensional latent state space. This expanded representation aims to capture underlying system variables and impose a smoother temporal structure. Forecasting is then performed entirely in the latent space, allowing the model to focus on learning structured temporal dynamics. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that our proposed latent objectives implicitly maximize mutual information between predicted latent states and ground-truth states and observations. Extensive experiments on widely-used benchmarks confirm that LatentTSF effectively mitigates latent chaos, achieving superior performance. Our code is available in this https URL.",

Verified flow graphs are then compiled into mechanistic models supporting interpretable parameter learning under physical and epidemiological constraints.

Limits of learning: The aleatoric floor is exactly measurable, and architectures differ markedly in how they approach it: ResNets exhibit clean power-law scaling while Vision Transformers stall in low-data regimes. Soft labels: Oracle posteriors contain learnable structure beyond class labels: training with exact posteriors outperforms hard labels and yields near-perfect calibration. Distribution shift: The oracle computes exact KL divergence of controlled perturbations, revealing that shift type matters more than shift magnitude: class imbalance barely affects accuracy at divergence values where input noise causes catastrophic degradation. Active learning: Exact epistemic uncertainty distinguishes genuinely informative samples from inherently ambiguous ones, improving sample efficiency. Our framework reveals that standard metrics hide ongoing learning, mask architectural differences, and cannot diagnose the nature of distribution shift.",

Existing approaches mitigate memory pressure by offloading model state and KV tensors to host memory, but incur substantial latency due to limited PCIe bandwidth. We present Harvest, an opportunistic GPU cache management framework that exploits high-bandwidth peer-to-peer GPU interconnects to dynamically place model weights and KV cache in unused GPU memory. Harvest treats peer GPU memory as a transient cache tier, preserving correctness while reducing data movement overhead under dynamic memory availability. We demonstrate significant throughput speedup of more than 2 times by using Harvest to accelerate the retrieval of two widely-used inference components: expert layer weights and KV cache entries.",

Prototype-based XAI methods offer an intrinsically interpretable alternative to post-hoc approaches which often yield inconsistent explanations. Prototype-based XAI methods make predictions based on the similarity between inputs and learned prototypes that represent typical characteristics of target classes. However, existing prototype-based models are primarily designed for standard RGB image data and are not optimized for the distinct, variable-specific channels commonly found in geoscientific image and raster datasets. In this study, we develop a prototype-based XAI approach tailored for multi-channel geospatial data, where each channel represents a distinct physical environmental variable or spectral channel. Our approach enables the model to identify separate, channel-specific prototypical characteristics sourced from multiple distinct training examples that inform how these features individually and in combination influence model prediction while achieving comparable performance to standard neural networks. We demonstrate this method through two geoscientific case studies: (1) classification of Madden Julian Oscillation phases using multi-variable climate data and (2) land-use classification from multispectral satellite imagery. This approach produces both local (instance-level) and global (model-level) explanations for providing insights into feature-relevance across channels. By explicitly incorporating channel-prototypes into the prediction process, we discuss how this approach enhances the transparency and trustworthiness of ML models for geoscientific learning tasks.",

Yet, existing steering methods are remarkably brittle, with seemingly non-steerable concepts becoming completely steerable based on subtle algorithmic choices in how concept-related features are extracted. In this work, we introduce an attention-guided steering framework that overcomes three core challenges associated with steering: (1) automatic selection of relevant token embeddings for extracting concept-related features; (2) accounting for heterogeneity of concept-related features across LLM activations; and (3) identification of layers most relevant for steering. Across a steering benchmark of 512 semantic concepts, our framework substantially improved steering over previous state-of-the-art (nearly doubling the number of successfully steered concepts) across model architectures and sizes (up to 70 billion parameter models). Furthermore, we use our framework to shed light on the distribution of concept-specific features across LLM layers. Overall, our framework opens further avenues for developing efficient, highly-scalable fine-tuning algorithms for industry-scale LLMs.",

Motivated by these limitations, we study generative inference models guided by a unified reward function capturing core AP deployment objectives across diverse floorplans. We show that diffusion samplers consistently outperform alternative generative approaches. The diffusion process progressively improves sampling by smoothing and sharpening the reward landscape, rather than relying on iterative refinement, which is effective for non-convex and fragmented objectives. Finally, we introduce a large-scale real-world dataset for indoor AP deployment, requiring over $50k$ CPU hours to train general reward functions, and evaluate in- and out-of-distribution generalization and robustness. Our results suggest that diffusion-based generative inference with a unified reward function provides a scalable and domain-agnostic foundation for indoor AP deployment planning.",

To this end, we propose Quantum Generator Kernels (QGKs), a generator-based approach to quantum kernels, comprising a set of Variational Generator Groups (VGGs) that merge universal generators into a parameterizable operator, ensuring scalable coverage of the available quantum space. Thereby, we address shortcomings of current leading strategies employing hybrid architectures, which might prevent exploiting quantum computing's full potential due to fixed intermediate embedding processes. To optimize the kernel alignment to the target domain, we train a weight vector to parameterize the projection of the VGGs in the current data context. Our empirical results demonstrate superior projection and classification capabilities of the QGK compared to state-of-the-art quantum and classical kernel approaches and show its potential to serve as a versatile framework for various QML applications.",

Using MATRIX as a controlled diagnostic, we isolate the effect of visual grounding by comparing post-training on structured materials science text alone with post-training that incorporates paired experimental images. Despite using relatively small amounts of multimodal data, visual supervision improves experimental interpretation by 10-25% and yields 5-16% gains on text-only scientific reasoning tasks.

This robustness, however, is not absolute. We identify a simple yet effective failure mode, termed context nesting, where harmful requests are embedded within structured benign contexts, effectively bypassing the stepwise reduction mechanism. Empirically, we show that this simple strategy is sufficient to bypass D-LLMs' safety blessing, achieving state-of-the-art attack success rates across models and benchmarks. Most notably, it enables the first successful jailbreak of Gemini Diffusion, to our knowledge, exposing a critical vulnerability in commercial D-LLMs. Together, our results characterize both the origins and the limits of D-LLMs' safety blessing, constituting an early-stage red-teaming of D-LLMs.",

In detail, we investigate how input tokens access memory locations within FFN parameters and the importance of FFN memory across different downstream tasks. MemoryLLM achieves context-free FFNs by training them in isolation from self-attention directly using the token embeddings. This approach allows FFNs to be pre-computed as token-wise lookups (ToLs), enabling on-demand transfer between VRAM and storage, additionally enhancing inference efficiency.

However, in prior investigations, the eigenvectors of the DR were computed by first approximating the DR matrix, and then performing an eigendecomposition. This procedure is computationally expensive and does not scale to high-dimensional spaces. In this paper, we derive an objective for directly approximating the principal eigenvector of the DR with a neural network. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the objective in a number of environments, and apply the learned eigenvectors for reward shaping.",

        "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been intensively studied for their expressive representation and learning performance on graph-structured data, enabling effective modeling of complex relational dependencies among nodes and edges in various domains. However, the standalone GNNs can unleash threat surfaces and privacy implications, as some sensitive graph-structured data is collected and processed in a centralized setting. To solve this issue, Federated Graph Neural Networks (FedGNNs) are proposed to facilitate collaborative learning over decentralized local graph data, aiming to preserve user privacy. Yet, emerging research indicates that even in these settings, shared model updates, particularly gradients, can unintentionally leak sensitive information of local users. Numerous privacy inference attacks have been explored in traditional federated learning and extended to graph settings, but the problem of label distribution inference in FedGNNs remains largely underexplored. In this work, we introduce Fed-Listing (Federated Label Distribution Inference in GNNs), a novel gradient-based attack designed to infer the private label statistics of target clients in FedGNNs without access to raw data or node features. Fed-Listing only leverages the final-layer gradients exchanged during training to uncover statistical patterns that reveal class proportions in a stealthy manner. An auxiliary shadow dataset is used to generate diverse label partitioning strategies, simulating various client distributions, on which the attack model is obtained. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets and three GNN architectures show that Fed-Listing significantly outperforms existing baselines, including random guessing and Decaf, even under challenging non-i.i.d. scenarios. Moreover, applying defense mechanisms can barely reduce our attack performance, unless the model's utility is severely degraded.",

Although AutoML methods for classification are able to deal with data imperfections, such as outliers, multiple scales and missing data, their behavior is less known on dirty categorical datasets. These datasets often have several categorical features with high cardinality arising from issues such as lack of curation and automated collection. Recent research has shown that ML models can benefit from morphological encoders for dirty categorical data, leading to significantly superior predictive performance. However the effects of using such encoders in AutoML methods are not known at the moment. In this paper, we propose a pipeline that transforms categorical data into numerical data so that an AutoML can handle categorical data transformed by more advanced encoding schemes. We benchmark the current robustness of AutoML methods on a set of dirty datasets and compare it with the proposed pipeline. This allows us to get insight on differences in predictive performance. We also look at the ML pipelines built by AutoMLs in order to gain insight beyond the best model as typically returned by these methods.",

We introduce scBatchProx, a post-hoc optimization method inspired by federated learning principles for refining cell-level embeddings produced by arbitrary upstream methods. Treating each batch as a client, scBatchProx learns batch-conditioned adapters under proximal regularization, correcting batch structure directly in latent space without requiring raw expression data or centralized optimization. The method is lightweight and deployable, optimizing batch-specific adapter parameters only. Extensive experiments show that scBatchProx consistently yields relative gains of approximately 3-8% in overall embedding quality, with batch correction and biological conservation improving in 90% and 85% of data-method pairs, respectively.

We introduce Open Materials Generation with Inference-time Reinforcement Learning (OMatG-IRL), a policy-gradient RL framework that operates directly on the learned velocity fields and eliminates the need for the explicit computation of the score. OMatG-IRL leverages stochastic perturbations of the underlying generation dynamics preserving the baseline performance of the pretrained generative model while enabling exploration and policy-gradient estimation at inference time. Using OMatG-IRL, we present the first application of RL to crystal structure prediction (CSP). Our method enables effective reinforcement of an energy-based objective while preserving diversity through composition conditioning, and it achieves performance competitive with score-based RL approaches. Finally, we show that OMatG-IRL can learn time-dependent velocity-annealing schedules, enabling accurate CSP with order-of-magnitude improvements in sampling efficiency and, correspondingly, reduction in generation time.",

Self-attention emerges naturally as a repeated bilinear--softmax--linear composition, yielding highly expressive sequence models. This formulation enables principled analysis of alignment-induced behaviors (including sycophancy), inference-time phenomena (such as hallucination, in-context learning, chain-of-thought prompting, and retrieval-augmented generation), and extensions like continual learning, while serving as a concise reference for interpretation and further theoretical development.",

We address this problem by building non-fine-tunable foundation models: models that remain broadly usable in their released form while yielding limited adaptation gains under task-agnostic unauthorized fine-tuning. We propose Private Mask Pre-Training (PMP), a pre-training framework that concentrates representation learning into a sparse subnetwork identified early in training. The binary mask defining this subnetwork is kept private, and only the final dense weights are released. This forces unauthorized fine-tuning without access to the mask to update parameters misaligned with pretraining subspace, inducing an intrinsic mismatch between the fine-tuning objective and the pre-training geometry. We provide theoretical analysis showing that this mismatch destabilizes gradient-based adaptation and bounds fine-tuning gains. Empirical results on large language models demonstrating that PMP preserves base model performance while consistently degrading unauthorized fine-tuning across a wide range of downstream tasks, with the strength of non-fine-tunability controlled by the mask ratio.",

At the beginning of each episode, SIERL chooses a sub-goal from the \\textit{frontier} (the boundary of the agent's known state space), before the agent continues exploring toward the main task objective. The key contribution of our method is the sub-goal selection mechanism, which provides state-action pairs that are neither overly familiar nor completely novel. Thus, it assures that the frontier is expanded systematically and that the agent is capable of reaching any state within it. Inspired by search, sub-goals are prioritized from the frontier based on estimates of cost-to-come and cost-to-go, effectively steering exploration towards the most informative regions.

        "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) based post-training for large language models (LLMs) is computationally expensive, as it generates many rollout sequences that could frequently share long token prefixes. Existing RL frameworks usually process these sequences independently, repeatedly recomputing identical prefixes during forward and backward passes during policy model training, leading to substantial inefficiencies in computation and memory usage. Although prefix sharing naturally induces a tree structure over rollouts, prior tree-attention-based solutions rely on fully materialized attention masks and scale poorly in RL settings. In this paper, we introduce AREAL-DTA to efficiently exploit prefix sharing in RL training. AREAL-DTA employs a depth-first-search (DFS)-based execution strategy that dynamically traverses the rollout prefix tree during both forward and backward computation, materializing only a single root-to-leaf path at a time. To further improve scalability, AREAL-DTA incorporates a load-balanced distributed batching mechanism that dynamically constructs and processes prefix trees across multiple GPUs. Across the popular RL post-training workload, AREAL-DTA achieves up to $8.31\\times$ in $\\tau^2$-bench higher training throughput.",

We propose OD-DEAL, an adversarial learning framework that tightly integrates hybrid genetic search (HGS) and online barycenter clustering (BCC) decomposition, and leverages high-fidelity knowledge distillation to transfer expert heuristic behavior. OD-DEAL trains a graph attention network (GAT)-based generative policy through a minimax game, in which divide-and-conquer strategies from a hybrid expert are distilled into dense surrogate rewards. This enables high-quality, clustering-free inference on large-scale instances. Empirical results demonstrate that OD-DEAL achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) real-time CVRP performance, solving 10000-node instances with near-constant neural scaling.

        "abstract": "Despite their empirical success, neural network classifiers remain difficult to interpret. In softmax-based models, class regions are defined implicitly as solutions to systems of inequalities among logits, making them difficult to extract and visualize. We introduce Partition of Unity Neural Networks (PUNN), an architecture in which class probabilities arise directly from a learned partition of unity, without requiring a softmax layer. PUNN constructs $k$ nonnegative functions $h_1, \\ldots, h_k$ satisfying $\\sum_i h_i(x) = 1$, where each $h_i(x)$ directly represents $P(\\text{class } i \\mid x)$. Unlike softmax, where class regions are defined implicitly through coupled inequalities among logits, each PUNN partition function $h_i$ directly defines the probability of class $i$ as a standalone function of $x$. We prove that PUNN is dense in the space of continuous probability maps on compact domains. The gate functions $g_i$ that define the partition can use various activation functions (sigmoid, Gaussian, bump) and parameterizations ranging from flexible MLPs to parameter-efficient shape-informed designs (spherical shells, ellipsoids, spherical harmonics). Experiments on synthetic data, UCI benchmarks, and MNIST show that PUNN with MLP-based gates achieves accuracy within 0.3--0.6\\% of standard multilayer perceptrons. When geometric priors match the data structure, shape-informed gates achieve comparable accuracy with up to 300$\\times$ fewer parameters. These results demonstrate that interpretable-by-design architectures can be competitive with black-box models while providing transparent class probability assignments.",

In electronic health records (EHRs), for example, medical events are grouped into a sequence of clinical encounters with well-defined temporal structure, but the order and timing of events within each encounter may be unknown or unreliable. Most existing foundation models (FMs) for event stream data flatten this hierarchy into a one-dimensional sequence, leading to (i) computational inefficiency associated with dense attention and learning spurious within-set relationships, and (ii) lower-quality set-level representations from heuristic post-training pooling for downstream tasks. Here, we show that preserving the original hierarchy in the FM architecture provides a useful inductive bias that improves both computational efficiency and representation quality. We then introduce Nested Event Stream Transformer (NEST), a FM for event streams comprised of sequences of multisets. Building on this architecture, we formulate Masked Set Modeling (MSM), an efficient paradigm that promotes improved set-level representation learning. Experiments on real-world multiset sequence data show that NEST captures real-world dynamics while improving both pretraining efficiency and downstream performance.",

We find that different tasks give rise to qualitatively and quantitatively distinct world representation geometries. However, multi-task training drives convergence of world representations: models trained on non-overlapping tasks develop aligned geometric representations, providing controlled evidence for the Multitask Scaling Hypothesis of the Platonic Representation Hypothesis. To study adaptation, we pretrain models on all tasks, then test whether new entities (cities) can be consistently integrated into the representation space via fine-tuning. Surprisingly, we find that despite multi-task pretraining, some tasks, which we call divergent, actively harm the representational integration of new entities and harm generalization. Our results show that training on multiple relational tasks reliably produces convergent world representations, but lurking divergent tasks can catastrophically harm new entity integration via fine-tuning.",

AIRE-Prune assigns every state a closed-form asymptotic impulse-response energy-based score, i.e., the total impulse-response energy it contributes over an infinite horizon (time), and normalizes these scores layer-wise to enable global cross-layer comparison and selection. This extends modal truncation from single systems to deep stacks and aligns pruning with asymptotic response energy rather than worst-case gain. Across diverse sequence benchmarks, AIRE-Prune reveals substantial redundancy in SISO and MIMO SSMs with average pruning of 60.8%, with average accuracy drop of 0.29% without retraining, while significantly lowering compute.

Rather than learning to compress long sequences, each sweeper learns a much simpler 2-to-1 compression task, achieving O(log N) depth with sublinear error accumulation in sequence length.

To address the above issues, we propose OpenDDI, a comprehensive benchmark for DDI prediction. Specifically, (1) from the data perspective, OpenDDI unifies 6 widely used DDI datasets and 2 existing forms of drug representation, while additionally contributing 3 new large-scale LLM-augmented datasets and a new multimodal drug representation covering 5 modalities. (2) From the evaluation perspective, OpenDDI unifies 20 SOTA model baselines across 3 downstream tasks, with standardized protocols for data quality, effectiveness, generalization, robustness, and efficiency.

The sequential nature of EHR, analogous to natural language, has motivated the use of next-token prediction to train prior EHR Foundation Models (FMs) over events. However, this training fails to capture the full structure of EHR. We propose ORA, a marked time-to-event pretraining objective that jointly models event timing and associated measurements. Across multiple datasets, downstream tasks, and model architectures, this objective consistently yields more generalizable representations than next-token prediction and pretraining losses that ignore continuous measurements. Importantly, the proposed objective yields improvements beyond traditional classification evaluation, including better regression and time-to-event prediction. Beyond introducing a new family of FMs, our results suggest a broader takeaway: pretraining objectives that account for EHR structure are critical for expanding downstream capabilities and generalizability",

Prior work has attributed the well-documented ``bulk-and-spike'' spectral structure, where a few dominant eigenvalues are separated from a bulk of smaller ones, to the imbalance in the data covariance matrix. In this work, we challenge this view by demonstrating that such spectral Bifurcation can arise purely from the network architecture, independent of data imbalance. Specifically, we analyze a deep linear network setup and prove that, even when the data covariance is perfectly balanced, the Hessian still exhibits a Bifurcation eigenvalue structure: a dominant cluster and a bulk cluster. Crucially, we establish that the ratio between dominant and bulk eigenvalues scales linearly with the network depth. This reveals that the spectral gap is strongly affected by the network architecture rather than solely by data distribution. Our results suggest that both model architecture and data characteristics should be considered when designing optimization algorithms for deep networks.",

To address this limitation, we propose Clade-AHD, an efficient framework that replaces node-level point estimates with clade-level Bayesian beliefs. By aggregating descendant evaluations into Beta distributions and performing Thompson Sampling over these beliefs, Clade-AHD explicitly models uncertainty to guide exploration, enabling more reliable decision-making under sparse and noisy evaluations.

We propose OEU, a novel Orthogonal Entropy Unlearning framework with two key innovations: 1) Entropy-guided unlearning maximizes prediction uncertainty on forgotten data, achieving genuine forgetting rather than confident misprediction, and 2) Gradient orthogonal projection eliminates interference by projecting forgetting gradients onto the orthogonal complement of retain gradients, providing theoretical guarantees for utility preservation under first-order approximation.

In this work, we theoretically analyze an in-context linear regression model with multi-head linear self-attention, and compare the training dynamics of two gradient based optimizers, namely gradient descent (GD) and sharpness-aware minimization (SAM), the latter exhibiting superior generalization properties but is prohibitively expensive for training even medium-sized LLMs. We show, for the first time, that SAM induces a lower simplicity bias (SB)-the tendency of an optimizer to preferentially learn simpler features earlier in training-and identify this reduction as a key factor underlying its improved generalization performance. Motivated by this insight, we demonstrate that altering the training data distribution by upsampling or augmenting examples learned later in training similarly reduces SB and leads to improved generalization. Our extensive experiments show that our strategy improves the performance of multiple LLMs-including Phi2-2.7B , Llama3.2-1B, Gemma3-1B-PT, and Qwen3-0.6B-Base-achieving relative accuracy gains up to 18% when fine-tuned with AdamW and Muon on mathematical reasoning tasks.",

Machine unlearning has emerged as a promising solution to selectively remove such information without full retraining. However, existing methods are designed for dense models and overlook model sparsification-an essential technique for efficient LLM deployment. We find that unlearning effectiveness degrades substantially on sparse models. Through empirical analysis, we reveal that this degradation occurs because existing unlearning methods require updating all parameters, yet sparsification prunes substantial weights to zero, fundamentally limiting the model's forgetting capacity. To address this challenge, we propose Sparsity-Aware Unlearning (SAU), which decouples unlearning from sparsification objectives through gradient masking that redirects updates to surviving weights, combined with importance-aware redistribution to compensate for pruned parameters.

In parallel, the Local Time Module introduces a query-based patch mixing mechanism to adaptively aggregate informative temporal patches and alleviate information density imbalance. Finally, TFMixer fuses the time-domain and frequency-domain representations to generate forecasts and further leverages inverse NUDFT for explicit seasonal extrapolation.

Our approach combines three key mechanisms: (1) Adaptive Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (aSGLD) for reward critics, promoting ensemble diversity and escape from poor optima; (2) distributional cost estimation via Implicit Quantile Networks (IQN) with Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) optimization for tail-risk mitigation; and (3) a reactive Lagrangian relaxation scheme that adapts constraint enforcement based on the empirical CVaR of episodic costs. We provide theoretical guarantees on CVaR estimation error and demonstrate that CVaR-based Lagrange updates yield stronger constraint violation signals than expected-cost updates. On Safety-Gymnasium benchmarks, SL-SAC achieves the lowest cost in 7 out of 10 tasks while maintaining competitive returns, with cost reductions of 19-63% in velocity tasks compared to state-of-the-art baselines.",

        "abstract": "Time series forecasting is important in many fields that require accurate predictions for decision-making. Patching techniques, commonly used and effective in time series modeling, help capture temporal dependencies by dividing the data into patches. However, existing patch-based methods fail to dynamically select patches and typically use all patches during the prediction process. In real-world time series, there are often low-quality issues during data collection, such as missing values, distribution shifts, anomalies and white noise, which may cause some patches to contain low-quality information, negatively impacting the prediction results. To address this issue, this study proposes a robust time series forecasting framework called SEER. Firstly, we propose an Augmented Embedding Module, which improves patch-wise representations using a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture and obtains series-wise token representations through a channel-adaptive perception mechanism. Secondly, we introduce a Learnable Patch Replacement Module, which enhances forecasting robustness and model accuracy through a two-stage process: 1) a dynamic filtering mechanism eliminates negative patch-wise tokens; 2) a replaced attention module substitutes the identified low-quality patches with global series-wise token, further refining their representations through a causal attention mechanism. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the SOTA performance of SEER.",

        "abstract": "Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) aim to capture the evolving structure and timing of interactions in dynamic graphs. Although many models incorporate time through encodings or architectural design, they often compute attention over entangled node and edge representations, failing to reflect their distinct temporal behaviors. Node embeddings evolve slowly as they aggregate long-term structural context, while edge features reflect transient, timestamped interactions (e.g. messages, trades, or transactions). This mismatch results in semantic attention blurring, where attention weights cannot distinguish between slowly drifting node states and rapidly changing, information-rich edge interactions. As a result, models struggle to capture fine-grained temporal dependencies and provide limited transparency into how temporal relevance is computed. This paper introduces KEAT (Kernelized Edge Attention for Temporal Graphs), a novel attention formulation that modulates edge features using a family of continuous-time kernels, including Laplacian, RBF, and learnable MLP variant. KEAT preserves the distinct roles of nodes and edges, and integrates seamlessly with both Transformer-style (e.g., DyGFormer) and message-passing (e.g., TGN) architectures. It achieves up to 18% MRR improvement over the recent DyGFormer and 7% over TGN on link prediction tasks, enabling more accurate, interpretable and temporally aware message passing in TGNNs.",

These algorithms work with very limited feedback in the form of pairwise preferences and fine-tune models to align with these preferences without explicitly learning a reward model. While the form of feedback used by these algorithms makes the data collection process easy and relatively more accurate, its ambiguity in terms of the quality of responses could have negative implications. For example, it is not clear if a decrease (increase) in the likelihood of preferred (dispreferred) responses during the execution of these algorithms could be interpreted as a positive or negative phenomenon. In this paper, we study how to design algorithms that can leverage additional information in the form of rating gap, which informs the learner how much the chosen response is better than the rejected one. We present new algorithms that can achieve faster statistical rates than DPO in presence of accurate rating gap information. Moreover, we theoretically prove and empirically show that the performance of our algorithms is robust to inaccuracy in rating gaps. Finally, we demonstrate the solid performance of our methods in comparison to a number of DPO-style algorithms across a wide range of LLMs and evaluation benchmarks.",

We establish convergence to (approximate) equilibria in two-agent zero-sum and multi-agent identical-interest stochastic games over an infinite horizon.

We introduce layer sensitivity, a gradient-based metric inspired by GradCAM and effective receptive field theory, which quantifies both positive and negative contributions of each time point to a layer's latent features. Applying this metric to a three-layer MLP backbone reveals depth-specific specialization in modeling temporal dynamics in the input sequence. Motivated by these insights, we propose MoDEx, a lightweight Mixture of Depth-specific Experts, which replaces complex backbones with depth-specific MLP experts. MoDEx achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on seven real-world benchmarks, ranking first in 78 percent of cases, while using significantly fewer parameters and computational resources.

While limiting exploration to a feasible zone has become widely accepted as a way to ensure safety, key questions remain unresolved: what is the maximum feasible zone achievable through exploration, and how can it be identified? This paper, for the first time, answers these questions by revealing that the goal of safe exploration is to find the equilibrium between the feasible zone and the environment model. This conclusion is based on the understanding that these two components are interdependent: a larger feasible zone leads to a more accurate environment model, and a more accurate model, in turn, enables exploring a larger zone. We propose the first equilibrium-oriented safe exploration framework called safe equilibrium exploration (SEE), which alternates between finding the maximum feasible zone and the least uncertain model. Using a graph formulation of the uncertain model, we prove that the uncertain model obtained by SEE is monotonically refined, the feasible zones monotonically expand, and both converge to the equilibrium of safe exploration. Experiments on classic control tasks show that our algorithm successfully expands the feasible zones with zero constraint violation, and achieves the equilibrium of safe exploration within a few iterations.",

        "abstract": "With the proliferation of distributed data sources, Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a key approach to enable collaborative intelligence through decentralized model training while preserving data privacy. However, conventional FL algorithms often suffer from performance disparities across clients caused by heterogeneous data distributions and unequal participation, which leads to unfair outcomes. Specifically, we focus on two core fairness challenges, i.e., representation bias, arising from misaligned client representations, and collaborative bias, stemming from inequitable contribution during aggregation, both of which degrade model performance and generalizability. To mitigate these disparities, we propose CoRe-Fed, a unified optimization framework that bridges collaborative and representation fairness via embedding-level regularization and fairness-aware aggregation. Initially, an alignment-driven mechanism promotes semantic consistency between local and global embeddings to reduce representational divergence. Subsequently, a dynamic reward-penalty-based aggregation strategy adjusts each client's weight based on participation history and embedding alignment to ensure contribution-aware aggregation. Extensive experiments across diverse models and datasets demonstrate that CoRe-Fed improves both fairness and model performance over the state-of-the-art baseline algorithms.",

To effectively capture this periodic heterogeneity, we propose PHAT (Period Heterogeneity-Aware Transformer). Specifically, PHAT arranges multivariate inputs into a three-dimensional \"periodic bucket\" tensor, where the dimensions correspond to variate group characteristics with similar periodicity, time steps aligned by phase, and offsets within the period. By restricting interactions within buckets and masking cross-bucket connections, PHAT effectively avoids interference from inconsistent periods. We also propose a positive-negative attention mechanism, which captures periodic dependencies from two perspectives: periodic alignment and periodic deviation. Additionally, the periodic alignment attention scores are decomposed into positive and negative components, with a modulation term encoding periodic priors. This modulation constrains the attention mechanism to more faithfully reflect the underlying periodic trends. A mathematical explanation is provided to support this property. We evaluate PHAT comprehensively on 14 real-world datasets against 18 baselines, and the results show that it significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving highly competitive forecasting performance.

However, this paradigm suffers from two critical challenges: Structural Degeneration, where hierarchical and semantic representations are entangled, and Optimization Instability, which arises from oscillatory dynamics of minimax adversarial training. To tackle these issues, we propose DisRFM, a geometry-aware GDA framework that unifies Riemannian embedding and flow-based transport. First, to overcome structural degeneration, we embed graphs into a Riemannian manifold. By adopting polar coordinates, we explicitly disentangle structure (radius) from semantics (angle). Then, we enforce topology preservation through radial Wasserstein alignment and semantic discrimination via angular clustering, thereby preventing feature entanglement and collapse. Second, we address the instability of adversarial alignment by using Riemannian flow matching. This method learns a smooth vector field to guide source features toward the target along geodesic paths, guaranteeing stable convergence. The geometric constraints further guide the flow to maintain the disentangled structure during transport. Theoretically, we prove the asymptotic stability of the flow matching and derive a tighter bound for the target risk. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DisRFM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.",

EEG-based signals can reveal a persons emotional state, as they directly reflect activity in different brain regions. Emotion-aware systems and EEG-based emotion recognition are a growing research area. This paper presents how machine learning (ML) models categorize a limited dataset of EEG signals into three different classes, namely Negative, Neutral, or Positive. It also presents the complete workflow, including data preprocessing and comparison of ML models. To understand which ML classification model works best for this kind of problem, we train and test the following three commonly used models: logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF). The performance of each is evaluated with respect to accuracy and F1-score. The results indicate that ML models can be effectively utilized for three-way emotion classification of EEG signals. Among the three ML models trained on the available dataset, the RF model gave the best results. Its higher accuracy and F1-score suggest that it is able to capture the emotional patterns more accurately and effectively than the other two models. The RF model also outperformed the existing state-of-the-art classification models in terms of the accuracy parameter.",

Motivated by this insight, we propose SCP-$\\Delta_r$, a Near Access Freeness (NAF)-based algorithm that operates on relative probabilities and explicitly smooths low-impact tokens using a base model. SCP-$\\Delta_r$ achieves orders-of-magnitude better theoretical bounds than existing NAF based methods and provides strong empirical protection against TDE attacks with minimal performance loss.",

In this study, we examine two key challenges associated with feed-forward ReLU networks built on general directed acyclic graph (DAG) architectures: the (dis)connectedness of the parameter space and the existence of singularities within it. We extend previous results by providing a thorough characterization of connectedness, highlighting the roles of bottleneck nodes and balance conditions associated with specific subsets of the network. Our findings clearly demonstrate that singularities are intricately connected to the topology of the underlying DAG and its induced sub-networks. We discuss the reachability of these singularities and establish a principled connection with differentiable pruning. We validate our theory with simple numerical experiments.",

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in automating this process, existing approaches-including fine-tuned domain-specific models and advanced agent-based systems-struggle to scale to industrial IP-level design tasks. We identify three key challenges: (1) handling long, highly detailed documents, where critical interface constraints become buried in unrelated submodule descriptions; (2) generating long RTL code, where both syntactic and semantic correctness degrade sharply with increasing output length; and (3) navigating the complex debugging cycles required for functional verification through simulation and waveform analysis. To overcome these challenges, we propose LocalV, a multi-agent framework that leverages information locality in modular hardware design. LocalV decomposes the long-document to long-code generation problem into a set of short-document, short-code tasks, enabling scalable generation and debugging. Specifically, LocalV integrates hierarchical document partitioning, task planning, localized code generation, interface-consistent merging, and AST-guided locality-aware debugging. Experiments on RealBench, an IP-level Verilog generation benchmark, demonstrate that LocalV substantially outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs and agents, achieving a pass rate of 45.0% compared to 21.6%.",

From a knowledge-decomposition perspective, we observe that low-rank adaptations exhibit highly imbalanced singular value spectra: a few dominant components absorb most of the adaptation energy, thereby (i) more likely to disrupt previously acquired knowledge and (ii) making the update more vulnerable to interference from subsequent tasks. To enable explicit balance among components, we decouple the magnitude of the task update from its directional structure and formulate it as a constrained optimization problem on a restricted Stiefel manifold. We address this problem using a projected first-order method compatible with standard deep-learning optimizers used in vision-language models.

We investigate a mechanistic approach to preventing emergent misalignment by identifying a small set of internal features that reliably control the misaligned behavior and then discouraging the model from strengthening these features during fine-tuning. Across six fine-tuning domains, blocking (i.e., constraining) a fixed set of features achieves up to 95\\% relative reduction in emergent misalignment with no degradation in model quality or target-task performance. We strengthen validity with disjoint selection/evaluation splits, multiple independent judges, multiple random seeds for key settings, quality metrics, and extensive ablations demonstrating that the reduction in misalignment is specific to the identified mechanism. We also characterize a limiting regime in which misalignment re-emerges under prolonged fine-tuning, present evidence consistent with rerouting through alternative features or layers, and evaluate modifications that partially restore the misalignment-blocking effect. Overall, our results show that targeted training-time constraints on internal mechanisms can mitigate emergent misalignment without degrading target-task performance.",

However, existing methods largely rely on heuristic fingerprint-matching rules that lack provable error control and often overlook the existence of multiple sources, leaving the reliability of their provenance claims unverified. In this work, we first formalize the model provenance problem with provable guarantees, requiring rigorous coverage of all true provenances at a prescribed confidence level. Then, we propose the Model Provenance Set (MPS), which employs a sequential test-and-exclusion procedure to adaptively construct a small set satisfying the guarantee. The key idea of MPS is to test the significance of provenance existence within a candidate pool, thereby establishing a provable asymptotic guarantee at a user-specific confidence level. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MPS effectively achieves target provenance coverage while strictly limiting the inclusion of unrelated models, and further reveal its potential for practical provenance analysis in attribution and auditing tasks.",

Methodologically, the paper innovatively employs a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and a Double Machine Learning (DML) model to construct counterfactual scenarios, mitigating endogeneity concerns and precisely identifying the causal relationship between equity balance and greenwashing. The findings indicate, first, a significant negative causal relationship between equity balance and corporate greenwashing, confirming its substantive governance effect. Second, this inhibitory effect exhibits notable heterogeneity, manifesting more strongly in western regions, upstream segments of the industrial chain, and industries with high environmental sensitivity. Third, the governance effect demonstrates clear temporal dynamics, with the strongest impact occurring in the current period, followed by a diminishing yet statistically significant lagged effect, and ultimately a stable long-term cumulative influence. Finally, mechanism analysis reveals that equity balance operates through three distinct channels to curb greenwashing: alleviating management performance pressure, enhancing the stability of the executive team, and intensifying media scrutiny.",

Nevertheless, significant heterogeneity persists across regions, industries and individual enterprises regarding energy structure, production scale, policy intensity and governance efficacy, resulting in pronounced distribution shifts and non-stationarity in carbon emission data across both temporal and spatial dimensions. Such cross-regional and cross-enterprise data drift not only compromises the accuracy of carbon emission reporting but substantially undermines the guidance value of predictive models for production planning and carbon quota trading decisions. To address this critical challenge, we integrate causal inference perspectives with stable learning methodologies and time-series modelling, proposing a stable temporal prediction mechanism tailored to distribution shift environments. This mechanism incorporates enterprise-level energy inputs, capital investment, labour deployment, carbon pricing, governmental interventions and policy implementation intensity, constructing a risk consistency-constrained stable learning framework that extracts causal stable features (robust against external perturbations yet demonstrating long-term stable effects on carbon dioxide emissions) from multi-environment samples across diverse policies, regions and industrial sectors. Furthermore, through adaptive normalization and sample reweighting strategies, the approach dynamically rectifies temporal non-stationarity induced by economic fluctuations and policy transitions, ultimately enhancing model generalization capability and explainability in complex environments.",

We introduce a modified Q-function: rather than targeting the full-horizon, we learn a K-step lookahead Q-function that truncates planning to the next K steps. To further improve sample efficiency, we introduce a thresholding mechanism: actions are selected only when their estimated K-step lookahead value exceeds a time-varying threshold. We provide an efficient tabular learning algorithm for this novel objective, proving it achieves fast finite-sample convergence: it achieves minimax optimal constant regret for $K=1$ and $\\mathcal{O}(\\max((K-1),C_{K-1})\\sqrt{SAT\\log(T)})$ regret for any $K \\geq 2$.

While MoE decouples capacity from compute, it introduces large memory overhead and hardware efficiency challenges. To overcome these, we propose token-indexed parameters as a novel, orthogonal scaling axis that decouple model capacity from FLOPs. Specifically, we introduce Joint-Token (JTok) and Mixture of Joint-Token (JTok-M), which augment Transformer layers with modulation vectors retrieved from auxiliary embedding tables. These vectors modulate the backbone via lightweight, element-wise operations, incurring negligible FLOPs overhead. Extensive experiments on both dense and MoE backbones, spanning from 650M (190M + 460M embedding) to 61B (17B + 44B embedding) total parameters, demonstrate that our approach consistently reduces validation loss and significantly improves downstream task performance (e.g., +4.1 on MMLU, +8.3 on ARC, +8.9 on CEval). Rigorous isoFLOPs analysis further confirms that JTok-M fundamentally shifts the quality-compute Pareto frontier, achieving comparable model quality with 35% less compute relative to vanilla MoE architectures, and we validate that token-indexed parameters exhibit a predictable power-law scaling behavior. Moreover, our efficient implementation ensures that the overhead introduced by JTok and JTok-M remains marginal.",

While its impact has been extensively studied under the asymptotic regimes -- both in training time and FLS -- existing theory offers limited insight into how FLS affects generalization in practical settings, such as when training is stopped upon reaching a target training risk. In this work, we investigate the impact of FLS on generalization in deep networks under such practical conditions. Through empirical studies, we first uncover the emergence of an $\\textit{optimal FLS}$ -- neither too small nor too large -- that yields substantial generalization gains. This finding runs counter to the prevailing intuition that stronger feature learning universally improves generalization. To explain this phenomenon, we develop a theoretical analysis of gradient flow dynamics in two-layer ReLU nets trained with logistic loss, where FLS is controlled via initialization scale. Our main theoretical result establishes the existence of an optimal FLS arising from a trade-off between two competing effects: An excessively large FLS induces an $\\textit{over-alignment}$ phenomenon that degrades generalization, while an overly small FLS leads to $\\textit{over-fitting}$.",

However, their integration with Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures is constrained by an expert explosion: as the number of tokens generated in parallel increases, the number of distinct experts activated grows nearly linearly. This results in substantial memory traffic that pushes inference into a memory-bound regime, negating the efficiency gains of both MoE and parallel decoding. To address this challenge, we propose Dynamic Expert Sharing (DES), a novel technique that shifts MoE optimization from token-centric pruning and conventional expert skipping methods to sequence-level coreset selection. To maximize expert reuse, DES identifies a compact, high-utility set of experts to satisfy the requirements of an entire parallel decoding block. We introduce two innovative selection strategies: (1) Intra-Sequence Sharing (DES-Seq), which adapts optimal allocation to the sequence level, and (2) Saliency-Aware Voting (DES-Vote), a novel mechanism that allows tokens to collectively elect a coreset based on aggregated router weights. Extensive experiments on MoE dLLMs demonstrate that DES reduces unique expert activations by over 55% and latency by up to 38%, while retaining 99% of vanilla accuracy, effectively decoupling memory overhead from the degree of parallelism.",

        "abstract": "Neural operators have shown promise in learning solution maps of partial differential equations (PDEs), but they often struggle to generalize when test inputs lie outside the training distribution, such as novel initial conditions, unseen PDE coefficients or unseen physics. Prior works address this limitation with large-scale multiple physics pretraining followed by fine-tuning, but this still requires examples from the new dynamics, falling short of true zero-shot generalization. In this work, we propose a method to enhance generalization at test time, i.e., without modifying pretrained weights. Building on DISCO, which provides a dictionary of neural operators trained across different dynamics, we introduce a neural operator splitting strategy that, at test time, searches over compositions of training operators to approximate unseen dynamics. On challenging out-of-distribution tasks including parameter extrapolation and novel combinations of physics phenomena, our approach achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot generalization results, while being able to recover the underlying PDE parameters. These results underscore test-time computation as a key avenue for building flexible, compositional, and generalizable neural operators.",

Traditional subset selection methods, including those based on Determinantal Point Processes (DPP), focus on maximizing diversity but assume that selected data batches are always available error-free. This presumption prohibits their use under partial storage outage, imperfect communication, and stochastic access failures. Furthermore, we show that the original formulation collapses under such conditions. To address this gap, we introduce ProbDPP, a novel reliability-aware implementation of k-DPP that accounts for probabilistic data access by recasting the objective function with a regularization term that remains well-posed and decomposes into a geometric diversity term and unreliability cost. The resulting objective facilitates robust selection of diverse data batches under uncertainty. Furthermore, we frame this reliability-aware diversity maximization as a combinatorial semi-bandit problem and propose a UCB-style algorithm to efficiently learn the unknown reliability online. Theoretical analysis provides regret bounds for the proposed approach, ensuring performance guarantees.",

Most existing ECTS methods assume that the time-dependent decision costs governing the learning objective are known, fixed, and correctly specified. In practice, however, these costs are often uncertain and may change over time, leading to mismatches between training-time and deployment-time objectives. In this paper, we study ECTS under two practically relevant forms of cost non-stationarity: drift in the balance between misclassification and decision delay costs, and stochastic realizations of decision costs that deviate from the nominal training-time model. To address these challenges, we revisit representative ECTS approaches and adapt them to an online learning setting. Focusing on separable methods, we update only the triggering model during deployment, while keeping the classifier fixed. We propose several online adaptations and baselines, including bandit-based and RL-based approaches, and conduct controlled experiments on synthetic data to systematically evaluate robustness under cost non-stationarity. Our results demonstrate that online learning can effectively improve the robustness of ECTS methods to cost drift, with RL-based strategies exhibiting strong and stable performance across varying cost regimes.",

Recent efforts pursue this in different ways, such as RL fine-tuning to elicit long CoT or scaling latent reasoning through architectural recurrence. This makes reasoning length an important scaling knob. In this work, we identify a novel phenomenon (both theoretically and experimentally): under outcome-only supervision, out-of-distribution (OOD) performance can continue improving as training-time reasoning length (e.g., the token budget in RL, or the loop count in looped Transformers) increases, even after in-distribution (ID) performance has saturated. This suggests that robustness may require a larger budget than ID validation alone would indicate. We provide theoretical explanations via two mechanisms: (i) self-iteration can induce a stronger inductive bias in the hypothesis class, reshaping ID-optimal solutions in ways that improve OOD generalization; and (ii) when shortcut solutions that work for ID samples but not for OOD samples persist in the hypothesis class, regularization can reduce the learned solution's reliance on these shortcuts as the number of self-iterations increases. We complement the theory with empirical evidence from two realizations of scaling training-time reasoning length: increasing the number of loops in looped Transformers on a synthetic task, and increasing token budgets during RL fine-tuning of LLMs on mathematical reasoning.",

While sparse and low-rank structures naturally trade off capacity and performance, existing approaches often rely on heuristic designs that ignore layer and matrix heterogeneity or require model-specific architectural modifications. We propose SALAAD, a plug-and-play framework applicable to different model architectures that induces sparse and low-rank structures during training. By formulating structured weight learning under an augmented Lagrangian framework and introducing an adaptive controller that dynamically balances the training loss and structural constraints, SALAAD preserves the stability of standard training dynamics while enabling explicit control over the evolution of effective model capacity during training. Experiments across model scales show that SALAAD substantially reduces memory consumption during deployment while achieving performance comparable to ad-hoc methods. Moreover, a single training run yields a continuous spectrum of model capacities, enabling smooth and elastic deployment across diverse memory budgets without the need for retraining.",

In practice, Thompson Sampling (TS) is often initialized with a uniform Beta(1,1) prior, implicitly assuming a 50% success rate for unseen items. When true base rates are far lower, this optimistic prior systematically over-allocates to weak items. The impact is amplified by batched policy updates and pipeline latency: for hours, newly launched items can remain effectively \"no data,\" so the prior dominates allocation before feedback is incorporated. We propose Dynamic Prior Thompson Sampling, a prior design that directly controls the probability that a new arm outcompetes the incumbent winner. Our key contribution is a closed-form quadratic solution for the prior mean that enforces P(X_j > Y_k) = epsilon at introduction time, making exploration intensity predictable and tunable while preserving TS Bayesian updates. Across Monte Carlo validation, offline batched simulations, and a large-scale online experiment on a thumbnail personalization system serving millions of users, dynamic priors deliver precise exploration control and improved efficiency versus a uniform-prior baseline.",

This paper compares the transfer learning enabled model update strategies including ensemble transfer learning (ETL), all-layers transfer learning (ALTL), and last-layer transfer learning (LLTL) for updating the failed feedforward artificial neural network (ANN) model. The flue gas differential pressure across the air preheater unit installed in a 660 MW thermal power plant is analyzed as a case study since it mimics the batch processes due to load cycling in the power plant. Updating the failed ANN model by three transfer learning techniques reveals that ETL provides relatively higher predictive accuracy for the batch size of 5 days than those of LLTL and ALTL. However, ALTL is found to be suitable for effective update of the model trained on large batch size (8 days). A mixed trend is observed for computational requirement (hyperparameter tuning and model training) of model update techniques for different batch sizes. These fundamental and empiric insights obtained from the batch process-based industrial case study can assist the MLOps practitioners in adapting the failed models to data drifts for the accurate monitoring of industrial processes.",

In this paper, we propose an interactive agentic framework to systematically extract and quantify the knowledge of LLMs. Our method includes four adaptive exploration policies to probe knowledge at different granularities. To ensure the quality of extracted knowledge, we introduce a three-stage knowledge processing pipeline that combines vector-based filtering to remove exact duplicates, LLM-based adjudication to resolve ambiguous semantic overlaps, and domain-relevance auditing to retain valid knowledge units. Through extensive experiments, we find that recursive taxonomy is the most effective exploration strategy. We also observe a clear knowledge scaling law, where larger models consistently extract more knowledge. In addition, we identify a Pass@1-versus-Pass@k trade-off: domain-specialized models achieve higher initial accuracy but degrade rapidly, while general-purpose models maintain stable performance during extended extraction. Finally, our results show that differences in training data composition lead to distinct and measurable knowledge profiles across model families.",

By formalizing the connection between Zipfian statistics and random matrix theory, we prove that the power-law decay in the singular value spectra of embeddings is a fundamental requisite for semantic encoding. We derive theoretical bounds showing that uniform quantization introduces a noise floor that disproportionately truncates this spectral tail, which induces spectral flattening and a strictly provable increase in the stable rank of representations. Empirical validation across diverse architectures including GPT-2 and TinyLlama corroborates that this geometric degradation precipitates representational collapse.

To address this limitation, we introduce FoSTA (Forest-guided Semantic Transport Alignment), a scalable alignment framework that leverages forest-induced geometry to denoise intra-domain structure and recover task-relevant manifolds prior to alignment. FoSTA builds semantic representations directly from label-informed forest affinities and aligns them via fast, hierarchical semantic transport, capturing meaningful cross-domain relationships.

We close this gap by introducing Random Wavelet Features (RWF), a framework that constructs scalable, non-stationary kernel approximations by sampling from wavelet families. By harnessing the inherent localization and multi-resolution structure of wavelets, RWF generates an explicit feature map that captures complex, input-dependent patterns. Our framework provides a principled way to generalize RFF to the non-stationary setting and comes with a comprehensive theoretical analysis, including positive definiteness, unbiasedness, and uniform convergence guarantees. We demonstrate empirically on a range of challenging synthetic and real-world datasets that RWF outperforms stationary random features and offers a compelling accuracy-efficiency trade-off against more complex models, unlocking scalable and expressive kernel methods for a broad class of real-world non-stationary problems.",

Using World Health Organization hemoglobin thresholds, we defined anemia status for children aged 6-59 months and formulated a binary classification task by grouping all anemia severities as \\emph{anemic} versus \\emph{not anemic}. We analyzed Nepal Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS 2022) microdata comprising 1,855 children and initially considered 48 candidate features spanning demographic, socioeconomic, maternal, and child health characteristics. To obtain a stable and substantiated feature set, we applied four features selection techniques (Chi-square, mutual information, point-biserial correlation, and Boruta) and prioritized features supported by multi-method consensus. Five features: child age, recent fever, household size, maternal anemia, and parasite deworming were consistently selected by all methods, while amenorrhea, ethnicity indicators, and provinces were frequently retained. We then compared eight traditional machine learning classifiers (LR, KNN, DT, RF, XGBoost, SVM, NB, LDA) with two deep learning models (DNN and TabNet) using standard evaluation metrics, emphasizing F1-score and recall due to class imbalance. Among all models, logistic regression attained the best recall (0.701) and the highest F1-score (0.649), while DNN achieved the highest accuracy (0.709), and SVM yielded the strongest discrimination with the highest AUC (0.736). Overall, the results indicate that both machine learning and deep learning models can provide competitive anemia prediction and the interpretable features such as child age, infection proxy, maternal anemia, and deworming history are central for risk stratification and public health screening in Nepal.",

Despite extensive empirical observations, a fundamental understanding of CoT is lacking--what constitutes faithful CoT reasoning, and how unfaithfulness emerges from autoregressive training. We study these questions using well-controlled synthetic experiments, training small transformers on noisy data to solve modular arithmetic expressions step by step, a task we term Arithmetic Expression Reasoning. We find that models can learn faithful reasoning that causally follows the underlying arithmetic rules, but only when the training noise is below a critical threshold, a phenomenon attributable to simplicity bias. At higher noise levels, training dynamics exhibit a transition from faithful stepwise reasoning to unfaithful skip-step reasoning via an intermediate mixed mode characterized by a transient increase in prediction entropy. Mechanistic analysis reveals that models learn to encode internal uncertainty by resolving inconsistent reasoning steps, which suggests the emergence of implicit self-verification from autoregressive training.",

We propose SFMP, a search-free and hardware-friendly mixed-precision quantization framework for large language models. The framework is built upon four novel ideas: Fractional bit-width, which extends integer bit-width for weight matrix to fractional value and transforms discrete precision allocation as a continuous problem; 2)Block-wise mixed-precision, enabling fine-grained precision within weight matrices while remaining hardware-friendly; 3)Row-column weight reordering, which aggregates salient weights via row and column reordering, incurring only a small activation reordering overhead during inference; 4)Unified GEMM kernel, which supports mixed-precision GEMM at arbitrary average bit-width. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SFMP outperforms state-of-the-art layer-wise mixed-precision methods under the same memory constraints, while significantly reducing quantization cost and improving inference efficiency.

However, in real-world service-oriented deployments, data generated by heterogeneous users, devices, and application scenarios are inherently non-IID. This severe data heterogeneity critically undermines the convergence stability, generalization ability, and ultimately the quality of service delivered by the global model. To address this challenge, we propose FLood, a novel FL framework inspired by out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. FLood dynamically counteracts the adverse effects of heterogeneity through a dual-weighting mechanism that jointly governs local training and global aggregation. At the client level, it adaptively reweights the supervised loss by upweighting pseudo-OOD samples, thereby encouraging more robust learning from distributionally misaligned or challenging data. At the server level, it refines model aggregation by weighting client contributions according to their OOD confidence scores, prioritizing updates from clients with higher in-distribution consistency and enhancing the global model's robustness and convergence stability. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks under diverse non-IID settings demonstrate that FLood consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FL methods in both accuracy and generalization. Furthermore, FLood functions as an orthogonal plug-in module: it seamlessly integrates with existing FL algorithms to boost their performance under heterogeneity without modifying their core optimization logic. These properties make FLood a practical and scalable solution for deploying reliable intelligent services in real-world federated environments.",

Despite sharing base model weights, each agent independently builds and stores its own KV cache for the same long, tool-augmented trajectories, incurring substantial memory and compute overhead. Existing KV cache sharing methods largely overlook this multi-LoRA setting. We observe that, across agents, cache differences are dominated by adapter outputs, while activations from the shared pretrained backbone remain highly similar. Based on this observation, we propose LRAgent, a KV cache sharing framework for multi-LoRA agents that decomposes the cache into a shared base component from the pretrained weights and an adapter-dependent component from LoRA weights. LRAgent reduces memory overhead by sharing the base component and storing the adapter component in its inherent low-rank form, and further reduces compute overhead, enabled by shared-$A$ multi-LoRA architectures, by also sharing the low-rank cache and avoiding redundant computations for contexts already processed by other agents. To efficiently reconstruct adapter contributions at runtime, we introduce Flash-LoRA-Attention, a kernel that reorders attention computation to avoid materializing the low-rank cache to full dimension. LRAgent achieves throughput and time-to-first-token latency close to fully shared caching, while preserving accuracy near the non-shared caching baseline across agentic question-answering benchmarks.",

However, SFT is often optimized in isolation to maximize SFT performance alone. We show that, after identical RL training, models initialized from stronger SFT checkpoints can significantly underperform those initialized from weaker ones. We attribute this to a mismatch typical in current SFT-RL pipelines: the distribution that generates the offline SFT data can differ substantially from the policy optimized during online RL, which learns from its own rollouts. We propose PEAR (Policy Evaluation-inspired Algorithm for Offline Learning Loss Re-weighting), an SFT-stage method that corrects this mismatch and better prepares the model for RL. PEAR uses importance sampling to reweight the SFT loss, with three variants operating at the token, block, and sequence levels. It can be used to augment standard SFT objectives and incurs little additional training overhead once probabilities for the offline data are collected. We conduct controlled experiments on verifiable reasoning games and mathematical reasoning tasks on Qwen 2.5 and 3 and DeepSeek-distilled models. PEAR consistently improves post-RL performance over canonical SFT, with pass at 8 gains up to a 14.6 percent on AIME2025. Our results suggest that PEAR is an effective step toward more holistic LLM post-training by designing and evaluating SFT with downstream RL in mind rather than in isolation.",

Importantly, unlike other structured domains, weight-space learning targets maps operating on both weight and function spaces, making expressivity analysis particularly subtle. While a few prior works provide partial expressivity results, a comprehensive characterization is still missing. In this work, we address this gap by developing a systematic theory for expressivity of weight-space networks. We first prove that all prominent permutation-equivariant networks are equivalent in expressive power. We then establish universality in both weight- and function-space settings under mild, natural assumptions on the input weights, and characterize the edge-case regimes where universality no longer holds.

In such settings, an adversary that compromises a small number of edge devices may inject counterfeit nodes (e.g., rogue sensors, virtualized endpoints, or spoofed substations) to bias downstream decisions while evading topology- and homophily-based sanitization. This paper formulates deployment-oriented node-injection attacks under constrained resources and proposes the \\emph{Single-Edge Graph Injection Attack} (SEGIA), in which each injected node attaches to the operational graph through a single edge. SEGIA integrates a pruned SGC surrogate, multi-hop neighborhood sampling, and reverse graph convolution-based feature synthesis with a similarity-regularized objective to preserve local homophily and survive edge pruning. Theoretical analysis and extensive evaluations across datasets and defenses show at least $25\\%$ higher attack success than representative baselines under substantially smaller edge budgets. These results indicate a system-level risk in industrial GNN deployments and motivate lightweight admission validation and neighborhood-consistency monitoring.",

Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) enables such adaptation with minimal overhead, while federated LoRA allows web service providers to fine-tune shared models without data sharing. However, in privacy-sensitive deployments, clients inject varying levels of differential privacy (DP) noise, creating privacy heterogeneity that misaligns individual incentives and global performance. In this paper, we propose WinFLoRA, a privacy-heterogeneous federated LoRA that utilizes aggregation weights as incentives with noise awareness. Specifically, the noises from clients are estimated based on the uploaded LoRA adapters. A larger weight indicates greater influence on the global model and better downstream task performance, rewarding lower-noise contributions. By up-weighting low-noise updates, WinFLoRA improves global accuracy while accommodating clients' heterogeneous privacy requirements. Consequently, WinFLoRA aligns heterogeneous client utility in terms of privacy and downstream performance with global model objectives without third-party involvement. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that across multiple LLMs and datasets, WinFLoRA achieves up to 52.58% higher global accuracy and up to 2.56x client utility than state-of-the-art benchmarks.

Existing preference optimization methods, including Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), collapse feedback into a single scalar reward, fixing one balance among objectives and preventing traversal of the Pareto front. Recent work by Ortiz-Jimenez et al. (2023) showed that fine-tuning can be viewed in a model's tangent space, where linearized updates act as additive vectors that can be composed to jointly perform well on multiple tasks. Building on this formulation, we extend this idea to preference alignment and propose Tangent-Space Direct Preference Optimization (TS-DPO), which performs DPO within this locally linear regime to learn per-objective update directions. These directions can be linearly combined at inference to generate user-specified behaviors without additional optimization. Evaluated on the helpfulness-verbosity trade-off using the HelpSteer and UltraFeedback datasets, TS-DPO achieves broader Pareto-optimal coverage and smoother preference control than scalarized DPO. Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) further shows that tangent-space training amplifies canonical directions aligned with distinct preferences, improving disentanglement.",

These quantities yield computable diagnostics and stability-oriented regularization principles. Synthetic experiments and controlled studies on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 confirm that modest spectral regularization substantially improves attribution stability even when global spectral summaries change little.

Yet hard nearest-neighbor assignments are non-differentiable and are typically optimized with heuristic straight-through estimators, which couple the update step size to the quantization gap and train each code in isolation, leading to unstable gradients and severe codebook under-utilization at scale. In this paper, we introduce GRIT-VQ (Generalized Radius and Integrated Transform-Vector Quantization), a unified surrogate framework that keeps hard assignments in the forward pass while making VQ fully differentiable. GRIT-VQ replaces the straight-through estimator with a radius-based update that moves latents along the quantization direction with a controllable, geometry-aware step, and applies a data-agnostic integrated transform to the codebook so that all codes are updated through shared parameters instead of independently. Our theoretical analysis clarifies the fundamental optimization dynamics introduced by GRIT-VQ, establishing conditions for stable gradient flow, coordinated codebook evolution, and reliable avoidance of collapse across a broad family of quantizers. Across image reconstruction, image generation, and recommendation tokenization benchmarks, GRIT-VQ consistently improves reconstruction error, generative quality, and recommendation accuracy while substantially increasing codebook utilization compared to existing VQ variants.",

Standard PPO relies on surrogate objectives defined via importance ratios, which require evaluating policy likelihood that is typically straightforward when the policy is modeled as a Gaussian distribution. However, extending PPO to more expressive, high-capacity policy models such as continuous normalizing flows (CNFs), also known as flow-matching models, is challenging because likelihood evaluation along the full flow trajectory is computationally expensive and often numerically unstable. To resolve this issue, we propose PolicyFlow, a novel on-policy CNF-based reinforcement learning algorithm that integrates expressive CNF policies with PPO-style objectives without requiring likelihood evaluation along the full flow path. PolicyFlow approximates importance ratios using velocity field variations along a simple interpolation path, reducing computational overhead without compromising training stability. To further prevent mode collapse and further encourage diverse behaviors, we propose the Brownian Regularizer, an implicit policy entropy regularizer inspired by Brownian motion, which is conceptually elegant and computationally lightweight. Experiments on diverse tasks across various environments including MultiGoal, PointMaze, IsaacLab and MuJoCo Playground show that PolicyFlow achieves competitive or superior performance compared to PPO using Gaussian policies and flow-based baselines including FPO and DPPO. Notably, results on MultiGoal highlight PolicyFlow's ability to capture richer multimodal action distributions.",

While deep learning (DL) has been increasingly adopted in EPF to capture complex and nonlinear price dynamics, several important gaps persist: (i) limited attention to multi-day horizons beyond day-ahead forecasting, (ii) insufficient exploration of state-of-the-art (SOTA) time series DL models, and (iii) a predominant reliance on aggregated horizon-level evaluation that obscures time-of-day forecasting variation. To address these gaps, we propose a novel EPF framework that extends the forecast horizon to multi-day-ahead by systematically building forecasting models that leverage benchmarked SOTA time series DL models. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation to analyse time-of-day forecasting performance by integrating model assessment at intraday interval levels across all five regions in the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM). The results show that no single model consistently dominates across regions, metrics, and horizons. Overall, standard DL models deliver superior performance in most regions, while SOTA time series DL models demonstrate greater robustness to forecast horizon extension. Intraday interval-level evaluation reveals pronounced diurnal error patterns, indicating that absolute errors peak during the evening ramp, relative errors inflate during midday negative-price regimes, and directional accuracy degrades during periods of frequent trend changes. These findings suggest that future research on DL-based EPF can benefit from enriched feature representations and modelling strategies that enhance longer-term forecasting robustness while maintaining sensitivity to intraday volatility and structural price dynamics.",

However, real intermediate domains are often unavailable or ineffective, necessitating the synthesis of intermediate samples. Flow-based models have recently been used for this purpose by interpolating between source and target distributions; however, their training typically relies on sample-based log-likelihood estimation, which can discard useful information and thus degrade GDA performance. The key to addressing this limitation is constructing the intermediate domains via samples directly. To this end, we propose an Entropy-regularized Semi-dual Unbalanced Optimal Transport (E-SUOT) framework to construct intermediate domains. Specifically, we reformulate flow-based GDA as a Lagrangian dual problem and derive an equivalent semi-dual objective that circumvents the need for likelihood estimation. However, the dual problem leads to an unstable min-max training procedure. To alleviate this issue, we further introduce entropy regularization to convert it into a more stable alternative optimization procedure. Based on this, we propose a novel GDA training framework and provide theoretical analysis in terms of stability and generalization. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the efficacy of the E-SUOT framework.",

        "abstract": "Diffusion models (DMs) have shown promise for Time-Series Data Imputation (TSDI); however, their performance remains inconsistent in complex scenarios. We attribute this to two primary obstacles: (1) non-stationary temporal dynamics, which can bias the inference trajectory and lead to outlier-sensitive imputations; and (2) objective inconsistency, since imputation favors accurate pointwise recovery whereas DMs are inherently trained to generate diverse samples. To better understand these issues, we analyze DM-based TSDI process through a proximal-operator perspective and uncover that an implicit Wasserstein distance regularization inherent in the process hinders the model's ability to counteract non-stationarity and dissipative regularizer, thereby amplifying diversity at the expense of fidelity. Building on this insight, we propose a novel framework called SPIRIT (Semi-Proximal Transport Regularized time-series Imputation). Specifically, we introduce entropy-induced Bregman divergence to relax the mass preserving constraint in the Wasserstein distance, formulate the semi-proximal transport (SPT) discrepancy, and theoretically prove the robustness of SPT against non-stationarity. Subsequently, we remove the dissipative structure and derive the complete SPIRIT workflow, with SPT serving as the proximal operator. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SPIRIT approach.",

Their abilities to maintain internal memory and adapt quickly to unseen scenarios have offered them unparalleled performance when compared to non-recurrent counterparts. However, until today, the underlying mechanisms for their superior generalization and robustness performance remain poorly understood. In this study, by analyzing the hidden state domain of recurrent policies learned over a diverse set of training methods, model architectures, and tasks, we find that stable cyclic structures consistently emerge during interaction with the environment. Such cyclic structures share a remarkable similarity with \\textit{limit cycles} in dynamical system analysis, if we consider the policy and the environment as a joint hybrid dynamical system. Moreover, we uncover that the geometry of such limit cycles also has a structured correspondence with the policies' behaviors. These findings offer new perspectives to explain many nice properties of recurrent policies: the emergence of limit cycles stabilizes both the policies' internal memory and the task-relevant environmental states, while suppressing nuisance variability arising from environmental uncertainty; the geometry of limit cycles also encodes relational structures of behaviors, facilitating easier skill adaptation when facing non-stationary environments.",

While such representations are intuitive for privacy, they pose challenges for machine learning, which typically treats non-original values as new categories or as missing, thereby discarding generalization semantics. For learning from such tabular data, we propose novel data transformation strategies that account for heterogeneous anonymization and evaluate them alongside standard imputation and LLM-based approaches. We employ multiple datasets, privacy configurations, and deployment scenarios, demonstrating that our method reliably regains utility. Our results show that generalized values are preferable to pure suppression, that the best data preparation strategy depends on the scenario, and that consistent data representations are crucial for maintaining downstream utility.

Current methods often exhibit trade-offs among these metrics, as optimizing one generally degrades at least one of the others. Addressing this trade-off remains a central challenge in algorithm design. While GaLore enables memory-efficient training by updating gradients in a low-rank subspace, it incurs a comparable extra training time cost due to the Singular Value Decomposition(SVD) process on gradients. In this paper, we propose Lotus, a method that resolves this trade-off by simply modifying the projection process. We propose a criterion that quantifies the displacement of the unit gradient to enable efficient transitions between low-rank gradient subspaces. Experimental results indicate that Lotus is the most efficient method, achieving a 30% reduction in training time and a 40% decrease in memory consumption for gradient and optimizer states. Additionally, it outperforms the baseline method in both pre-training and fine-tuning tasks.",

This problem can be addressed by allowing limited online interactions to selectively refine uncertain regions of the learned value function, which is referred to as Active Reinforcement Learning (ActiveRL). While there has been good empirical success, no theoretical analysis is available in the literature. We fill this gap by developing a rigorous sample-complexity analysis of ActiveRL through the lens of Gaussian Process (GP) uncertainty modeling. In this respect, we propose an algorithm and using GP concentration inequalities and information-gain bounds, we derive high-probability guarantees showing that an $\\epsilon$-optimal policy can be learned with ${\\mathcal{O}}(1/\\epsilon^2)$ active transitions, improving upon the $\\Omega(1/\\epsilon^2(1-\\gamma)^4)$ rate of purely offline methods. Our results reveal that ActiveRL achieves near-optimal information efficiency, that is, guided uncertainty reduction leads to accelerated value-function convergence with minimal online data. Our analysis builds on GP concentration inequalities and information-gain bounds, bridging Bayesian nonparametric regression and reinforcement learning theories. We conduct several experiments to validate the algorithm and theoretical findings.",

The vanilla KD proposed by Hinton et al. has been the dominant approach in logit-based distillation and demonstrates compelling performance. However, it only performs sample-wise probability alignment between teacher and student's predictions, lacking an mechanism for class-wise comparison. Besides, vanilla KD imposes no structural constraint on the probability space. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective methodology, bilateral contrastive knowledge distillation (BicKD). This approach introduces a novel bilateral contrastive loss, which intensifies the orthogonality among different class generalization spaces while preserving consistency within the same class. The bilateral formulation enables explicit comparison of both sample-wise and class-wise prediction patterns between teacher and student. By emphasizing probabilistic orthogonality, BicKD further regularizes the geometric structure of the predictive distribution. Extensive experiments show that our BicKD method enhances knowledge transfer, and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art knowledge distillation techniques across various model architectures and benchmarks.",

In particular, we show that the alignment between Kronecker adapters and full fine-tuning depends on component configurations.

Model-based reinforcement learning offers a promising path to improved sample efficiency through world models, but standard monolithic architectures struggle to capture diverse task dynamics, resulting in poor reconstruction and prediction accuracy. We introduce Mixture-of-World Models (MoW), a scalable architecture that combines modular variational autoencoders for task-adaptive visual compression, a hybrid Transformer-based dynamics model with task-conditioned experts and a shared backbone, and a gradient-based task clustering strategy for efficient parameter allocation. On the Atari 100k benchmark, a single MoW agent trained once on 26 Atari games achieves a mean human-normalized score of 110.4%, competitive with the score of 114.2% achieved by STORM, an ensemble of 26 task-specific models, while using 50% fewer parameters. On Meta-World, MoW achieves a 74.5% average success rate within 300 thousand environment steps, establishing a new state of the art.

This work introduces an Agentic AI system for intent-driven autonomous networks, structured around three specialized agents. A supervisory interpreter agent, powered by language models, performs both lexical parsing of intents into executable optimization templates and cognitive refinement based on feedback, constraint feasibility, and evolving network conditions. An optimizer agent converts these templates into tractable optimization problems, analyzes trade-offs, and derives preferences across objectives. Lastly, a preference-driven controller agent, based on multi-objective reinforcement learning, leverages these preferences to operate near the Pareto frontier of network performance that best satisfies the original intent. Collectively, these agents enable networks to autonomously interpret, reason over, adapt to, and act upon diverse intents and network conditions in a scalable manner.",

This enables posterior inference that accounts for variability of the full network while retaining the low computational cost of inference of a standard BLL. We show that our method yields posterior variances that are provably greater or equal to those of a standard BLL, correcting its tendency to underestimate epistemic uncertainty. To further reduce computational cost, we introduce a uniform subsampling scheme for estimating the projection matrix and for posterior inference. We derive approximation bounds for both types of sub-sampling. Empirical evaluations on UCI regression, contextual bandits, image classification, and out-of-distribution detection tasks in image and tabular datasets, demonstrate improved calibration and uncertainty estimates compared to standard BLLs and competitive baselines, while reducing computational cost.",

These patterns persist across models and training stages, suggesting they reflect intrinsic properties of reasoning failure rather than superficial noise. To formalize this observation, we introduce the Entropy Dynamics Instability Score (\\textbf{EDIS}), a trajectory-level metric quantifying instability in entropy evolution.

        "abstract": "Data attribution, tracing a model's prediction back to specific training data, is an important tool for interpreting sophisticated AI models. The widely used TRAK algorithm addresses this challenge by first approximating the underlying model with a kernel machine and then leveraging techniques developed for approximating the leave-one-out (ALO) risk. Despite its strong empirical performance, the theoretical conditions under which the TRAK approximations are accurate as well as the regimes in which they break down remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we provide a theoretical analysis of the TRAK algorithm, characterizing its performance and quantifying the errors introduced by the approximations on which the method relies. We show that although the approximations incur significant errors, TRAK's estimated influence remains highly correlated with the original influence and therefore largely preserves the relative ranking of data points. We corroborate our theoretical results through extensive simulations and empirical studies.",

        "abstract": "Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising method for interpreting neural network representations by decomposing activations into sparse combinations of dictionary atoms. However, SAEs assume that features combine additively through linear reconstruction, an assumption that cannot capture compositional structure: linear models cannot distinguish whether \"Starbucks\" arises from the composition of \"star\" and \"coffee\" features or merely their co-occurrence. This forces SAEs to allocate monolithic features for compound concepts rather than decomposing them into interpretable constituents. We introduce PolySAE, which extends the SAE decoder with higher-order terms to model feature interactions while preserving the linear encoder essential for interpretability. Through low-rank tensor factorization on a shared projection subspace, PolySAE captures pairwise and triple feature interactions with small parameter overhead (3% on GPT2). Across four language models and three SAE variants, PolySAE achieves an average improvement of approximately 8% in probing F1 while maintaining comparable reconstruction error, and produces 2-10$\\times$ larger Wasserstein distances between class-conditional feature distributions. Critically, learned interaction weights exhibit negligible correlation with co-occurrence frequency ($r = 0.06$ vs. $r = 0.82$ for SAE feature covariance), suggesting that polynomial terms capture compositional structure, such as morphological binding and phrasal composition, largely independent of surface statistics.",

Existing literature either focuses only on first-order stationary points for minimax problems or on SOSP for classical stochastic minimization problems.

Specifically, we propose a purely first-order method that combines a nested gradient descent--ascent scheme with SPIDER-style variance reduction and Gaussian perturbations to ensure privacy. A key technical device is a block-wise ($q$-period) analysis that controls the accumulation of stochastic variance and privacy noise without summing over the full iteration horizon, yielding a unified treatment of both empirical-risk and population formulations.

While the most effective and popular estimators leverage the paired sampling heuristic to reduce estimation error, the theoretical mechanism driving this improvement has remained opaque. In this work, we provide an elegant and fundamental justification for paired sampling: we prove that the Shapley value depends exclusively on the odd component of the set function, and that paired sampling orthogonalizes the regression objective to filter out the irrelevant even component. Leveraging this insight, we propose OddSHAP, a novel consistent estimator that performs polynomial regression solely on the odd subspace. By utilizing the Fourier basis to isolate this subspace and employing a proxy model to identify high-impact interactions, OddSHAP overcomes the combinatorial explosion of higher-order approximations. Through an extensive benchmark evaluation, we find that OddSHAP achieves state-of-the-art estimation accuracy.",

Current mixed-precision training approaches either apply uniform precision to all GEMM operations or rely on heuristic-based methods that fail to generalize during training, leading to suboptimal convergence and instability. To address these challenges, this paper introduces SNIP, a fine-grained adaptive mixed-precision training framework for LLM pretraining that supports subbyte precision. SNIP periodically collects statistics on activations, gradients, and optimizer states to assess the precision loss impact on model quality. We define two key metrics: loss divergence in the forward pass, caused by quantization-induced increases in training loss, and weight divergence in the backward pass, which measures error propagation through gradients affecting model updates. These metrics guide an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem that systematically optimizes layerwise precision to minimize overall quality loss while meeting efficiency targets. Experiments on 1B, 3B, 7B and 70B Llama-like models demonstrate that SNIP consistently outperforms existing baselines, reducing FLOPs by up to 80% while preserving model quality across different model sizes and training phases with minimal computational overhead.",

Speculative sampling accelerates inference, with efficiency improving as the acceptance rate between draft and target models increases. Yet recent work reveals a fundamental trade-off: higher watermark strength reduces acceptance, preventing their simultaneous achievement. We revisit this trade-off and show it is not absolute. We introduce a quantitative measure of watermark strength that governs statistical detectability and is maximized when tokens are deterministic functions of pseudorandom numbers. Using this measure, we fully characterize the trade-off as a constrained optimization problem and derive explicit Pareto curves for two existing watermarking schemes. Finally, we introduce a principled mechanism that injects pseudorandomness into draft-token acceptance, ensuring maximal watermark strength while maintaining speculative sampling efficiency. Experiments further show that this approach improves detectability without sacrificing efficiency. Our findings uncover a principle that unites speculative sampling and watermarking, paving the way for their efficient and practical deployment.",

Our characterization of $\\delta_{\\text{NN}}$ opens the way to study the dependence of learning dynamics on the network architecture and training algorithm. The threshold $\\delta_{\\text{NN}}$ is determined by the following scenario. Training first visits points for which the gradient of the empirical risk is large and learns the directions spanned by these gradients. Then the gradient becomes smaller and the dynamics becomes dominated by negative directions of the Hessian.

To address this issue, a class of regularization methods that enforce consistency between imputed and fully observed data has emerged as a promising approach for improving model generalization, particularly in partially observed settings. We refer to this class of methods as Measure Consistency Regularization (MCR). Despite its empirical success in various applications, such as image inpainting, data imputation and semi-supervised learning, a fundamental understanding of the theoretical underpinnings of MCR remains limited. This paper bridges this gap by offering theoretical insights into why, when, and how MCR enhances imputation quality under partial observability, viewed through the lens of neural network distance. Our theoretical analysis identifies the term responsible for MCR's generalization advantage and extends to the imperfect training regime, demonstrating that this advantage is not always guaranteed. Guided by these insights, we propose a novel training protocol that monitors the duality gap to determine an early stopping point that preserves the generalization benefit. We then provide detailed empirical evidence to support our theoretical claims and to show the effectiveness and accuracy of our proposed stopping condition. We further provide a set of real-world data simulations to show the versatility of MCR under different model architectures designed for different data sources.",

        "abstract": "Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) plays a central role in the performance of deep learning models, yet remains computationally expensive and difficult to interpret, particularly for time-series forecasting. While Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a standard approach, it typically treats tuning tasks independently and provides limited insight into its decisions. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities to incorporate structured prior knowledge and reasoning into optimization pipelines. We introduce LLM-AutoOpt, a hybrid HPO framework that combines BO with LLM-based contextual reasoning. The framework encodes dataset meta-features, model descriptions, historical optimization outcomes, and target objectives as structured meta-knowledge within LLM prompts, using BO to initialize the search and mitigate cold-start effects. This design enables context-aware and stable hyperparameter refinement while exposing the reasoning behind optimization decisions. Experiments on a multivariate time series forecasting benchmark demonstrate that LLM-AutoOpt achieves improved predictive performance and more interpretable optimization behavior compared to BO and LLM baselines without meta-knowledge.",

We focus on a tabular finite-horizon MDP and adopt a phased learning framework. In each learning phase, multiple agents independently interact with the environment. More specifically, in each learning phase, each agent is assigned a policy, executes it, and observes the resulting trajectory. Our primary goal is to characterize the tradeoff between the number of learning phases and the number of agents, especially when the number of learning phases is small. Our results identify a sharp transition governed by the horizon $H$. When the number of learning phases equals $H$, we present a computationally efficient algorithm that uses only $\\tilde{O}(S^6 H^6 A / \\epsilon^2)$ agents to obtain an $\\epsilon$ approximation of the dynamics (i.e., yields an $\\epsilon$-optimal policy for any reward function). We complement our algorithm with a lower bound showing that any algorithm restricted to $\\rho < H$ phases requires at least $A^{H/\\rho}$ agents to achieve constant accuracy. Thus, we show that it is essential to have an order of $H$ learning phases if we limit the number of agents to be polynomial.",

This work offers a novel perspective by treating topology and attributes as structurally distinct but interacting components. We introduce an algebraic approach that combines a graph's topology with the probability distribution of node attributes, resulting in topology-influenced distributions. First, we develop a categorical framework to formalize how a node perceives the graph's topology. We then quantify this point of view and integrate it with the distribution of node attributes to capture topological effects. We interpret these topology-conditioned distributions as approximations of the posteriors $P(\\cdot \\mid v)$ and $P(\\cdot \\mid \\mathcal{G})$. We further establish a principled sufficiency condition by showing that, on complete graphs, where topology carries no informative structure, our construction recovers the original attribute distribution. To evaluate our approach, we introduce an intentionally simple testbed model, $\\textbf{ID}$, and use unsupervised graph anomaly detection as a probing task.",

In an effort to improve performance, a gated attention model that leverages a gating mechanism within the multi-head self-attention has recently been proposed as a promising alternative. Gated attention has been empirically demonstrated to increase the expressiveness of low-rank mapping in standard attention and even to eliminate the attention sink phenomenon. Despite its efficacy, a clear theoretical understanding of gated attention's benefits remains lacking in the literature. To close this gap, we rigorously show that each entry in a gated attention matrix or a multi-head self-attention matrix can be written as a hierarchical mixture of experts. By recasting learning as an expert estimation problem, we demonstrate that gated attention is more sample-efficient than multi-head self-attention. In particular, while the former needs only a polynomial number of data points to estimate an expert, the latter requires exponentially many data points to achieve the same estimation error. Furthermore, our analysis also provides a theoretical justification for why gated attention yields higher performance when a gate is placed at the output of the scaled dot product attention or the value map rather than at other positions in the multi-head self-attention architecture.",

In this regime, the \"Central Flow\", recently proposed in Cohen et al. (2025), provides an accurate ODE approximation to the GD dynamics over many architectures. In this work, we propose Rod Flow, an alternative ODE approximation, which carries the following advantages: (1) it rests on a principled derivation stemming from a physical picture of GD iterates as an extended one-dimensional object -- a \"rod\"; (2) it better captures GD dynamics for simple toy examples and matches the accuracy of Central Flow for representative neural network architectures, and (3) is explicit and cheap to compute. Theoretically, we prove that Rod Flow correctly predicts the critical sharpness threshold and explains self-stabilization in quartic potentials.

Though the straight-forward ''best-of-$N$'' (BoN) strategy has already demonstrated significant improvements in performance, it lacks principled guidance on the choice of $N$, budget allocation, and multi-stage decision-making, thereby leaving substantial room for optimization. While many works have explored such optimization, rigorous theoretical guarantees remain limited. In this work, we propose new methodologies to predict and improve scaling properties via tail-guided search. By estimating the tail distribution of rewards, our method predicts the scaling law of LLMs without the need for exhaustive evaluations. Leveraging this prediction tool, we introduce Scaling-Law Guided (SLG) Search, a new test-time algorithm that dynamically allocates compute to identify and exploit intermediate states with the highest predicted potential. We theoretically prove that SLG achieves vanishing regret compared to perfect-information oracles, and achieves expected rewards that would otherwise require a polynomially larger compute budget required when using BoN. Empirically, we validate our framework across different LLMs and reward models, confirming that tail-guided allocation consistently achieves higher reward yields than Best-of-$N$ under identical compute budgets.

However, many machine learning-based models such as neural operators exhibit spectral bias, attenuating high-frequency components that often encode small-scale structure. This limitation is particularly damaging in applications such as weather forecasting, where misrepresented high frequencies can induce long-horizon instability. To address this issue, we propose multi-scale wavelet transformers (MSWTs), which learn system dynamics in a tokenized wavelet domain. The wavelet transform explicitly separates low- and high-frequency content across scales. MSWTs leverage a wavelet-preserving downsampling scheme that retains high-frequency features and employ wavelet-based attention to capture dependencies across scales and frequency bands. Experiments on chaotic dynamical systems show substantial error reductions and improved long horizon spectral fidelity. On the ERA5 climate reanalysis, MSWTs further reduce climatological bias, demonstrating their effectiveness in a real-world forecasting setting.",

Our approach applies STORM (STOchastic Recursive Momentum) to reduce variance in the critic updates. However, because samples are drawn from a nonstationary occupancy measure induced by the evolving policy, variance reduction via STORM alone is insufficient. To address this challenge, we maintain a buffer of small fraction of recent samples and uniformly sample from it for each critic update.

However, overfitting remains a challenge that limits its broader applicability. To improve generalization, we prove that vicinal risk, estimated through noise perturbation or mixup-based data augmentation, is bounded by the sum of empirical risk and a regularization term-either finite difference or the vicinal Jensen gap. Leveraging this decomposition, we propose an evolutionary feature construction framework that jointly optimizes empirical risk and the vicinal Jensen gap to control overfitting. Since datasets may vary in noise levels, we develop a noise estimation strategy to dynamically adjust regularization strength. Furthermore, to mitigate manifold intrusion-where data augmentation may generate unrealistic samples that fall outside the data manifold-we propose a manifold intrusion detection mechanism. Experimental results on 58 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of Jensen gap minimization compared to other complexity measures. Comparisons with 15 machine learning algorithms further indicate that genetic programming with the proposed overfitting control strategy achieves superior performance.",

We show that this instability is not solely due to limited capacity: in the rank-1 regime, optimization is highly sensitive to the update direction. Concretely, pretrained vision and text features form mismatched anisotropic regions, yielding a dominant \"gap\" direction that acts like a translation component and disproportionately steers early gradients under rank-1 constraints. Analyzing pretrained representations, we identify a modality-gap axis that dominates early gradient flow, while a random rank-1 initialization is unlikely to align with it, leading to weak gradients and training collapse. We propose Gap-Init, a geometry-aware initialization that aligns the rank-1 LoRA direction with an estimated modality-gap vector from a small calibration set, while keeping the initial LoRA update zero. Across multiple vision-language tasks and backbones, Gap-Init consistently stabilizes rank-1 training and can match or outperform strong rank-8 baselines. Our results suggest that at the extreme low-rank limit, initial alignment can matter as much as rank itself.",

While empirical techniques, such as positional encoding (PE), sinusoidal activations (SIREN), and batch normalization (BN), effectively mitigate this, their theoretical justifications are predominantly post hoc, focusing on the global NTK spectrum only after modifications are applied. In this work, we reverse this paradigm by introducing a structural diagnostic framework. By performing a layer-wise decomposition of the NTK, we mathematically identify the ``Inlet Rank Collapse'': a phenomenon where the low-dimensional input coordinates fail to span the high-dimensional embedding space, creating a fundamental rank deficiency at the first layer that acts as an expressive bottleneck for the entire network. This framework provides a unified perspective to re-interpret PE, SIREN, and BN as different forms of rank restoration. Guided by this diagnosis, we derive a Rank-Expanding Initialization, a minimalist remedy that ensures the representation rank scales with the layer width without architectural modifications or computational overhead. Our results demonstrate that this principled remedy enables standard MLPs to achieve high-fidelity reconstructions, proving that the key to empowering INRs lies in the structural optimization of the initial rank propagation to effectively populate the latent space.",

        "abstract": "Link prediction is a core challenge in graph machine learning, demanding models that capture rich and complex topological dependencies. While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are the standard solution, state-of-the-art pipelines often rely on explicit structural heuristics or memory-intensive node embeddings -- approaches that struggle to generalize or scale to massive graphs. Emerging Graph Transformers (GTs) offer a potential alternative but often incur significant overhead due to complex structural encodings, hindering their applications to large-scale link prediction. We challenge these sophisticated paradigms with PENCIL, an encoder-only plain Transformer that replaces hand-crafted priors with attention over sampled local subgraphs, retaining the scalability and hardware efficiency of standard Transformers. Through experimental and theoretical analysis, we show that PENCIL extracts richer structural signals than GNNs, implicitly generalizing a broad class of heuristics and subgraph-based expressivity. Empirically, PENCIL outperforms heuristic-informed GNNs and is far more parameter-efficient than ID-embedding--based alternatives, while remaining competitive across diverse benchmarks -- even without node features. Our results challenge the prevailing reliance on complex engineering techniques, demonstrating that simple design choices are potentially sufficient to achieve the same capabilities.",

In this work, we study how implicit bias, defined as subtle statistical prejudice, accumulates and propagates within LLMs equipped with long-term memory. To support systematic analysis, we introduce the Decision-based Implicit Bias (DIB) Benchmark, a large-scale dataset comprising 3,776 decision-making scenarios across nine social domains, designed to quantify implicit bias in long-term decision processes. Using a realistic long-horizon simulation framework, we evaluate six state-of-the-art LLMs integrated with three representative memory architectures on DIB and demonstrate that LLMs' implicit bias does not remain static but intensifies over time and propagates across unrelated domains. We further analyze mitigation strategies and show that a static system-level prompting baseline provides limited and short-lived debiasing effects. To address this limitation, we propose Dynamic Memory Tagging (DMT), an agentic intervention that enforces fairness constraints at memory write time. Extensive experimental results show that DMT substantially reduces bias accumulation and effectively curtails cross-domain bias propagation.",

Although the associated mean-field objective admits a unique mixed Nash equilibrium, the long-time behavior of the original MFL-DA for general nonconvex-nonconcave payoffs has remained largely open. Answering an open question posed by Wang and Chizat (COLT 2024), we provide a partial resolution by proving that this equilibrium is locally exponentially stable: if the initialization is sufficiently close in Wasserstein metric, the dynamics trends to the equilibrium at an exponential rate. The key to our analysis is to establish a coercivity estimate for the entropy near equilibrium via spectral analysis of the linearized operator. We show that this coercivity effectively reveals a local displacement convex-concave structure, thereby driving contraction. This result settles the local stability and quantitative rate questions of Wang and Chizat, leaving global convergence as a remaining open challenge.",

However, instead of explicitly performing temporal interaction through self-attention, linear models implicitly perform it based on stacked MLP structures, which may be insufficient in capturing the complex temporal dependencies and their performance still has potential for improvement. To this end, we propose a Lightweight Sparse Interaction Network (LSINet) for TSF task. Inspired by the sparsity of self-attention, we propose a Multihead Sparse Interaction Mechanism (MSIM). Different from self-attention, MSIM learns the important connections between time steps through sparsity-induced Bernoulli distribution to capture temporal dependencies for TSF. The sparsity is ensured by the proposed self-adaptive regularization loss. Moreover, we observe the shareability of temporal interactions and propose to perform Shared Interaction Learning (SIL) for MSIM to further enhance efficiency and improve convergence. LSINet is a linear model comprising only MLP structures with low overhead and equipped with explicit temporal interaction mechanisms. Extensive experiments on public datasets show that LSINet achieves both higher accuracy and better efficiency than advanced linear models and transformer models in TSF tasks.

We study the simplest possible way to exploit this redundancy: training only a randomly selected subset of parameters at extreme sparsities. Empirically, we find that training just 1\\% of parameters matches or exceeds full-parameter RLVR finetuning across 3 models and 2 task domains. Moreover, different random masks show minimal overlap ($\\leq 0.005$ Jaccard similarity) and yet all succeed, suggesting pretrained models contain many viable sparse subnetworks rather than one privileged set. We term this the Multiple Ticket Hypothesis. We explain this phenomenon through the implicit per-step KL constraint in RLVR, which restricts updates to a low-dimensional subspace, enabling arbitrary sparse masks to succeed.",

We introduce a set of tools for mechanistic interpretability of TSFMs, including ablations of specific components and direct logit attribution on the residual stream. Our findings are consistent across several leading TSFMs with diverse architectures, and across a diverse set of real-world and synthetic time-series datasets. We discover that all models in our study are robust to ablations of entire layers. Furthermore, we develop a theoretical framework framing transformers as kernel regressors, motivating a purely intrinsic strategy for ablating heads based on the stable rank of the per-head projection matrices. Using this approach, we uncover the specific heads responsible for degenerate phenomena widely observed in TSFMs, such as parroting of motifs from the context and seasonality bias.

We propose PIPE, a protocol-level evaluation augmentation for diagnosing interface reliance by minimally rewriting environment interfaces while preserving task semantics and execution behavior. Across 16 environments from AgentBench and AgentGym and a range of open-source and API-based agents, PIPE reveals that trajectory-SFT substantially amplifies interface shortcutting: trained agents degrade sharply under minimal interface rewrites, while non-trajectory-trained models remain largely stable. We further introduce Interface Reliance (IR), a counterbalanced alias-based metric that quantifies preference for training-time interfaces, and show that interface shortcutting exhibits environment-dependent, non-monotonic training dynamics that remain invisible under standard evaluation.

Conventional approaches like soil sampling, process-based models, and black-box machine learning models are facing challenges such as data sparsity, high spatiotemporal heterogeneity, and complex subsurface biogeochemical and physical processes. Developing new trustworthy approaches such as AI-empowered models, will require the AI-ready benchmark dataset and outlined protocols, which unfortunately do not exist. In this work, we introduce a first-of-its-kind spatial-temporal agroecosystem GHG benchmark dataset that integrates physics-based model simulations from Ecosys and DayCent with real-world observations from eddy covariance flux towers and controlled-environment facilities. We evaluate the performance of various sequential deep learning models on carbon and nitrogen flux prediction, including LSTM-based models, temporal CNN-based model, and Transformer-based models. Furthermore, we explored transfer learning to leverage simulated data to improve the generalization of deep learning models on real-world observations.

Most existing approaches assume model congruity (i.e., the use of fully or partially homogeneous models) across users, which limits their applicability in realistic settings. To overcome this limitation, we aim to learn a shared representation space across tasks rather than shared model parameters. To this end, we propose Muscle loss, a novel contrastive learning objective that simultaneously aligns representations from all participating models. Unlike existing multi-view or multi-model contrastive methods, which typically align models pairwise, Muscle loss can effectively capture dependencies across tasks because its minimization is equivalent to the maximization of mutual information among all the models' representations. Building on this principle, we develop FedMuscle, a practical and communication-efficient FMTL algorithm that naturally handles both model and task heterogeneity. Experiments on diverse image and language tasks demonstrate that FedMuscle consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, delivering substantial improvements and robust performance across heterogeneous settings.",

Existing online CP methods maintain target coverage by adaptively scaling the conformal threshold, but typically employ a static nonconformity score function. We show that this fixed geometry leads to highly conservative, volume-inefficient prediction regions when environments undergo structural shifts. To address this, we propose \\textbf{AdaptNC}, a framework for the joint online adaptation of both the nonconformity score parameters and the conformal threshold. AdaptNC leverages an adaptive reweighting scheme to optimize score functions, and introduces a replay buffer mechanism to mitigate the coverage instability that occurs during score transitions. We evaluate AdaptNC on diverse robotic benchmarks involving multi-agent policy changes, environmental changes and sensor degradation. Our results demonstrate that AdaptNC significantly reduces prediction region volume compared to state-of-the-art threshold-only baselines while maintaining target coverage levels.",

To address these limitations, we propose Codebook-based Online-adaptive Multi-scale Embedding for Time-series anomaly detection (COMET), which consists of three key components: (1) Multi-scale Patch Encoding captures temporal dependencies and inter-variable correlations across multiple patch scales. (2) Vector-Quantized Coreset learns representative normal patterns via codebook and detects anomalies with a dual-score combining quantization error and memory distance. (3) Online Codebook Adaptation generates pseudo-labels based on codebook entries and dynamically adapts the model at inference through contrastive learning.

Existing mitigation strategies reduce average error rates but do not provide explicit control over the \\emph{frequency} of such failures under repeated use. We formulate inference as a deployment-time risk control problem and introduce \\emph{chance-constrained inference}, which directly bounds the probability of hallucinations among accepted generations. Hallucinations are modeled as stochastic constraint violations, and we show that confidence-based selective prediction does not, in general, imply probabilistic risk guarantees. To enforce chance constraints efficiently, we propose a sequential, anytime-valid inference procedure that adaptively certifies feasibility or infeasibility using finite samples, avoiding conservative fixed-sample bounds. Experiments on questions inspired by NaturalQuestions and controlled multi-hop question answering demonstrate reliable risk control, early detection of intrinsically infeasible inputs, and safe composition under repeated use, while confidence-based baselines fail to provide consistent guarantees.",

        "abstract": "Molecular structure generation from mass spectrometry is fundamental for understanding cellular metabolism and discovering novel compounds. Although tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) enables the high-throughput acquisition of fragment fingerprints, these spectra often reflect higher-order interactions involving the concerted cleavage of multiple atoms and bonds-crucial for resolving complex isomers and non-local fragmentation mechanisms. However, most existing methods adopt atom-centric and pairwise interaction modeling, overlooking higher-order edge interactions and lacking the capacity to systematically capture essential many-body characteristics for structure generation. To overcome these limitations, we present MBGen, a Many-Body enhanced diffusion framework for de novo molecular structure Generation from mass spectra. By integrating a many-body attention mechanism and higher-order edge modeling, MBGen comprehensively leverages the rich structural information encoded in MS/MS spectra, enabling accurate de novo generation and isomer differentiation for novel molecules. Experimental results on the NPLIB1 and MassSpecGym benchmarks demonstrate that MBGen achieves superior performance, with improvements of up to 230% over state-of-the-art methods, highlighting the scientific value and practical utility of many-body modeling for mass spectrometry-based molecular generation. Further analysis and ablation studies show that our approach effectively captures higher-order interactions and exhibits enhanced sensitivity to complex isomeric and non-local fragmentation information.",

We argue that this failure is not an engineering problem but a violation of physical postulates. Drawing inspiration from physics, we identify three constraints that any generalizing system must satisfy: (1) Locality -- information propagates at finite speed; (2) Symmetry -- the laws of computation are invariant across space and time; (3) Stability -- the system converges to discrete attractors that resist noise accumulation. From these postulates, we derive -- rather than design -- the Spatiotemporal Evolution with Attractor Dynamics (SEAD) architecture: a neural cellular automaton where local convolutional rules are iterated until convergence. Experiments on three tasks validate our theory: (1) Parity -- demonstrating perfect length generalization via light-cone propagation; (2) Addition -- achieving scale-invariant inference from L=16 to L=1 million with 100% accuracy, exhibiting input-adaptive computation; (3) Rule 110 -- learning a Turing-complete cellular automaton without trajectory divergence. Our results suggest that the gap between statistical learning and logical reasoning can be bridged -- not by scaling parameters, but by respecting the physics of computation.",

To expose the implicit model multiplicity underlying CP, we build on recent results showing that, under a mild assumption, any full CP procedure induces a set of closed and convex predictive distributions, commonly referred to as a credal set. Importantly, the conformal prediction region (CPR) coincides exactly with the set of labels to which all distributions in the induced credal set assign probability at least $1-\\alpha$. As our first contribution, we prove that this characterisation also holds in split CP. Building on this connection, we then propose a computationally efficient and analytically tractable uncertainty measure, based on \\emph{Maximum Mean Imprecision}, to quantify the EPU by measuring the degree of conflicting information within the induced credal set. Experiments on active learning and selective classification demonstrate that the quantified EPU provides substantially more informative and fine-grained uncertainty assessments than reliance on CPR size alone. More broadly, this work highlights the potential of CP serving as a principled basis for decision-making under epistemic uncertainty.",

The learner aims to recommend actions that perform well under the agent's true objective, and the performance is measured by the regret, defined as the cumulative gap between the agent's optimal values and those achieved by the learner's recommended actions. Prior work has established a regret bound of $O(d\\log T)$, as well as a finite but exponentially large bound of $\\exp(O(d\\log d))$, where $d$ is the dimension of the optimization problem and $T$ is the time horizon, while a regret lower bound of $\\Omega(d)$ is known (Gollapudi et al. 2021; Sakaue et al. 2025). Whether a finite regret bound polynomial in $d$ is achievable or not has remained an open question. We partially resolve this by showing that when the feasible sets are M-convex -- a broad class that includes matroids -- a finite regret bound of $O(d\\log d)$ is possible. We achieve this by combining a structural characterization of optimal solutions on M-convex sets with a geometric volume argument. Moreover, we extend our approach to adversarially corrupted feedback in up to $C$ rounds. We obtain a regret bound of $O((C+1)d\\log d)$ without prior knowledge of $C$, by monitoring directed graphs induced by the observed feedback to detect corruptions adaptively.",

Machine unlearning is pivotal for mitigating these risks, yet existing paradigms face a fundamental dilemma: aggressive unlearning often induces catastrophic forgetting that degrades model utility, whereas conservative strategies risk superficial forgetting, leaving models vulnerable to adversarial recovery. To address this trade-off, we propose $\\textbf{AGT$^{AO}$}$ (Adversarial Gating Training with Adaptive Orthogonality), a unified framework designed to reconcile robust erasure with utility preservation. Specifically, our approach introduces $\\textbf{Adaptive Orthogonality (AO)}$ to dynamically mitigate geometric gradient conflicts between forgetting and retention objectives, thereby minimizing unintended knowledge degradation. Concurrently, $\\textbf{Adversarial Gating Training (AGT)}$ formulates unlearning as a latent-space min-max game, employing a curriculum-based gating mechanism to simulate and counter internal recovery attempts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that $\\textbf{AGT$^{AO}$}$ achieves a superior trade-off between unlearning efficacy (KUR $\\approx$ 0.01) and model utility (MMLU 58.30).

We train small-to-medium models over 10,000 hyperparameter configurations and evaluate more than 40 measures computable from the trained model and the available training data alone. We significantly broaden the experimental scope along multiple axes: (i) extending the evaluation beyond the standard IID setting to include benchmarking for robustness across diverse distribution shifts, (ii) evaluating multiple architectures and training recipes, and (iii) newly incorporating calibration- and information-criteria-based measures to assess their alignment with both IID and OOD generalization.

Moreover, neural networks architectures for general domain time series forecasting are becoming more and more complicated and their performance has almost saturated in recent years.

To overcome this, we introduce the Collaborative Memory Transformer (CoMeT), a novel architecture that enables LLMs to handle arbitrarily long sequences with constant memory usage and linear time complexity. Designed as an efficient, plug-in module, CoMeT can be integrated into pre-trained models with only minimal fine-tuning. It operates on sequential data chunks, using a dual-memory system to manage context: a temporary memory on a FIFO queue for recent events, and a global memory with a gated update rule for long-range dependencies. These memories then act as a dynamic soft prompt for the next chunk. To enable efficient fine-tuning on extremely long contexts, we introduce a novel layer-level pipeline parallelism strategy. The effectiveness of our approach is remarkable: a model equipped with CoMeT and fine-tuned on 32k contexts can accurately retrieve a passkey from any position within a 1M token sequence. On the SCROLLS benchmark, CoMeT surpasses other efficient methods and achieves performance comparable to a full-attention baseline on summarization tasks. Its practical effectiveness is further validated on real-world agent and user behavior QA tasks. The code is available at: this https URL",

Here, we present DIA-CLIP, a pre-trained model shifting the DIA analysis paradigm from semi-supervised training to universal cross-modal representation learning. By integrating dual-encoder contrastive learning framework with encoder-decoder architecture, DIA-CLIP establishes a unified cross-modal representation for peptides and corresponding spectral features, achieving high-precision, zero-shot PSM inference. Extensive evaluations across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that DIA-CLIP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art tools, yielding up to a 45% increase in protein identification while achieving a 12% reduction in entrapment identifications. Moreover, DIA-CLIP holds immense potential for diverse practical applications, such as single-cell and spatial proteomics, where its enhanced identification depth facilitates the discovery of novel biomarkers and the elucidates of intricate cellular mechanisms.",

        "abstract": "Time series forecasting has traditionally been formulated as a model-centric, static, and single-pass prediction problem that maps historical observations to future values. While this paradigm has driven substantial progress, it proves insufficient in adaptive and multi-turn settings where forecasting requires informative feature extraction, reasoning-driven inference, iterative refinement, and continual adaptation over time. In this paper, we argue for agentic time series forecasting (ATSF), which reframes forecasting as an agentic process composed of perception, planning, action, reflection, and memory. Rather than focusing solely on predictive models, ATSF emphasizes organizing forecasting as an agentic workflow that can interact with tools, incorporate feedback from outcomes, and evolve through experience accumulation. We outline three representative implementation paradigms -- workflow-based design, agentic reinforcement learning, and a hybrid agentic workflow paradigm -- and discuss the opportunities and challenges that arise when shifting from model-centric prediction to agentic forecasting. Together, this position aims to establish agentic forecasting as a foundation for future research at the intersection of time series forecasting.",

Recent efforts have sought to extend this paradigm to open-ended tasks by employing LLMs-as-a-Judge to provide sequence-level rewards for policy optimization. However, these rewards are inherently sparse, failing to provide the fine-grained supervision necessary for generating complex, long-form trajectories. Furthermore, current work treats the Judge as a black-box oracle, discarding the rich intermediate feedback signals encoded in it. To address these limitations, we introduce Grad2Reward, a novel framework that extracts dense process rewards directly from the Judge's model inference process via a single backward pass. By leveraging gradient-based attribution, Grad2Reward enables precise token-level credit assignment, substantially enhancing training efficiency and reasoning quality. Additionally, Grad2Reward introduces a self-judging mechanism, allowing the policy to improve through its own evaluative signals without training specialized reward models or reliance on superior external Judges. The experiments demonstrate that policies optimized with Grad2Reward achieve outstanding performance across diverse open-ended tasks, affirming its effectiveness and broad generalizability.",

While recent studies attribute this to \"training inference mismatch stemming\" from inconsistent hybrid engines, standard remedies, such as Importance Sampling, might fail during extended training runs. In this work, we analyze this instability through the lens of optimization, demonstrating that gradient noise and training-inference mismatch escalate in tandem as training progresses. Meanwhile, we find that the mismatch can be effectively suppressed by shrinking the update size. Taken together, we deduce that the mismatch is not merely a static numerical discrepancy, but a dynamic failure coupled with the model's optimization. Based on this insight, we propose a simple yet effective solution: a specialized Learning Rate (LR) scheduler. Instead of pre-defined decay schedule in traditional LR scheduler, our method dynamically triggers LR decay based on response length, which we identify as a reliable early-warning signal for impending instability. Empirical evidence suggests that by reducing the learning rate as gradient noise rises, we can consistently stabilize RL training and keep the training-inference mismatch at a safe level.",

In this work, we question this paradigm by proposing an additional condition of geometry-task alignment, i.e., whether the metric structure of the target follows that of the input graph. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate the capability of HGNNs to recover low-distortion representations on two synthetic regression problems, and show that their geometric inductive bias becomes helpful when the problem requires preserving metric structure. Additionally, we evaluate HGNNs on the tasks of link prediction and node classification by jointly analyzing predictive performance and embedding distortion, revealing that only link prediction is geometry-aligned. Overall, our findings shift the focus from only asking \"Is the graph hyperbolic?\" to also questioning \"Is the task aligned with hyperbolic geometry?\", showing that HGNNs consistently outperform Euclidean models under such alignment, while their advantage vanishes otherwise.",

As a result, developing effective and efficient TTS methods to unlock dLLMs' full generative potential remains an underexplored challenge. To address this, we propose Prism (Pruning, Remasking, and Integrated Self-verification Method), an efficient TTS framework for dLLMs that (i) performs Hierarchical Trajectory Search (HTS) which dynamically prunes and reallocates compute in an early-to-mid denoising window, (ii) introduces Local branching with partial remasking to explore diverse implementations while preserving high-confidence tokens, and (iii) replaces external verifiers with Self-Verified Feedback (SVF) obtained via self-evaluation prompts on intermediate completions. Across four mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks on three dLLMs, including LLaDA 8B Instruct, Dream 7B Instruct, and LLaDA 2.0-mini, our Prism achieves a favorable performance-efficiency trade-off, matching best-of-N performance with substantially fewer function evaluations (NFE).

These powerful representations position Proust in a sweet spot as it also retains native generative capabilities that MLMs lack by design. Interpretability analysis reveals that per-position entropy variance predicts, to an extent, when retrieval augmentation helps and hurts.

Our algorithm stems from the observation that most existing MDLMs rely on a confidence-based sampling strategy, where only tokens with the highest prediction confidence are preserved at each step. This restricts the generation to a noise-sensitive, greedy decoding paradigm, resulting in an inevitable collapse in the diversity of possible paths. We address this problem by launching multiple interacting diffusion processes in parallel, referred to as particles, for trajectory exploration. Importantly, we introduce the trajectory-level confidence as a self-rewarding signal for assigning particle importance weights. During sampling, particles are iteratively weighted and resampled to systematically steer generation towards globally confident, high-quality samples. Our self-rewarding SMC is verified on various masked diffusion language models and benchmarks, achieving significant improvement without extra training or reward guidance, while effectively converting parallel inference capacity into improved sampling quality.

However, three key challenges remain: (1) existing unlearning objectives often compromise model utility or increase vulnerability to Membership Inference Attacks (MIA); (2) there is a persistent conflict between forgetting and utility, where further unlearning inevitably harms retained performance; and (3) support for concurrent multi-client unlearning is poor, as gradient conflicts among clients degrade the quality of forgetting. To address these issues, we propose FUPareto, an efficient unlearning framework via Pareto-augmented optimization. We first introduce the Minimum Boundary Shift (MBS) Loss, which enforces unlearning by suppressing the target class logit below the highest non-target class logit; this can improve the unlearning efficiency and mitigate MIA risks. During the unlearning process, FUPareto performs Pareto improvement steps to preserve model utility and executes Pareto expansion to guarantee forgetting. Specifically, during Pareto expansion, the framework integrates a Null-Space Projected Multiple Gradient Descent Algorithm (MGDA) to decouple gradient conflicts. This enables effective, fair, and concurrent unlearning for multiple clients while minimizing utility degradation. Extensive experiments across diverse scenarios demonstrate that FUPareto consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FU methods in both unlearning efficacy and retained utility.",

Existing designs suffer from two limitations: (i) they do not fully leverage the entire history for treatment allocation; (ii) they rely on strong assumptions to approximate the objective function (e.g., the mean squared error of the estimated treatment effect) for optimizing the design. We first establish an impossibility theorem showing that failure to condition on the full history leads to suboptimal designs, due to the dynamic dependencies in time series experiments. To address both limitations simultaneously, we next propose a transformer reinforcement learning (RL) approach which leverages transformers to condition allocation on the entire history and employs RL to directly optimize the MSE without relying on restrictive assumptions.

This paper presents a novel, data-efficient deep learning framework designed to achieve precise and accurate control using minimal sensor hardware. Leveraging an external dataset of 8 subjects, our approach implements a hybrid Transformer optimized for sparse, two-channel surface electromyography (sEMG). Unlike standard architectures that use fixed positional encodings, we integrate Time2Vec learnable temporal embeddings to capture the stochastic temporal warping inherent in biological signals. Furthermore, we employ a normalized additive fusion strategy that aligns the latent distributions of spatial and temporal features, preventing the destructive interference common in standard implementations. A two-stage curriculum learning protocol is utilized to ensure robust feature extraction despite data scarcity. The proposed architecture achieves a state-of-the-art multi-subject F1-score of 95.7% $\\pm$ 0.20% for a 10-class movement set, statistically outperforming both a standard Transformer with fixed encodings and a recurrent CNN-LSTM model. Architectural optimization reveals that a balanced allocation of model capacity between spatial and temporal dimensions yields the highest stability. Furthermore, while direct transfer to a new unseen subject led to poor accuracy due to domain shifts, a rapid calibration protocol utilizing only two trials per gesture recovered performance from 21.0% $\\pm$ 2.98% to 96.9% $\\pm$ 0.52%. By validating that high-fidelity temporal embeddings can compensate for low spatial resolution, this work challenges the necessity of high-density sensing.

We introduce \\emph{internal flow signatures} that audit decision formation from depthwise dynamics at a fixed inter-block monitoring boundary. The method stabilizes token-wise motion via bias-centered monitoring, then summarizes trajectories in compact \\emph{moving} readout-aligned subspaces constructed from the top token and its close competitors within each depth window. Neighboring window frames are aligned by an orthogonal transport, yielding depth-comparable transported step lengths, turning angles, and subspace drift summaries that are invariant to within-window basis choices. A lightweight GRU validator trained on these signatures performs self-checking without modifying the base model. Beyond detection, the validator localizes a culprit depth event and enables a targeted refinement: the model rolls back to the culprit token and clamps an abnormal transported step at the identified block while preserving the orthogonal residual. The resulting pipeline provides actionable localization and low-overhead self-checking from internal decision dynamics. \\emph{Code is available at} \\texttt{this http URL}.",

        "abstract": "Bayesian active learning relies on the precise quantification of predictive uncertainty to explore unknown function landscapes. While Gaussian process surrogates are the standard for such tasks, an underappreciated fact is that their posterior variance depends on the observed outputs only through the hyperparameters, rendering exploration largely insensitive to the actual measurements. We propose to inject observation-dependent feedback by warping the input space with a learned, monotone reparameterization. This mechanism allows the design policy to expand or compress regions of the input space in response to observed variability, thereby shaping the behavior of variance-based acquisition functions. We demonstrate that while such warps can be trained via marginal likelihood, a novel self-supervised objective yields substantially better performance. Our approach improves sample efficiency across a range of active learning benchmarks, particularly in regimes where non-stationarity challenges traditional methods.",

To adapt to these measures, we develop algorithms based on global optimization and policy optimization, both built on optimistic follow-the-regularized-leader with log-barrier regularization. For global optimization, our algorithms achieve first-order, second-order, and path-length regret bounds in the adversarial regime, and in the stochastic regime, they achieve a variance-aware gap-independent bound and a variance-aware gap-dependent bound that is polylogarithmic in the number of episodes. For policy optimization, our algorithms achieve the same data- and variance-dependent adaptivity, up to a factor of the episode horizon, by exploiting a new optimistic $Q$-function estimator. Finally, we establish regret lower bounds in terms of data-dependent complexity measures for the adversarial regime and a variance measure for the stochastic regime, implying that the regret upper bounds achieved by the global-optimization approach are nearly optimal.",

However, as modern LLMs increasingly rely on extended reasoning chains, existing schemes face two critical challenges: (1) efficiency bottleneck, where attributing a target span of M tokens within a context of length N requires O(M*N) operations, making long-context attribution prohibitively slow; and (2) faithfulness drop, where intermediate reasoning tokens absorb attribution mass, preventing importance from propagating back to the original input. To address these, we introduce FlashTrace, an efficient multi-token attribution method that employs span-wise aggregation to compute attribution over multi-token targets in a single pass, while maintaining faithfulness. Moreover, we design a recursive attribution mechanism that traces importance through intermediate reasoning chains back to source inputs. Extensive experiments on long-context retrieval (RULER) and multi-step reasoning (MATH, MorehopQA) tasks demonstrate that FlashTrace achieves over 130x speedup over existing baselines while maintaining superior faithfulness. We further analyze the dynamics of recursive attribution, showing that even a single recursive hop improves faithfulness by tracing importance through the reasoning chain.",

        "abstract": "Over the past years, embedding learning on networks has shown tremendous results in link prediction tasks for complex systems, with a wide range of real-life applications. Learning a representation for each node in a knowledge graph allows us to capture topological and semantic information, which can be processed in downstream analyses later. In the link prediction task, high-dimensional network information is encoded into low-dimensional vectors, which are then fed to a predictor to infer new connections between nodes in the network. As the network complexity (that is, the numbers of connections and types of interactions) grows, embedding learning turns out increasingly challenging. This review covers published models on embedding learning on multiplex networks for link prediction. First, we propose refined taxonomies to classify and compare models, depending on the type of embeddings and embedding techniques. Second, we review and address the problem of reproducible and fair evaluation of embedding learning on multiplex networks for the link prediction task. Finally, we tackle evaluation on directed multiplex networks by proposing a novel and fair testing procedure. This review constitutes a crucial step towards the development of more performant and tractable embedding learning approaches for multiplex networks and their fair evaluation for the link prediction task. We also suggest guidelines on the evaluation of models, and provide an informed perspective on the challenges and tools currently available to address downstream analyses applied to multiplex networks.",

BIONIC uses pretrained embeddings for complex modalities such as medical images and clinical text, while incorporating structured clinical variables directly within a Bayesian multimodal formulation. The proposed framework enables robust learning in partially observed and semi-supervised settings by explicitly modeling modality-level and variable-level missingness, as well as missing labels. We evaluate BIONIC on three multimodal clinical and biomedical datasets, demonstrating strong and consistent discriminative performance compared to representative multimodal baselines, particularly under incomplete data scenarios.

The complex spatio-temporal dependencies and nonlinear dynamics of urban mobility networks further complicate few-shot learning across different cities. This paper proposes MCPST, a novel Multi-phase Consensus Spatio-Temporal framework for few-shot traffic forecasting that reconceptualises traffic prediction as a multi-phase consensus learning problem. Our framework introduces three core innovations: (1) a multi-phase engine that models traffic dynamics through diffusion, synchronisation, and spectral embeddings for comprehensive dynamic characterisation; (2) an adaptive consensus mechanism that dynamically fuses phase-specific predictions while enforcing consistency; and (3) a structured meta-learning strategy for rapid adaptation to new cities with minimal data. We establish extensive theoretical guarantees, including representation theorems with bounded approximation errors and generalisation bounds for few-shot adaptation. Through experiments on four real-world datasets, MCPST outperforms fourteen state-of-the-art methods in spatio-temporal graph learning methods, dynamic graph transfer learning methods, prompt-based spatio-temporal prediction methods and cross-domain few-shot settings, improving prediction accuracy while reducing required training data and providing interpretable insights.

However, optimizing for perceptual metrics such as the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) causes limited design diversity. To address this, we propose the Diversity Score (DS), a metric that quantifies layout diversity under fixed constraints. Moreover, to improve geometric consistency, we introduce a Boundary Cross-Attention (BCA) module that enables conditioning on building boundaries. Our experiments show that BCA significantly improves boundary adherence, while prolonged training drives diversity collapse undiagnosed by FID, revealing a critical trade-off between realism and diversity. Out-Of-Distribution evaluations further demonstrate the models' reliance on dataset priors, emphasizing the need for generative systems that explicitly balance fidelity, diversity, and generalization in architectural design tasks.",

This has the disadvantage of limiting the applicability of the resulting model for other downstream tasks. Here, instead, we propose to represent the joint probability distribution by means of conditional probability distributions for each group of variables conditioned on the rest. Such models can then be used for practically any possible downstream task. Their learning can be approached as training a parametrised Markov chain kernel by maximising the data likelihood of its limiting distribution.

Existing attempts to bridge this gap primarily rely on retrieving successful past trajectories as demonstrations. However, this paradigm faces two critical limitations. First, by focusing solely on success, agents overlook the rich pedagogical value embedded in failed attempts, preventing them from identifying and avoiding recurrent pitfalls. Second, continually accumulating textual experiences not only increases the time consumption during retrieval but also inevitably introduces noise and exhausts the largest context window of current LLMs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel self-evolving framework for LLM agents that introduces a complementary evolution mechanism: First, a contrastive reflection strategy is introduced to explicitly summarize error-prone patterns and capture reusable insights. Second, we propose a self-consolidation mechanism that distills non-parametric textual experience into compact learnable parameters. This enables the agent to internalize extensive historical experience directly into its latent space. Extensive experiments demonstrate the advantages of our method in long-term agent evolution.",

Structured pruning offers acceleration benefits but leads to significant performance degradation. Recent PCA-based pruning methods have alleviated this issue by retaining key activation components, but are only applied between modules in order to fuse the transformation matrix, which introduces extra parameters and severely disrupts activation distributions due to residual connections. To address these issues, we propose IntraSlice, a framework that applies block-wise module-intra PCA compression pruning. By leveraging the structural characteristics of Transformer modules, we design an approximate PCA method whose transformation matrices can be fully fused into the model without additional parameters. We also introduce a PCA-based global pruning ratio estimator that further considers the distribution of compressed activations, building on conventional module importance. We validate our method on Llama2, Llama3, and Phi series across various language benchmarks.

Recent methods leverage sparse expert routing to promote task specialization, but we find that the expert routing process suffers from drift as the data distribution evolves. For example, a grounding query that previously activated localization experts may instead be routed to irrelevant experts after learning OCR tasks. Meanwhile, the grounding-related experts can be overwritten by new tasks and lose their original functionality. Such failure reflects two problems: router drift, where expert selection becomes inconsistent over time, and expert drift, where shared experts are overwritten across tasks. Therefore, we propose StAbilized Mixture-of-Experts (SAME) for MCIT. To address router drift, SAME stabilizes expert selection by decomposing routing dynamics into orthogonal subspaces and updating only task-relevant directions. To mitigate expert drift, we regulate expert updates via curvature-aware scaling using historical input covariance in a rehearsal-free manner. SAME also introduces adaptive expert activation to freeze selected experts during training, reducing redundant computation and cross-task interference. Extensive experiments demonstrate its SOTA performance.",

        "abstract": "Recent works have shown that layer pruning can compress large language models (LLMs) while retaining strong performance on classification benchmarks with little or no finetuning. However, existing pruning techniques often suffer severe degradation on generative reasoning tasks. Through a systematic study across multiple model families, we find that tasks requiring multi-step reasoning are particularly sensitive to depth reduction. Beyond surface-level text degeneration, we observe degradation of critical algorithmic capabilities, including arithmetic computation for mathematical reasoning and balanced parenthesis generation for code synthesis. Under realistic post-training constraints, without access to pretraining-scale data or compute, we evaluate a simple mitigation strategy based on supervised finetuning with Self-Generated Responses. This approach achieves strong recovery on classification tasks, retaining up to 90\\% of baseline performance, and yields substantial gains of up to 20--30 percentage points on generative benchmarks compared to prior post-pruning techniques. Crucially, despite these gains, recovery for generative reasoning remains fundamentally limited relative to classification tasks and is viable primarily at lower pruning ratios. Overall, we characterize the practical limits of layer pruning for generative reasoning and provide guidance on when depth reduction can be applied effectively under constrained post-training regimes.",

We propose Logic-Guided Vector Fields (LGVF), a neuro-symbolic framework that injects symbolic knowledge, specified as differentiable relaxations of logical constraints, into flow matching generative models. LGVF couples two complementary mechanisms: (1) a training-time logic loss that penalizes constraint violations along continuous flow trajectories, with weights that emphasize correctness near the target distribution; and (2) an inference-time adjustment that steers sampling using constraint gradients, acting as a lightweight, logic-informed correction to the learned dynamics. We evaluate LGVF on three constrained generation case studies spanning linear, nonlinear, and multi-region feasibility constraints. Across all settings, LGVF reduces constraint violations by 59-82% compared to standard flow matching and achieves the lowest violation rates in each case. In the linear and ring settings, LGVF also improves distributional fidelity as measured by MMD, while in the multi-obstacle setting, we observe a satisfaction-fidelity trade-off, with improved feasibility but increased MMD. Beyond quantitative gains, LGVF yields constraint-aware vector fields exhibiting emergent obstacle-avoidance behavior, routing samples around forbidden regions without explicit path planning.",

Most existing DG approaches focus on learning domain-invariant representations under the assumption of conditional distribution shift (i.e., primarily addressing changes in $P(X\\mid Y)$ while assuming $P(Y)$ remains stable). However, real-world scenarios with multiple domains often involve compound distribution shifts where both the marginal label distribution $P(Y)$ and the conditional distribution $P(X\\mid Y)$ vary simultaneously. To address this, we propose a unified framework for robust domain generalization under divergent marginal and conditional distributions. We derive a novel risk bound for unseen domains by explicitly decomposing the joint distribution into marginal and conditional components and characterizing risk gaps arising from both sources of divergence. To operationalize this bound, we design a meta-learning procedure that minimizes and validates the proposed risk bound across seen domains, ensuring strong generalization to unseen ones. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance not only on conventional DG benchmarks but also in challenging multi-domain long-tailed recognition settings where both marginal and conditional shifts are pronounced.",

While NVFP4 mitigates quantization error via hierarchical microscaling, a persistent loss gap remains compared to BF16. This study conducts a longitudinal analysis of outlier dynamics across architecture during NVFP4 pretraining, focusing on where they localize, why they occur, and how they evolve temporally. We find that, compared with Softmax Attention (SA), Linear Attention (LA) reduces per-tensor heavy tails but still exhibits persistent block-level spikes under block quantization. Our analysis attributes outliers to specific architectural components: Softmax in SA, gating in LA, and SwiGLU in FFN, with \"post-QK\" operations exhibiting higher sensitivity to quantization. Notably, outliers evolve from transient spikes early in training to a small set of persistent hot channels (i.e., channels with persistently large magnitudes) in later stages. Based on these findings, we introduce Hot-Channel Patch (HCP), an online compensation mechanism that identifies hot channels and reinjects residuals using hardware-efficient kernels. We then develop CHON, an NVFP4 training recipe integrating HCP with post-QK operation protection. On GLA-1.3B model trained for 60B tokens, CHON reduces the loss gap to BF16 from 0.94% to 0.58% while maintaining downstream accuracy.",

Offline RL tends to get stuck in local optima, and in FRL, one device's suboptimal policy can degrade the aggregated model, i.e., policy pollution. We present FORLER, combining Q-ensemble aggregation on the server with actor rectification on devices. The server robustly merges device Q-functions to curb policy pollution and shift heavy computation off resource-constrained hardware without compromising privacy. Locally, actor rectification enriches policy gradients via a zeroth-order search for high-Q actions plus a bespoke regularizer that nudges the policy toward them. A $\\delta$-periodic strategy further reduces local computation. We theoretically provide safe policy improvement performance guarantees.

Several online algorithms are being deployed, but they overlook the following two key challenges inherent to conversational LLM services: (1) unsatisfied users may retry queries, increasing the server backlog, and (2) requests for ``explicit\" feedback, such as ratings, degrade user experiences. In this paper, we develop a joint routing and scheduling algorithm that leverages ``implicit\" feedback inferred from user retrial behaviors. The key idea is to propose and study the framework of contextual queueing bandits with multinomial logit feedback (CQB-MNL). CQB-MNL models query retrials, as well as context-based learning for user preferences over LLMs. Our algorithm, anytime CQB (ACQB), achieves efficient learning while maintaining queue stability by combining Thompson sampling with forced exploration at a decaying rate. We show that ACQB simultaneously achieves a cumulative regret of $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{t})$ for routing and a queue length regret of $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(t^{-1/4})$ for any large $t$. For experiments, we refine query embeddings via contrastive learning while adopting a disjoint parameter model to learn LLM-specific parameters.

This bottleneck stems from two hardware limitations: (1) limited data bandwidth between matrix and vector compute cores, and (2) the significant area cost of high-precision (FP32/16) exponentiation units (EXP2). To address these issues, we introduce a novel low-precision workflow that employs a specific 8-bit floating-point format (HiF8) and block-aware precision rescaling for softmax. Crucially, our algorithmic innovations make low-precision softmax feasible without the significant model accuracy loss that hampers direct low-precision approaches. Specifically, our design (i) halves the required data movement bandwidth by enabling matrix multiplication outputs constrained to 8-bit, and (ii) substantially reduces the EXP2 unit area by computing exponentiations in low (8-bit) precision. Extensive evaluation on language models and multi-modal models confirms the validity of our method. By alleviating the vector computation bottleneck, our work paves the way for doubling end-to-end inference throughput without increasing chip area, and offers a concrete co-design path for future low-precision hardware and software.",

This article presents a Python implementation of ASM, featuring end-to-end calibration using real-world ground truth data. The calibration is formulated as a parameterized kernel optimization problem. The model is calibrated using data from a full-state observation testbed, with input from a sparse radar sensor network. The implementation is developed in PyTorch, enabling integration with various deep learning methods. We evaluate the results in terms of speed distribution, spatio-temporal error distribution, and spatial error to provide benchmark metrics for the traffic reconstruction problem. We further demonstrate the usability of the calibrated method across multiple freeways. Finally, we discuss the challenges of reproducibility in general traffic model calibration and the limitations of ASM.

While Mansouri et al. assume an idealized setting, where the contrastive example is at minimum distance of the originally queried/sampled point, we introduce and analyze a mechanism, parameterized by a non-decreasing noise function $f$, under which this ideal contrastive example is perturbed. The amount of perturbation is controlled by $f(d)$, where $d$ is the distance of the queried/sampled point to the decision boundary. Intuitively, this results in higher-quality contrastive examples for points closer to the decision boundary. We study this model in two settings: (i) when the maximum perturbation magnitude is fixed, and (ii) when it is stochastic. For one-dimensional thresholds and for half-spaces under the uniform distribution on a bounded domain, we characterize active and passive contrastive sample complexity in dependence on the function $f$. We show that, under certain conditions on $f$, the presence of contrastive examples speeds up learning in terms of asymptotic query complexity and asymptotic expected query complexity.",

In this setting, designing efficient no-swap regret translates to sublinear -- in horizon $T$ -- swap regret with polylogarithmic dependence on $N$. In contrast to the weaker notion of external regret minimization - a problem which is fairly well understood in the literature - achieving no-swap regret with a polylogarithmic dependence on $N$ has remained elusive in combinatorial bandits. Our paper resolves this challenge, by introducing a no-swap-regret learning algorithm with regret that scales polylogarithmically in $N$ and is tight for the class of combinatorial bandits. To ground our results, we also demonstrate how to implement the proposed algorithm efficiently -- that is, with a per-iteration complexity that also scales polylogarithmically in $N$ -- across a wide range of well-studied applications.",

To deepen the understanding between LLM's internal states and its verbalized reasoning trajectories, we investigate the latent planning strength of LLMs, through our probing method, Tele-Lens, applying to hidden states across diverse task domains. Our empirical results indicate that LLMs exhibit a myopic horizon, primarily conducting incremental transitions without precise global planning. Leveraging this characteristic, we propose a hypothesis on enhancing uncertainty estimation of CoT, which we validate that a small subset of CoT positions can effectively represent the uncertainty of the entire path. We further underscore the significance of exploiting CoT dynamics, and demonstrate that automatic recognition of CoT bypass can be achieved without performance degradation.

Motivated by this, we propose order-expressive masked diffusion model (OeMDM) for a broad class of diffusion generative processes with various generation orders, enabling the interpretation of MDM, ARM, and block diffusion in a single framework. Furthermore, building on OeMDM, we introduce learnable-order masked diffusion model (LoMDM), which jointly learns the generation ordering and diffusion backbone through a single objective from scratch, enabling the diffusion model to generate text in context-dependent ordering. Empirically, we confirm that LoMDM outperforms various discrete diffusion models across multiple language modeling benchmarks.",

While maximizing VNE under constraints is well known in quantum settings, a principled analogue of the classical maximum entropy framework, particularly its decision theoretic and game theoretic interpretation, has not been explicitly developed for VNE in data driven contexts. In this paper, we extend the minimax formulation of the maximum entropy principle due to Grünwald and Dawid to the setting of von Neumann entropy, providing a game-theoretic justification for VNE maximization over density matrices and trace-normalized positive semidefinite operators. This perspective yields a robust interpretation of maximum VNE solutions under partial information and clarifies their role as least committed inferences in spectral domains. We then illustrate how the resulting Maximum VNE principle applies to modern machine learning problems by considering two representative applications, selecting a kernel representation from multiple normalized embeddings via kernel-based VNE maximization, and completing kernel matrices from partially observed entries. These examples demonstrate how the proposed framework offers a unifying information-theoretic foundation for VNE-based methods in kernel learning.",

Among existing methods, GPTQ has been widely adopted due to its efficiency; however, it neglects input statistics and inter-group correlations when determining group scales, leading to a mismatch with its goal of minimizing layer-wise reconstruction loss. In this work, we propose a two-stage optimization framework for group scales that explicitly minimizes the layer-wise reconstruction loss. In the first stage, performed prior to GPTQ, we initialize each group scale to minimize the group-wise reconstruction loss, thereby incorporating input statistics. In the second stage, we freeze the integer weights obtained via GPTQ and refine the group scales to minimize the layer-wise reconstruction loss. To this end, we employ the coordinate descent algorithm and derive a closed-form update rule, which enables efficient refinement without costly numerical optimization. Notably, our derivation incorporates the quantization errors from preceding layers to prevent error accumulation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently enhances group-wise quantization, achieving higher accuracy with negligible overhead.",

However, manually designing piecewise deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents cannot keep pace with frequent dynamics shifts and service-level agreement (SLA) changes of an evolving DC. This specification-to-policy lag causes a lack of timely, effective control policies, which may lead to service outages. To bridge the gap, we present DCoPilot, a hybrid framework for generative control policies in dynamic DC operation. DCoPilot synergizes two distinct generative paradigms, i.e., a large language model (LLM) that performs symbolic generation of structured reward forms, and a hypernetwork that conducts parametric generation of policy weights. DCoPilot operates through three coordinated phases: (i) simulation scale-up, which stress-tests reward candidates across diverse simulation-ready (SimReady) scenes; (ii) meta policy distillation, where a hypernetwork is trained to output policy weights conditioned on SLA and scene embeddings; and (iii) online adaptation, enabling zero-shot policy generation in response to updated specifications. Evaluated across five control task families spanning diverse DC components, DCoPilot achieves near-zero constraint violations and outperforms all baselines across specification variations. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of LLM-based unified reward generation in enabling stable hypernetwork convergence.",

Across math (AIME24, AIME25, HMMT25) and code (LiveCodeBench) reasoning benchmarks, our models consistently outperform prompting and majority-voting baselines, often approaching or exceeding much larger models. Moreover, these gains generalize to selecting outputs from stronger models despite training only on outputs from weaker models.

To reduce overhead and improve exploration, prior work introduces tree structured rollouts, which share reasoning prefixes and branch at key nodes to improve sampling efficiency. However, this paradigm still faces two challenges: (1) high entropy branching can trigger rollout collapse, where the branching budget concentrates on a few trajectories with consecutive high-entropy segments, rapidly reducing the number of effective branches; (2) early pseudo-labels are noisy and biased, which can induce self-reinforcing overfitting, causing the policy to sharpen prematurely and suppress exploration. To address these issues, we propose Entropy Confidence Hybrid Group Relative Policy Optimization (ECHO). During rollout, ECHO jointly leverages local entropy and group level confidence to adaptively control branch width, and further introduces online confidence-based pruning to terminate persistently low confidence branches, avoiding high entropy traps and mitigating collapse. During policy updates, ECHO employs confidence adaptive clipping and an entropy confidence hybrid advantage shaping approach to enhance training robustness and mitigate early stage bias. Experiments demonstrate that ECHO achieves consistent gains on multiple mathematical and visual reasoning benchmarks, and generalizes more effectively under a limited rollout budget.",

Yet, dense and element-wise rounding matrices are prohibitively expensive for billion-parameter large language models (LLMs).

Unlike low-rank alternatives, VQRound minimizes the element-wise worst-case error under $L_\\infty$ norm, which is critical for handling heavy-tailed weight distributions in LLMs. Beyond reparameterization, we identify rounding initialization as a decisive factor and develop a lightweight end-to-end finetuning pipeline that optimizes codebooks across all layers using only 128 samples. Extensive experiments on OPT, LLaMA, LLaMA2, and Qwen3 models demonstrate that VQRound achieves better convergence than traditional adaptive rounding at the same number of steps while using as little as 0.2% of the trainable parameters. Our results show that adaptive rounding can be made both scalable and fast-fitting. The code is available at this https URL.",

Standard splines introduce high-frequency variations that force adaptive solvers to take excessively small steps, driving up the Number of Function Evaluations (NFE). We propose a novel approach to Neural CDE path construction that replaces exact interpolation with Kernel and Gaussian Process (GP) smoothing, enabling explicit control over trajectory regularity. To recover details lost during smoothing, we propose an attention-based Multi-View CDE (MV-CDE) and its convolutional extension (MVC-CDE), which employ learnable queries to inform path reconstruction. This framework allows the model to distribute representational capacity across multiple trajectories, each capturing distinct temporal patterns. Empirical results demonstrate that our method, MVC-CDE with GP, achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while significantly reducing NFEs and total inference time compared to spline-based baselines.",

We first introduce a structural equation model for continuous-time event sequences that supports both excitatory and inhibitory effects, and then extend this mechanism to temporal interaction graphs. To compare causal models, we propose a distance metric based on cross-model predictive error, and empirically validate the hypothesis that predictors trained on one causal model degrade when evaluated on sufficiently distant models.

Existing methods perform token routing based on sliding-window partitions, resulting in position-based selection and fails to capture token-specific global importance. Meanwhile, linear attention further suffers from distribution shift caused by learnable feature maps that distort pretrained feature magnitudes. Motivated by these limitations, we propose STILL, an intra-layer hybrid linearization framework for efficiently linearizing LLMs. STILL introduces a Self-Saliency Score with strong local-global consistency, enabling accurate token selection using sliding-window computation, and retains salient tokens for sparse softmax attention while summarizing the remaining context via linear attention. To preserve pretrained representations, we design a Norm-Preserved Feature Map (NP-Map) that decouples feature direction from magnitude and reinjects pretrained norms. We further adopt a unified training-inference architecture with chunk-wise parallelization and delayed selection to improve hardware efficiency. Experiments show that STILL matches or surpasses the original pretrained model on commonsense and general reasoning tasks, and achieves up to a 86.2% relative improvement over prior linearized attention methods on long-context benchmarks.",

We present ECHO-2, a distributed RL framework for post-training with remote inference workers and non-negligible dissemination latency. ECHO-2 combines centralized learning with distributed rollouts and treats bounded policy staleness as a user-controlled parameter, enabling rollout generation, dissemination, and training to overlap. We introduce an overlap-based capacity model that relates training time, dissemination latency, and rollout throughput, yielding a practical provisioning rule for sustaining learner utilization. To mitigate dissemination bottlenecks and lower cost, ECHO-2 employs peer-assisted pipelined broadcast and cost-aware activation of heterogeneous workers. Experiments on GRPO post-training of 4B and 8B models under real wide-area bandwidth regimes show that ECHO-2 significantly improves cost efficiency while preserving RL reward comparable to strong baselines.",

We uncover a fundamental phenomenon termed State Rank Stratification, characterized by a distinct spectral bifurcation among linear attention heads: while one group maintains an effective rank oscillating near zero, the other exhibits rapid growth that converges to an upper bound. Extensive experiments across diverse inference contexts reveal that these dynamics remain strikingly consistent, indicating that the identity of a head,whether low-rank or high-rank,is an intrinsic structural property acquired during pre-training, rather than a transient state dependent on the input data. Furthermore, our diagnostic probes reveal a surprising functional divergence: low-rank heads are indispensable for model reasoning, whereas high-rank heads exhibit significant redundancy. Leveraging this insight, we propose Joint Rank-Norm Pruning, a zero-shot strategy that achieves a 38.9\\% reduction in KV-cache overhead while largely maintaining model accuracy.",

In this paper, we propose Fat-Cat, a document-driven agent architecture that improves the signal-to-noise ratio of state management.

Extensive reasoning, retrieval, and coding benchmarks, Fat-Cat consistently improves agent performance. It enables the Kimi-k2 model to outperform the proprietary GPT-4o baseline on HotPotQA. Replacing the document-based state with JSON leads to performance drop, while empirically validating the critical necessity of document-driven state modeling over rigid syntax.

What is missing is a principled way to consolidate explanatory information about a fixed black-box model into a persistent, auditable artefact, that accompanies the black-box throughout its life cycle. We address this gap by introducing the notion of a scientific theory of a black (SToBB). Grounded in Constructive Empiricism, a SToBB fulfils three obligations: (i) empirical adequacy with respect to all available observations of black-box behaviour, (ii) adaptability via explicit update commitments that restore adequacy when new observations arrive, and (iii) auditability through transparent documentation of assumptions, construction choices, and update behaviour. We operationalise these obligations as a general framework that specifies an extensible observation base, a traceable hypothesis class, algorithmic components for construction and revision, and documentation sufficient for third-party assessment. Explanations for concrete stakeholder needs are then obtained by querying the maintained record through interfaces, rather than by producing isolated method outputs. As a proof of concept, we instantiate a complete SToBB for a neural-network classifier on a tabular task and introduce the Constructive Box Theoriser (CoBoT) algorithm, an online procedure that constructs and maintains an empirically adequate rule-based surrogate as observations accumulate. Together, these contributions position SToBBs as a life cycle-scale, inspectable point of reference that supports consistent, reusable analyses and systematic external scrutiny.",

To address this issue, we introduce TopoDiff, a geometry- and relation-aware diffusion model for EEG spatial super-resolution. Inspired by how human experts interpret spatial EEG patterns, TopoDiff incorporates topology-aware image embeddings derived from EEG topographic representations to provide global geometric context for spatial generation, together with a dynamic channel-relation graph that encodes inter-electrode relationships and evolves with temporal dynamics. This design yields a spatially grounded EEG spatial super-resolution framework with consistent performance improvements. Across multiple EEG datasets spanning diverse applications, including SEED/SEED-IV for emotion recognition, PhysioNet motor imagery (MI/MM), and TUSZ for seizure detection, our method achieves substantial gains in generation fidelity and leads to notable improvements in downstream EEG task performance.",

In response, existing interpretability approaches in the field keep focusing on explaining the internal model computations, without addressing whether they align or not with how a human would reason about the studied phenomenon. Instead, we state interpretability in deep time series models should pursue semantic alignment: predictions should be expressed in terms of variables that are meaningful to the end user, mediated by spatial and temporal mechanisms that admit user-dependent constraints. In this paper, we formalize this requirement and require that, once established, semantic alignment must be preserved under temporal evolution: a constraint with no analog in static settings. Provided with this definition, we outline a blueprint for semantically aligned deep time series models, identify properties that support trust, and discuss implications for model design.",

In practice, recent approaches optimize a weak dual EOT objective depending on a single potential, but doing so is computationally not efficient due to the intractable log-partition term. Existing methods typically resolve this obstacle in one of two ways: by significantly restricting the transport family to obtain closed-form normalization (via Gaussian-mixture parameterizations), or by using general neural parameterizations that require simulation-based training procedures. We propose Variational Entropic Optimal Transport (VarEOT), based on an exact variational reformulation of the log-partition $\\log \\mathbb{E}[\\exp(\\cdot)]$ as a tractable minimization over an auxiliary positive normalizer. This yields a differentiable learning objective optimized with stochastic gradients and avoids the necessity of MCMC simulations during the training. We provide theoretical guarantees, including finite-sample generalization bounds and approximation results under universal function approximation. Experiments on synthetic data and unpaired image-to-image translation demonstrate competitive or improved translation quality, while comparisons within the solvers that use the same weak dual EOT objective support the benefit of the proposed optimization principle.",

Adding entropy regularization during SFT is not a cure-all; it tends to flatten token distributions toward uniformity, increasing entropy without improving meaningful exploration capability. In this paper, we propose CurioSFT, an entropy-preserving SFT method designed to enhance exploration capabilities through intrinsic curiosity. It consists of (a) Self-Exploratory Distillation, which distills the model toward a self-generated, temperature-scaled teacher to encourage exploration within its capability; and (b) Entropy-Guided Temperature Selection, which adaptively adjusts distillation strength to mitigate knowledge forgetting by amplifying exploration at reasoning tokens while stabilizing factual tokens. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that, in SFT stage, CurioSFT outperforms the vanilla SFT by 2.5 points on in-distribution tasks and 2.9 points on out-of-distribution tasks. We also verify that exploration capabilities preserved during SFT successfully translate into concrete gains in RL stage, yielding an average improvement of 5.0 points.",

As a result, downstream fine-tuning can degrade alignment and fail to correct pre-existing misaligned behavior. We propose an alignment-aware fine-tuning framework that integrates feedback from an external alignment signal through policy-gradient-based regularization. Our method introduces an adaptive gating mechanism that dynamically balances supervised and alignment-driven gradients on a per-sample basis, prioritizing uncertain or misaligned cases while allowing well-aligned examples to follow standard supervised updates. The framework further learns abstention behavior for fully misaligned inputs, incorporating conservative responses directly into the fine-tuned model. Experiments on general and domain-specific instruction-tuning benchmarks demonstrate consistent reductions in harmful and hallucinated outputs without sacrificing downstream task performance. Additional analyses show robustness to adversarial fine-tuning, prompt-based attacks, and unsafe initializations, establishing adaptively gated alignment optimization as an effective approach for alignment-preserving and alignment-recovering model adaptation.",

Strong theoretical results are known in this setting, achieving nearly-tight $\\Theta(\\sqrt{T})$-regret bounds. However, such detailed feedback can be unrealistic, and recent research has investigated more restricted settings such as trajectory feedback, where the agent observes all the visited state-action pairs, but only a single \\emph{aggregate} reward. In this paper, we consider a far more restrictive ``fully bandit'' feedback model for episodic MDPs, where the agent does not even observe the visited state-action pairs -- it only learns the aggregate reward. We provide the first efficient bandit learning algorithm for episodic MDPs with $\\widetilde{O}(\\sqrt{T})$ regret. Our regret has an exponential dependence on the horizon length $\\H$, which we show is necessary. We also obtain improved nearly-tight regret bounds for ``ordered'' MDPs; these can be used to model classical stochastic optimization problems such as $k$-item prophet inequality and sequential posted pricing. Finally, we evaluate the empirical performance of our algorithm for the setting of $k$-item prophet inequalities; despite the highly restricted feedback, our algorithm's performance is comparable to that of a state-of-art learning algorithm (UCB-VI) with detailed state-action feedback.",

Interaction Field Matching (IFM) is a newer framework that generalizes Electrostatic Field Matching (EFM) rooted in Poisson Flow Generative Models (PFGM). While both frameworks define generative dynamics, they start from different objects: CFM specifies a conditional probability path in data space, whereas IFM specifies a physics-inspired interaction field in an augmented data space. This raises a basic question: are CFM and IFM genuinely different, or are they two descriptions of the same underlying dynamics? We show that they coincide for a natural subclass of IFM that we call forward-only IFM. Specifically, we construct a bijection between CFM and forward-only IFM. We further show that general IFM is strictly more expressive: it includes EFM and other interaction fields that cannot be realized within the standard CFM formulation. Finally, we highlight how this duality can benefit both frameworks: it provides a probabilistic interpretation of forward-only IFM and yields novel, IFM-driven techniques for CFM.",

We introduce HopFormer, a graph Transformer that injects structure exclusively through head-specific n-hop masked sparse attention, without the use of positional encodings or architectural modifications. This design provides explicit and interpretable control over receptive fields while enabling genuinely sparse attention whose computational cost scales linearly with mask sparsity. Through extensive experiments on both node-level and graph-level benchmarks, we demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive or superior performance across diverse graph structures. Our results further reveal that dense global attention is often unnecessary: on graphs with strong small-world properties, localized attention yields more stable and consistently high performance, while on graphs with weaker small-world effects, global attention offers diminishing returns. Together, these findings challenge prevailing assumptions in graph Transformer design and highlight sparsity-controlled attention as a principled and efficient alternative.",

To bridge this gap, we introduce MoLF (Mixture-of-Latent-Flow), a generative model for pan-cancer histogenomic prediction. MoLF leverages a conditional Flow Matching objective to map noise to the gene latent manifold, parameterized by a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) velocity field. By dynamically routing inputs to specialized sub-networks, this architecture effectively decouples the optimization of diverse tissue patterns. Our experiments demonstrate that MoLF establishes a new state-of-the-art, consistently outperforming both specialized and foundation model baselines on pan-cancer benchmarks. Furthermore, MoLF exhibits zero-shot generalization to cross-species data, suggesting it captures fundamental, conserved histo-molecular mechanisms.",

Existing methods focus on final-answer correctness, providing limited insight into how reasoning unfolds across intermediate steps. We present EvalQReason, a framework that quantifies LLM reasoning quality through step-level probability distribution analysis without requiring human annotation. The framework introduces two complementary algorithms: Consecutive Step Divergence (CSD), which measures local coherence between adjacent reasoning steps, and Step-to-Final Convergence (SFC), which assesses global alignment with final answers. Each algorithm employs five statistical metrics to capture reasoning dynamics. Experiments across mathematical and medical datasets with open-source 7B-parameter models demonstrate that CSD-based features achieve strong predictive performance for correctness classification, with classical machine learning models reaching F1=0.78 and ROC-AUC=0.82, and sequential neural models substantially improving performance (F1=0.88, ROC-AUC=0.97). CSD consistently outperforms SFC, and sequential architectures outperform classical machine learning approaches. Critically, reasoning dynamics prove domain-specific: mathematical reasoning exhibits clear divergence-based discrimination patterns between correct and incorrect solutions, while medical reasoning shows minimal discriminative signals, revealing fundamental differences in how LLMs process different reasoning types. EvalQReason enables scalable, process-aware evaluation of reasoning reliability, establishing probability-based divergence analysis as a principled approach for trustworthy AI deployment.",

        "abstract": "Can Large language models (LLMs) learn to reason without any weight update and only through in-context learning (ICL)? ICL is strikingly sample-efficient, often learning from only a handful of demonstrations, but complex reasoning tasks typically demand many training examples to learn from. However, naively scaling ICL by adding more demonstrations breaks down at this scale: attention costs grow quadratically, performance saturates or degrades with longer contexts, and the approach remains a shallow form of learning. Due to these limitations, practitioners predominantly rely on in-weight learning (IWL) to induce reasoning. In this work, we show that by using Prefix Tuning, LLMs can learn to reason without overloading the context window and without any weight updates. We introduce $\\textbf{ReasonCACHE}$, an instantiation of this mechanism that distills demonstrations into a fixed key-value cache. Empirically, across challenging reasoning benchmarks, including GPQA-Diamond, ReasonCACHE outperforms standard ICL and matches or surpasses IWL approaches. Further, it achieves this all while being more efficient across three key axes: data, inference cost, and trainable parameters. We also theoretically prove that ReasonCACHE can be strictly more expressive than low-rank weight update since the latter ties expressivity to input rank, whereas ReasonCACHE bypasses this constraint by directly injecting key-values into the attention mechanism. Together, our findings identify ReasonCACHE as a middle path between in-context and in-weight learning, providing a scalable algorithm for learning reasoning skills beyond the context window without modifying parameters.

Latest approaches have streamlined the alignment process by deriving implicit reward functions, yet they often suffer from a critical objective mismatch: optimizing the relative margin between chosen and rejected responses does not guarantee the preservation of the chosen response's absolute likelihood. This can lead to ``unlearning'', where the model degrades the probability of high-quality outputs to satisfy margin constraints, and ``formatting collapse'' caused by the over-penalization of rejected sequences. In this work, we introduce SLIME (Stabilized Likelihood Implicit Margin Enforcement), a reference-free alignment objective designed to decouple preference learning from generation quality. SLIME incorporates a three-pronged objective: (1) an anchoring term to maximize the likelihood of preferred responses; (2) a stabilizing penalty that prevents the probabilities of rejected tokens from collapsing to zero; and (3) a dual-margin mechanism that combines hard and soft constraints for precise boundary shaping. Our results demonstrate that SLIME achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining higher generation stability.",

We formalize two representational hypotheses: (1) a representation in the product space of all factors, whose dimension grows exponentially with the number of parts, or (2) a factored representation in orthogonal subspaces, whose dimension grows linearly. The factored representation is lossless when factors are conditionally independent, but sacrifices predictive fidelity otherwise, creating a tradeoff between dimensional efficiency and accuracy. We derive precise predictions about the geometric structure of activations for each, including the number of subspaces, their dimensionality, and the arrangement of context embeddings within them. We test between these hypotheses on transformers trained on synthetic processes with known latent structure. Models learn factored representations when factors are conditionally independent, and continue to favor them early in training even when noise or hidden dependencies undermine conditional independence, reflecting an inductive bias toward factoring at the cost of fidelity. This provides a principled explanation for why transformers decompose the world into parts, and suggests that interpretable low dimensional structure may persist even in models trained on complex data.",

We formalize this threat model as Tag-Along Attacks: a scenario where a tool-less adversary \"tags along\" on the trusted privileges of a safety-aligned Operator to induce prohibited tool use through conversation alone. To validate this threat, we present Slingshot, a 'cold-start' reinforcement learning framework that autonomously discovers emergent attack vectors, revealing a critical insight: in our setting, learned attacks tend to converge to short, instruction-like syntactic patterns rather than multi-turn persuasion. On held-out extreme-difficulty tasks, Slingshot achieves a 67.0% success rate against a Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct-AWQ Operator (vs. 1.7% baseline), reducing the expected attempts to first success (on solved tasks) from 52.3 to 1.3. Crucially, Slingshot transfers zero-shot to several model families, including closed-source models like Gemini 2.5 Flash (56.0% attack success rate) and defensive-fine-tuned open-source models like Meta-SecAlign-8B (39.2% attack success rate). Our work establishes Tag-Along Attacks as a first-class, verifiable threat model and shows that effective agentic attacks can be elicited from off-the-shelf open-weight models through environment interaction alone.",

By injecting controlled synthetic uniformly random noise into otherwise clean datasets, we analyze training dynamics across model sizes ranging from 480M to 5.2B parameters. We show that noisy data indeed induces training loss divergence, and that the probability of divergence depends strongly on the noise type, amount of noise, and model scale. We further find that noise-induced divergences exhibit activation patterns distinct from those caused by high learning rates, and we provide diagnostics that differentiate these two failure modes. Together, these results provide a large-scale, controlled characterization of how noisy data affects loss divergence in LLM pretraining.",

However, many difficult problems remain intractable for even current frontier models, preventing the extraction of valid training signals. A promising alternative is to leverage high-quality expert human solutions, yet naive imitation of this data fails because it is fundamentally out of distribution: expert solutions are typically didactic, containing implicit reasoning gaps intended for human readers rather than computational models. Furthermore, high-quality expert solutions are expensive, necessitating generalizable sample-efficient training methods. We propose Distribution Aligned Imitation Learning (DAIL), a two-step method that bridges the distributional gap by first transforming expert solutions into detailed, in-distribution reasoning traces and then applying a contrastive objective to focus learning on expert insights and methodologies. We find that DAIL can leverage fewer than 1000 high-quality expert solutions to achieve 10-25% pass@k gains on Qwen2.5-Instruct and Qwen3 models, improve reasoning efficiency by 2x to 4x, and enable out-of-domain generalization.",

While active learning can dramatically reduce labeling cost when annotations are expensive, early performance is frequently dominated by the initial seed set, typically chosen at random. In many applications, however, related or approximate datasets are readily available and can be leveraged to construct a better seed set. We introduce a new method for selecting the seed data set for active learning, Active-Transfer Bagging (ATBagging). ATBagging estimates the informativeness of candidate data point from a Bayesian interpretation of bagged ensemble models by comparing in-bag and out-of-bag predictive distributions from the labeled dataset, yielding an information-gain proxy. To avoid redundant selections, we impose feature-space diversity by sampling a determinantal point process (DPP) whose kernel uses Random Fourier Features and a quality-diversity factorization that incorporates the informativeness scores. This same blended method is used for selection of new data points to collect during the active learning phase. We evaluate ATBagging on four real-world datasets covering both target-transfer and feature-shift scenarios (QM9, ERA5, Forbes 2000, and Beijing PM2.5). Across seed sizes nseed = 10-100, ATBagging improves or ties early active learning and increases area under the learning-curve relative to alternative seed subset selection methodologies in almost all cases, with strongest benefits in low-data regimes. Thus, ATBagging provides a low-cost, high reward means to initiating active learning-based data collection.",

However, numerous recent works have shown that it is unable to perform basic tasks involving detecting triples of correlated tokens, or compositional tasks where multiple input tokens need to be referenced to generate a result. Some higher-dimensional alternatives to self-attention have been proposed to address this, including higher-order attention and Strassen attention, which can perform some of these polyadic tasks in exchange for slower, superquadratic running times. In this work, we define a vast class of generalizations of self-attention, which we call poly-attention mechanisms. Our mechanisms can incorporate arbitrary higher-order (tensor) computations as well as arbitrary relationship structures between the input tokens, and they include the aforementioned alternatives as special cases. We then systematically study their computational complexity and representational strength, including giving new algorithms and matching complexity-theoretic lower bounds on the time complexity of computing the attention matrix exactly as well as approximately, and tightly determining which polyadic tasks they can each perform. Our results give interesting trade-offs between different desiderata for these mechanisms, including a tight relationship between how expressive a mechanism is, and how large the coefficients in the model may be so that the mechanism can be approximated in almost-linear time. Notably, we give a new attention mechanism which can be computed exactly in quadratic time, and which can perform function composition for any fixed number of functions. Prior mechanisms, even for just composing two functions, could only be computed in superquadratic time, and our new lower bounds show that faster algorithms for them are not possible.",

For LLM reasoning tasks, it is essential to estimate the uncertainty not only for the final answer, but also for the intermediate steps of the reasoning, as this can enable more fine-grained and targeted interventions. In this study, we explore what UQ metrics better reflect the LLM's ``intermediate uncertainty''during reasoning. Our study reveals that an LLMs' incorrect reasoning steps tend to contain tokens which are highly sensitive to the perturbations on the preceding token embeddings. In this way, incorrect (uncertain) intermediate steps can be readily identified using this sensitivity score as guidance in practice. In our experiments, we show such perturbation-based metric achieves stronger uncertainty quantification performance compared with baseline methods such as token (generation) probability and token entropy. Besides, different from approaches that rely on multiple sampling, the perturbation-based metrics offer better simplicity and efficiency.",

Fine-grained MoE, featuring hundreds of well-trained experts per layer and multi-expert activation per token, offers an unexplored alternative through its rich routing space. We empirically characterize fine-grained MoE routing and uncover an informative pattern: router scores exhibit a certain head of high-confidence experts followed by an uncertain tail of low-confidence candidates. While single-run greedy accuracy remains stable when fewer experts are activated, multi-sample pass@n degrades significantly-suggesting that the certain head governs core reasoning capability while the uncertain tail correlates with reasoning diversity. Motivated by these findings, we propose Expert-Sample, a training-free method that preserves high-confidence selections while injecting controlled stochasticity into the uncertain tail, enabling diverse generation without destabilizing outputs. Evaluated on multiple fine-grained MoE models across math, knowledge reasoning, and code tasks, Expert-Sample consistently improves pass@n and verification-based accuracy. On Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct evaluated on GPQA-Diamond with 32 parallel samples, pass@32 rises from 85.4% to 91.9%, and accuracy improves from 59.1% to 62.6% with Best-of-N verification.",

To obtain explicit finite-sample guarantees for the last iterate, we develop a coupling argument that compares the discrete-time process to a limiting Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. Our analysis applies to algorithms driven by general noise conditions, including martingale differences and functions of ergodic Markov chains. Complementing this result, we handle the convergence rate of the Polyak-Ruppert average through a direct analysis that applies under the same general setting. Assuming the driving noise satisfies a non-asymptotic central limit theorem, we show that the normalized last iterates converge to a Gaussian distribution in the $p$-Wasserstein distance at a rate of order $\\gamma_n^{1/6}$, where $\\gamma_n$ is the step size. Similarly, the Polyak-Ruppert average is shown to converge in the Wasserstein distance at a rate of order $n^{-1/6}$. These distributional guarantees imply high-probability concentration inequalities that improve upon those derived from moment bounds and Markov's inequality. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by considering two applications: (1) linear stochastic approximation, where we explicitly quantify the transition from heavy-tailed to Gaussian behavior of the iterates, thereby bridging the gap between recent finite-sample analyses and asymptotic theory and (2) stochastic gradient descent, where we establish rate of convergence to the central limit theorem.",

Traditional approaches such as random sampling, greedy information maximization, and round-robin coverage treat each decision in isolation, unable to learn adaptive strategies from experience. We propose Active Causal Experimentalist (ACE), which learns experimental design as a sequential policy. Our key insight is that while absolute information gains diminish as knowledge accumulates (making value-based RL unstable), relative comparisons between candidate interventions remain meaningful throughout. ACE exploits this via Direct Preference Optimization, learning from pairwise intervention comparisons rather than non-stationary reward magnitudes. Across synthetic benchmarks, physics simulations, and economic data, ACE achieves 70-71% improvement over baselines at equal intervention budgets (p < 0.001, Cohen's d ~ 2). Notably, the learned policy autonomously discovers that collider mechanisms require concentrated interventions on parent variables, a theoretically-grounded strategy that emerges purely from experience. This suggests preference-based learning can recover principled experimental strategies, complementing theory with learned domain adaptation.",

Despite these benefits, traditional single-server FL suffers from high communication latency due to the aggregation of models from a large number of clients. While multi-server FL distributes workloads across edge servers, overlapping client coverage and uncoordinated selection often lead to resource contention, causing bandwidth conflicts and training failures. To address these limitations, we propose a decentralized reinforcement learning with conflict risk prediction, named RL CRP, to optimize client selection in multi-server FL systems. Specifically, each server estimates the likelihood of client selection conflicts using a categorical hidden Markov model based on its sparse historical client selection sequence. Then, a fairness-aware reward mechanism is incorporated to promote long-term client participation for minimizing training latency and resource contention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed RL-CRP framework effectively reduces inter-server conflicts and significantly improves training efficiency in terms of convergence speed and communication cost.",

While prior work has extensively explored depth expansion, width expansion remains significantly understudied, with the few existing methods limited to the early stages of training.

Empirically, we show that naive initialization at this stage disrupts activation statistics, triggering loss spikes, while copy-based initialization introduces gradient symmetry that hinders feature diversity.

At the other extreme, distillation offers dense supervision but requires demonstrations, which are costly and difficult to scale. We study text feedback as an intermediate signal: richer than scalar rewards, yet cheaper than complete demonstrations. Textual feedback is a natural mode of human interaction and is already abundant in many real-world settings, where users, annotators, and automated judges routinely critique LLM outputs. Towards leveraging text feedback at scale, we formalize a multi-turn RL setup, RL from Text Feedback (RLTF), where text feedback is available during training but not at inference. Therefore, models must learn to internalize the feedback in order to improve their test-time single-turn performance. To do this, we propose two methods: Self Distillation (RLTF-SD), which trains the single-turn policy to match its own feedback-conditioned second-turn generations; and Feedback Modeling (RLTF-FM), which predicts the feedback as an auxiliary objective. We provide theoretical analysis on both methods, and empirically evaluate on reasoning puzzles, competition math, and creative writing tasks. Our results show that both methods consistently outperform strong baselines across benchmarks, highlighting the potential of RL with an additional source of rich supervision at scale.",

Thus, we propose MEG-XL, a model pre-trained with 2.5 minutes of MEG context per sample, 5-300x longer than prior work, and equivalent to 191k tokens, capturing extended neural context. Fine-tuning on the task of word decoding from brain data, MEG-XL matches supervised performance with a fraction of the data (e.g. 1hr vs 50hrs) and outperforms brain foundation models.

Existing approaches often make strong assumptions that training and test data come from the same distribution. However, the data distribution varies since user interests are constantly evolving, resulting in the out-of-distribution (OOD) issue. In addition, users tend to have multiple interests, some of which evolve faster than others. Towards this end, we propose Disentangled Click-Through Rate prediction (DiseCTR), which introduces a causal perspective of recommendation and disentangles multiple aspects of user interests to alleviate the OOD issue in recommendation. We conduct a causal factorization of CTR prediction involving user interest, exposure model, and click model, based on which we develop a deep learning implementation for these three causal mechanisms. Specifically, we first design an interest encoder with sparse attention which maps raw features to user interests, and then introduce a weakly supervised interest disentangler to learn independent interest embeddings, which are further integrated by an attentive interest aggregator for prediction. Experimental results on three real-world datasets show that DiseCTR achieves the best accuracy and robustness in OOD recommendation against state-of-the-art approaches, significantly improving AUC and GAUC by over 0.02 and reducing logloss by over 13.7%. Further analyses demonstrate that DiseCTR successfully disentangles user interests, which is the key to OOD generalization for CTR prediction. We have released the code and data at this https URL.",

However, existing instruction-tuned attributed LLMs often fail to properly interpret the contextual semantics of citation symbols (e.g., [i]) during text generation. This shortcoming arises from their insufficient awareness of the context information surrounding citation markers, which in turn leads to disjointed references and poor integration of retrieved knowledge into the generated content. To address this issue, we propose a novel \\textbf{C}ontextual-aware \\textbf{C}itation generation framework (\\textbf{C$^2$}-\\textbf{Cite}) that explicitly integrates the semantic relationships between citation markers and their referenced content. Specifically, a contextual citation alignment mechanism is adopted: it first encodes the retrieved document contexts into the symbol representation of citations, then aligns the marker numbers by decoding information from a citation router function. This mechanism enables the transformation of citation markers from generic placeholders into active knowledge pointers that link to the referenced source information. Experimental results on the ALCE benchmark across three datasets validate our framework C$^2$-Cite++: it outperforms the SOTA baseline by an average of 5.8\\% in citation quality and 17.4\\% in response correctness.

        "abstract": "In e-commerce ranking, implicit user feedback is systematically confounded by Position Bias -- the strong propensity of users to interact with top-ranked items regardless of relevance. While Deep Learning architectures (e.g., Two-Tower Networks) are the standard solution for de-biasing, we demonstrate that in High-Bias Regimes, state-of-the-art Deep Ensembles suffer from Shortcut Learning: they minimize training loss by overfitting to the rank signal, leading to degraded ranking quality despite high prediction accuracy. We propose Linear Position-bias Aware Learning (Linear-PAL), a lightweight framework that enforces de-biasing through structural constraints: explicit feature conjunctions and aggressive regularization. We further introduce a Vectorized Integer Hashing technique for feature generation, replacing string-based operations with $O(N)$ vectorized arithmetic. Evaluating on a large-scale dataset (4.2M samples), Linear-PAL achieves Pareto Dominance: it outperforms Deep Ensembles in de-biased ranking quality (Relevance AUC: 0.7626 vs. 0.6736) while reducing training latency by 43x (40s vs 1762s). This computational efficiency enables high-frequency retraining, allowing the system to capture user-specific emerging market trends and deliver robust, personalized ranking in near real-time.",

        "abstract": "Networks in the current 5G and beyond systems increasingly carry heterogeneous traffic with diverse quality-of-service constraints, making real-time routing decisions both complex and time-critical. A common approach, such as a heuristic with human intervention or training a single centralized RL policy or synchronizing updates across multiple learners, struggles with scalability and straggler effects. We address this by proposing an asynchronous multi-agent reinforcement learning (AMARL) framework in which independent PPO agents, one per service, plan routes in parallel and commit resource deltas to a shared global resource environment. This coordination by state preserves feasibility across services and enables specialization for service-specific objectives. We evaluate the method on an O-RAN like network simulation using nearly real-time traffic data from the city of Montreal. We compared against a single-agent PPO baseline. AMARL achieves a similar Grade of Service (acceptance rate) (GoS) and end-to-end latency, with reduced training wall-clock time and improved robustness to demand shifts. These results suggest that asynchronous, service-specialized agents provide a scalable and practical approach to distributed routing, with applicability extending beyond the O-RAN domain.",

The availability of large-scale data and advanced computational power enables the development of sophisticated models and training strategies, leading to state-of-the-art performance, but it also introduces substantial challenges. Quantum Computing (QC), which exploits quantum mechanisms for computation, has attracted growing attention and significant global investment as it may address these challenges. Consequently, Quantum Machine Learning (QML), the integration of these two fields, has received increasing interest, with a notable rise in related studies in recent years. We are motivated to review these existing contributions regarding quantum circuit-based learning models for classical data analysis and highlight the identified potentials and challenges of this technique. Specifically, we focus not only on QML models, both kernel-based and neural network-based, but also on recent explorations of their integration with classical machine learning layers within hybrid frameworks. Moreover, we examine both theoretical analysis and empirical findings to better understand their capabilities, and we also discuss the efforts on noise-resilient and hardware-efficient QML that could enhance its practicality under current hardware limitations. In addition, we cover several emerging paradigms for advanced quantum circuit design and highlight the adaptability of QML across representative application domains. This study aims to provide an overview of the contributions made to bridge quantum computing and machine learning, offering insights and guidance to support its future development and pave the way for broader adoption in the coming years.",

Modeling dynamics in the balancing market can provide valuable insights and prognosis for power grid stability and secure energy supply. While complex machine learning models can achieve high accuracy, their black-box nature severely limits the model interpretability. In this paper, we explore the trade-off between model accuracy and interpretability for the energy balancing market. Particularly, we take the example of forecasting manual frequency restoration reserve (mFRR) activation price in the balancing market using real market data from different energy price zones. We explore the interpretability of mFRR forecasting using two models: extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) machine and explainable boosting machine (EBM). We also integrate the two models, and we benchmark all the models against a baseline naive model. Our results show that EBM provides forecasting accuracy comparable to XGBoost while yielding a considerable level of interpretability. Our analysis also underscores the challenge of accurately predicting the mFRR price for the instances when the activation price deviates significantly from the spot price. Importantly, EBM's interpretability features reveal insights into non-linear mFRR price drivers and regional market dynamics. Our study demonstrates that EBM is a viable and valuable interpretable alternative to complex black-box AI models in the forecast for the balancing market.",

In these settings, systems must balance competing requirements, including minimizing inference latency for real-time clinical decision support, maximizing throughput for batch processing of medical records, and ensuring strict adherence to data privacy standards such as HIPAA. This paper presents a rigorous benchmarking analysis comparing two prominent deployment paradigms: a lightweight, Python-based REST service using FastAPI, and a specialized, high-performance serving engine, NVIDIA Triton Inference Server. Leveraging a reference architecture for healthcare AI, we deployed a DistilBERT sentiment analysis model on Kubernetes to measure median (p50) and tail (p95) latency, as well as throughput, under controlled experimental conditions. Our results indicate a distinct trade-off. While FastAPI provides lower overhead for single-request workloads with a p50 latency of 22 ms, Triton achieves superior scalability through dynamic batching, delivering a throughput of 780 requests per second on a single NVIDIA T4 GPU, nearly double that of the baseline. Furthermore, we evaluate a hybrid architectural approach that utilizes FastAPI as a secure gateway for protected health information de-identification and Triton for backend inference. This study validates the hybrid model as a best practice for enterprise clinical AI and offers a blueprint for secure, high-availability deployments.",

Results showed that gradient boosting on the original features performed best. XGBoost achieved 0.9747 accuracy, 0.9703 precision, 0.9731 recall, and 0.9716 F1, and the confusion matrix indicated rare benign labels for malicious apps. HistGradientBoosting reached 0.9741 accuracy and 0.9708 F1, while CatBoost and Random Forest were slightly lower at 0.9678 and 0.9687 accuracy with 0.9636 and 0.9637 F1. KNN and SVM lagged. PCA reduced performance for all models, with XGBoost dropping to 0.9164 accuracy and 0.8988 F1. LDA maintained mid 90s accuracy and clarified separable clusters in projections. A depth two surrogate tree highlighted package name, main activity, and target SDK as key drivers.

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in code generation, but their adherence to fine-grained user intent with multiple constraints remains a significant challenge. Our empirical analysis reveals two key observations: 1) Model performance deteriorates quickly as the number of constraints in the user intent increases, and 2) While user intent does influence the model's logits, such an influence may not be strong enough to effectively steer the decoding process. To this end, we propose Intent-Amplified Code Generation (IntentCoding), a novel decoding strategy that enhances an LLM's ability to follow user intent. IntentCoding captures the influence of user intent by masking out the intent, and applies a multi-strength ensemble mechanism to amplify the effect of user intent during generation. IntentCoding is model-agnostic, requires no additional training, and integrates seamlessly with existing decoding procedures. To enable systematic evaluation, we also construct CodeConstraints, a benchmark dataset specifically designed to test user intent compliance under varying numbers of constraints. Experiments on our constructed Constraints, as well as popular IFEvalCode, HumanEval and LiveCodeBench datasets, show that our IntentCoding model significantly improves both constraint satisfaction and functional correctness compared to standard decoding approaches. IntentCoding achieves up to 71.0% relative improvement on CodeConstraints, achieves up to 67.3% relative improvement on IFEvalCode and achieves up to 29.3% relative improvement in pass@1 on HumanEval and LiveCodeBench compared with greedy decoding.",

To enable practical computations, one employs finite-dimensional encoding/decoding theorems of the following kind: every continuous mapping $f$ between function spaces $E$ and $F$ is approximated in the topology of uniform convergence on compacta by continuous mappings factoring through two finite dimensional Banach spaces. Such a result is known (Kovachki et al., 2023) for $E,F$ being Banach spaces having the approximation property. We point out that the result needs no assumptions on $E,F$ whatsoever and remains true not only for all normed spaces, but for arbitrary locally convex spaces as well. At the same time, an analogous result for $C^k$-smooth mappings and the $C^k$ compact open topology, $k\\geq 1$, holds if and only if the space $E$ has the approximation property. This analysis may be useful already because non-normable locally convex function spaces are common in the theory of differential equations, the main field of applications for the emerging theory.",

As LLMs are deployed for adaptive testing and personalized tutoring, this question becomes urgent -- yet we cannot answer it with existing resources. Current educational datasets provide only question identifiers and binary correctness labels, rendering them opaque to LLMs that reason in natural language. We address this gap with FoundationalASSIST, the first English educational dataset providing the complete information needed for research on LLMs in education: full question text, actual student responses (not just right/wrong), records of which wrong answers students chose, and alignment to Common Core K-12 standards. These 1.7 million interactions from 5,000 students enable research directions that were previously impossible to pursue, from fine-tuning student models to analyzing misconception patterns. To demonstrate the dataset's utility, we evaluate four frontier models (GPT-OSS-120B, Llama-3.3-70B, Qwen3-Next-80B variants) on two complementary task families: Knowledge Tracing, testing whether LLMs can predict student performance on questions, and the exact answer a student will give; and \\textbf{Pedagogical Grounding}, testing whether LLMs understand the properties that make assessment items effective. Our evaluation reveals significant gaps in current LLM capabilities. Every model barely achieves a trivial baseline on knowledge tracing. All models fall below random chance on item discrimination, indicating that LLMs do not understand what makes one problem more diagnostic than another. Models do show competence at judging relative difficulty (up to 68.6%), but this partial success only highlights the gaps elsewhere. These results establish that substantial advances are needed before LLMs can reliably support personalized learning at scale.

We study a small-footprint test-time adaptation (TTA) framework for causal timeseries forecasting and direction classification.

For classification we minimize entropy and enforce temporal consistency; for regression we minimize prediction variance across weak time-preserving augmentations and optionally distill from an EMA teacher. A quadratic drift penalty and an uncertainty triggered fallback keep updates stable. We evaluate this framework in two stages: synthetic regime shifts on ETT benchmarks, and daily equity and FX series (SPY, QQQ, EUR/USD) across pandemic, high-inflation, and recovery regimes. On synthetic gradual drift, normalization-based TTA improves forecasting error, while in financial markets a simple batch-normalization statistics update is a robust default and more aggressive norm-only adaptation can even hurt.

This paper introduces the GT-Score, a composite objective function that integrates performance, statistical significance, consistency, and downside risk to guide optimization toward more robust trading strategies. This approach directly addresses critical pitfalls in quantitative strategy development, specifically data snooping during optimization and the unreliability of statistical inference under non-normal return distributions. Using historical stock data for 50 S&P 500 companies spanning 2010-2024, we conduct an empirical evaluation that includes walk-forward validation with nine sequential time splits and a Monte Carlo study with 15 random seeds across three trading strategies. In walk-forward validation, GT-Score improves the generalization ratio (validation return divided by training return) by 98% relative to baseline objective functions. Paired statistical tests on Monte Carlo out-of-sample returns indicate statistically detectable differences between objective functions (p < 0.01 for comparisons with Sortino and Simple), with small effect sizes. These results suggest that embedding an anti-overfitting structure into the objective can improve the reliability of backtests in quantitative research.

        "abstract": "Radiomics enables quantitative medical image analysis by converting imaging data into structured, high-dimensional feature representations for predictive modeling. Despite methodological developments and encouraging retrospective results, radiomics continue to face persistent challenges related to feature instability, limited reproducibility, validation bias, and restricted clinical translation. Existing reviews largely focus on application-specific outcomes or isolated pipeline components, with limited analysis of how interdependent design choices across acquisition, preprocessing, feature engineering, modeling, and evaluation collectively affect robustness and generalizability. This survey provides an end-to-end analysis of radiomics pipelines, examining how methodological decisions at each stage influence feature stability, model reliability, and translational validity. This paper reviews radiomic feature extraction, selection, and dimensionality reduction strategies; classical machine and deep learning-based modeling approaches; and ensemble and hybrid frameworks, with emphasis on validation protocols, data leakage prevention, and statistical reliability. Clinical applications are discussed with a focus on evaluation rigor rather than reported performance metrics. The survey identifies open challenges in standardization, domain shift, and clinical deployment, and outlines future directions such as hybrid radiomics-artificial intelligence models, multimodal fusion, federated learning, and standardized benchmarking.",

Through systematic comparison, six methods including diffusion maps (DM) are selected to construct low-dimensional representations. Based on these, a data-driven stochastic differential equation model is established to robustly estimate the probability evolution scoring function of the system. Building on this, a new Score Function (SF) indicator is defined by incorporating Schrödinger bridge theory to quantify the likelihood of significant state transitions in the system. Experiments demonstrate that this indicator exhibits higher sensitivity and robustness in epilepsy prediction, enables earlier identification of critical points, and clearly captures dynamic features across various stages before and after seizure onset.

However, modalities often contribute unequally and in a data dependent way, making it unclear which data modalities are genuinely informative and to what extent their contributions can be trusted. Quantifying modality level importance together with uncertainty is therefore central to interpretable and reliable multimodal learning. We introduce conformal Shapley intervals, a framework that combines Shapley values with conformal inference to construct uncertainty-aware importance intervals for each modality. Building on these intervals, we propose a modality selection procedure with a provable optimality guarantee: conditional on the observed features, the selected subset of modalities achieves performance close to that of the optimal subset. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on multiple datasets, showing that it provides meaningful uncertainty quantification and strong predictive performance while relying on only a small number of informative modalities.",

Most theoretical analyses focus on regression or on classification tasks with a positive margin, where worst-case gradient bounds suffice. In contrast, we study zero-margin nonlinear classification by analyzing the Gaussian XOR problem, where inputs are Gaussian and the XOR decision boundary determines labels. In this setting, a non-negligible fraction of data lies arbitrarily close to the boundary, breaking standard margin-based arguments. Building on Glasgow's (2024) analysis, we extend the study of training dynamics from discrete to Gaussian inputs and develop a framework for the dynamics of neuron blocks. We show that neurons cluster into four directions and that block-level signals evolve coherently, a phenomenon essential in the Gaussian setting where individual neuron signals vary significantly. Leveraging this block perspective, we analyze generalization without relying on margin assumptions, adopting an average-case view that distinguishes regions of reliable prediction from regions of persistent error. Numerical experiments confirm the predicted two-phase block dynamics and demonstrate their robustness beyond the Gaussian setting.",

Existing deep learning methods achieve considerable accuracy but often lack transparency, leading to error drift and reduced clinical trust. We propose a novel Multi-Hop Visual Chain of Reasoning (VCoR) framework that reformulates registration as a progressive reasoning process. Inspired by the iterative nature of clinical decision-making, each visual reasoning hop integrates a Localized Spatial Refinement (LSR) module to enrich feature representations and a Cross-Reference Attention (CRA) mechanism that leads the iterative refinement process, preserving anatomical consistency. This multi-hop strategy enables robust handling of large deformations and produces a transparent sequence of intermediate predictions with a theoretical bound. Beyond accuracy, our framework offers built-in interpretability by estimating uncertainty via the stability and convergence of deformation fields across hops. Extensive evaluations on two challenging public datasets, DIR-Lab 4D CT (lung) and IXI T1-weighted MRI (brain), demonstrate that VCoR achieves competitive registration accuracy while offering rich intermediate visualizations and confidence measures. By embedding an implicit visual reasoning paradigm, we present an interpretable, reliable, and clinically viable unsupervised medical image registration.",

This overlooks common information-seeking scenarios with multiple plausible answers, where diversity is essential to avoid collapsing to a single dominant response, thereby constraining creativity and compromising fair and inclusive information access. Our analysis reveals a commonly overlooked limitation of standard RAG systems: they underutilize retrieved context diversity, such that increasing retrieval diversity alone does not yield diverse generations. To address this limitation, we propose DIVERGE, a plug-and-play agentic RAG framework with novel reflection-guided generation and memory-augmented iterative refinement, which promotes diverse viewpoints while preserving answer quality. We introduce novel metrics tailored to evaluating the diversity-quality trade-off in open-ended questions, and show that they correlate well with human judgments. We demonstrate that DIVERGE achieves the best diversity-quality trade-off compared to competitive baselines and previous state-of-the-art methods on the real-world Infinity-Chat dataset, substantially improving diversity while maintaining quality.

Reliable Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) is critical for the trustworthy uptake of generated answers. Existing UQ approaches remain weakly validated in scientific QA, a domain relying on fact-retrieval and reasoning capabilities. We introduce the first large-scale benchmark for evaluating UQ metrics in reasoning-demanding QA studying calibration of UQ methods, providing an extensible open-source framework to reproducibly assess calibration. Our study spans up to 20 large language models of base, instruction-tuned and reasoning variants. Our analysis covers seven scientific QA datasets, including both multiple-choice and arithmetic question answering tasks, using prompting to emulate an open question answering setting. We evaluate and compare methods representative of prominent approaches on a total of 685,000 long-form responses, spanning different reasoning complexities representative of domain-specific tasks. At the token level, we find that instruction tuning induces strong probability mass polarization, reducing the reliability of token-level confidences as estimates of uncertainty. Models further fine-tuned for reasoning are exposed to the same effect, but the reasoning process appears to mitigate it depending on the provider. At the sequence level, we show that verbalized approaches are systematically biased and poorly correlated with correctness, while answer frequency (consistency across samples) yields the most reliable calibration. In the wake of our analysis, we study and report the misleading effect of relying exclusively on ECE as a sole measure for judging performance of UQ methods on benchmark datasets.

Although large volumes of CT images and reports are readily available in clinical picture archiving and communication systems (PACS), 3D segmentations of critical findings are costly to obtain, typically requiring extensive manual annotation by radiologists. On the other hand, it is common for radiologists to provide limited annotations of findings during routine reads, such as line measurements and arrows, that are often stored in PACS as GSPS objects. We posit that these sparse annotations can be extracted along with CT volumes and converted into 3D segmentations using promptable segmentation models, a paradigm we term Opportunistic Promptable Segmentation. To enable this paradigm, we propose SAM2CT, the first promptable segmentation model designed to convert radiologist annotations into 3D segmentations in CT volumes. SAM2CT builds upon SAM2 by extending the prompt encoder to support arrow and line inputs and by introducing Memory-Conditioned Memories (MCM), a memory encoding strategy tailored to 3D medical volumes. On public lesion segmentation benchmarks, SAM2CT outperforms existing promptable segmentation models and similarly trained baselines, achieving Dice similarity coefficients of 0.649 for arrow prompts and 0.757 for line prompts. Applying the model to pre-existing GSPS annotations from a clinical PACS (N = 60), SAM2CT generates 3D segmentations that are clinically acceptable or require only minor adjustments in 87% of cases, as scored by radiologists. Additionally, SAM2CT demonstrates strong zero-shot performance on select Emergency Department findings. These results suggest that large-scale mining of historical GSPS annotations represents a promising and scalable approach for generating 3D CT segmentation datasets.",

This analysis is rooted in first principles, focusing on the geometry of the four fundamental subspaces. We examine: (1) the reverse order law, $A^+ = R^+C^+$, which holds when $C$ has independent columns and $R$ has independent rows, (2) the universally correct formula, $A^+ = (C^+CR)^+(CRR^+)^+$, providing a geometric interpretation of the mappings between the involved subspaces, (3) a new generalized randomized formula, $A^+_p = (P^TA)^+P^TAQ(AQ)^+$, which gives $A^+_p = A^+$ if and only if the sketching matrices $P$ and $Q$ preserve the rank of $A$, i.e., $\\mathrm{rank}(P^TA) = \\mathrm{rank}(AQ) = \\mathrm{rank}(A)$. The framework is extended to generalized $\\{1,2\\}$-inverses and specialized forms, revealing the underlying structure of established randomized linear algebra algorithms, including randomized SVD, the Nyström approximation, and CUR decomposition. We demonstrate applications in sparse sensor placement and effective resistance estimation. For the latter, we provide a rigorous quantitative analysis of an approximation scheme, establishing that it always underestimates the true resistance and deriving a worst-case spectral bound on the error of resistance differences.",

We argue this cost is often unnecessary, particularly when weight matrices exhibit fast singular value decay. By parameterizing weights as $W = AB^{\\top}$ with $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times r}$, $B \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times r}$, we induce a posterior that is singular with respect to the Lebesgue measure, concentrating on the rank-$r$ manifold. This singularity captures structured weight correlations through shared latent factors, geometrically distinct from mean-field's independence assumption. We derive PAC-Bayes generalization bounds whose complexity term scales as $\\sqrt{r(m+n)}$ instead of $\\sqrt{m n}$, and prove loss bounds that decompose the error into optimization and rank-induced bias using the Eckart-Young-Mirsky theorem. We further adapt recent Gaussian complexity bounds for low-rank deterministic networks to Bayesian predictive means. Empirically, across MLPs, LSTMs, and Transformers on standard benchmarks, our method achieves predictive performance competitive with 5-member Deep Ensembles while using up to $15\\times$ fewer parameters.

Our approach is fully matrix-free and has the same complexity as ADAM (Kingma, 2024), $O(n)$ in both computation and memory costs. To ensure stable optimization in the presence of strong nonlinearity in the 3DGS rasterization process, we introduce a parameter-wise trust-region technique based on the squared Hellinger distance, regularizing updates to Gaussian parameters. Under identical parameter initialization and without densification, 3DGS$^2$-TR is able to achieve better reconstruction quality on standard datasets, using 50% fewer training iterations compared to ADAM, while incurring less than 1GB of peak GPU memory overhead (17% more than ADAM and 85% less than 3DGS-LM), enabling scalability to very large scenes and potentially to distributed training settings.",

        "abstract": "In the last decade, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in the control and decision-making of complex dynamical systems. However, most RL algorithms rely on the Markov Decision Process assumption, which is violated in practical cyber-physical systems affected by sensing delays, actuation latencies, and communication constraints. Such time delays introduce memory effects that can significantly degrade performance and compromise stability, particularly in networked and multi-agent environments. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of RL methods designed to address time delays in control systems. We first formalize the main classes of delays and analyze their impact on the Markov property. We then systematically categorize existing approaches into five major families: state augmentation and history-based representations, recurrent policies with learned memory, predictor-based and model-aware methods, robust and domain-randomized training strategies, and safe RL frameworks with explicit constraint handling. For each family, we discuss underlying principles, practical advantages, and inherent limitations. A comparative analysis highlights key trade-offs among these approaches and provides practical guidelines for selecting suitable methods under different delay characteristics and safety requirements. Finally, we identify open challenges and promising research directions, including stability certification, large-delay learning, multi-agent communication co-design, and standardized benchmarking. This survey aims to serve as a unified reference for researchers and practitioners developing reliable RL-based controllers in delay-affected cyber-physical systems.",

While many existing alignment methods primarily focus on fine-tuning pre-trained generative models to maximize a given reward function, these approaches require extensive computational resources and may not generalize well across different objectives. In this work, we propose a novel alignment framework by leveraging the underlying nature of the alignment problem -- sampling from reward-weighted distributions -- and show that it applies to both diffusion models (via score guidance) and flow matching models (via velocity guidance). The score function (velocity field) required for the reward-weighted distribution can be decomposed into the pre-trained score (velocity field) plus a conditional expectation of the reward. For the alignment on the diffusion model, we identify a fundamental challenge: the adversarial nature of the guidance term can introduce undesirable artifacts in the generated images. Therefore, we propose a finetuning-free framework that trains a guidance network to estimate the conditional expectation of the reward. We achieve comparable performance to finetuning-based models with one-step generation with at least a 60% reduction in computational cost. For the alignment on flow matching, we propose a training-free framework that improves the generation quality without additional computational cost.",

To this end, we introduce PolarMem, a training-free Polarized Latent Graph Memory designed to ground agent reasoning in verifiable evidence. PolarMem transforms fuzzy perceptual likelihoods into discrete logical constraints through non-parametric distributional partitioning. Furthermore, it employs a polarized graph topology with orthogonal inhibitory connections to explicitly store verified negation as a primary cognitive state. At inference time, we enforce a logic-dominant retrieval paradigm, suppressing hallucinatory patterns that violate negative constraints. Extensive evaluation across eight frozen Vision--Language Models and six benchmarks demonstrates that PolarMem functions as a robust cognitive system, establishing a foundation for verifiable multimodal agents.

While prior work on private contextual bandits has been restricted to linear reward models -- which admit closed-form estimators -- generalized linear models (GLMs) pose fundamental new challenges: no closed-form estimator exists, requiring private convex optimization; privacy must be tracked across multiple evolving design matrices; and optimization error must be explicitly incorporated into regret analysis. We address these challenges under two privacy models and context settings. For stochastic contexts, we design a shuffle-DP algorithm achieving $\\tilde{O}(d^{3/2}\\sqrt{T}/\\sqrt{\\varepsilon})$ regret. For adversarial contexts, we provide a joint-DP algorithm with $\\tilde{O}(d\\sqrt{T}/\\sqrt{\\varepsilon})$ regret -- matching the non-private rate up to a $1/\\sqrt{\\varepsilon}$ factor. Both algorithms remove dependence on the instance-specific parameter $\\kappa$ (which can be exponential in dimension) from the dominant $\\sqrt{T}$ term.

We quantify this bulk-tube contrast using a 0D persistent-homology functional, computed efficiently from Euclidean MST edge-length profiles. We prove consistency in a triangular-array small-noise regime, extend the method to fixed noise via a binned variant (TRA-s), and introduce TRA-C, a confounding-aware abstention rule calibrated by a Gaussian-copula plug-in bootstrap.

On two- and three-hop tasks, CODI forms the full set of bridge states that become decodable across latent-thought positions, while the final input follows a separate near-direct route; predictions arise via late fusion at the end-of-thought boundary. For longer hop lengths, CODI does not reliably execute a full latent rollout, instead exhibiting a partial latent reasoning path that concentrates on late intermediates and fuses them with the last input at the answer readout position. Ablations show that this partial pathway can collapse under regime shifts, including harder optimization. Overall, we delineate when CODI-style latent-CoT yields faithful iterative computation versus compressed or shortcut strategies, and highlight challenges in designing robust latent-CoT objectives for sequential reasoning.",

Specifically, a tailored Markov Decision Process is first formulated, where given optimization dynamics features, a deep Q-network-based policy controls the constraint relaxation level along the underlying optimization process. Such adaptive constraint handling provides flexible tradeoff between objective-oriented exploitation and feasible-region-oriented exploration, and hence leads to promising optimization performance. We train our approach on CEC 2017 Constrained Optimization benchmark with limited evaluation budget condition (expensive cases) and compare the trained constraint handling policy to strong baselines such as recent winners in CEC/GECCO competitions. Extensive experimental results show that our approach performs competitively or even surpasses the compared baselines under either Leave-one-out cross-validation or ordinary train-test split validation.

A key aspect that impacts SAEAs' effectiveness is surrogate model selection, which in existing works is predominantly decided by human developer. Such human-made design choice introduces strong bias into SAEAs and may hurt their expected performance on out-of-scope tasks. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning-assisted ensemble framework, termed as SEEMOO, which is capable of scheduling different surrogate models within a single optimization process, hence boosting the overall optimization performance in a cooperative paradigm. Specifically, we focus on expensive multi-objective optimization problems, where multiple objective functions shape a compositional landscape and hence challenge surrogate selection. SEEMOO comprises following core designs: 1) A pre-collected model pool that maintains different surrogate models; 2) An attention-based state-extractor supports universal optimization state representation of problems with varied objective numbers; 3) a deep Q-network serves as dynamic surrogate selector: Given the optimization state, it selects desired surrogate model for current-step evaluation. SEEMOO is trained to maximize the overall optimization performance under a training problem distribution. Extensive benchmark results demonstrate SEEMOO's surrogate ensemble paradigm boosts the optimization performance of single-surrogate baselines. Further ablation studies underscore the importance of SEEMOO's design components.",

        "abstract": "Network topology excels at structural predictions but fails to capture functional semantics encoded in biomedical literature. We present a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) embedding framework that integrates graph neural network representations with dynamically retrieved literature-derived knowledge through contrastive learning. Benchmarking against ten embedding methods reveals task-specific complementarity: topology-focused methods achieve near-perfect link prediction (GCN: 0.983 AUROC), while RAG-GNN is the only method achieving positive silhouette scores for functional clustering (0.001 vs. negative scores for all baselines). Information-theoretic decomposition shows network topology contributes 77.3% of predictive information, while retrieved documents provide 8.6% unique information. Applied to cancer signaling networks (379 proteins, 3,498 interactions), the framework identifies DDR1 as a therapeutic target based on retrieved evidence of synthetic lethality with KRAS mutations. These results establish that topology-only and retrieval-augmented approaches serve complementary purposes: structural prediction tasks are solved by network topology alone, while functional interpretation uniquely benefits from retrieved knowledge.",

To close this gap, we introduce Pix2Fact, a new visual question-answering benchmark designed to evaluate expert-level perception and knowledge-intensive multi-hop reasoning. Pix2Fact contains 1,000 high-resolution (4K+) images spanning 8 daily-life scenarios and situations, with questions and answers meticulously crafted by annotators holding PhDs from top global universities working in partnership with a professional data annotation firm. Each question requires detailed visual grounding, multi-hop reasoning, and the integration of external knowledge to answer. Our evaluation of 9 state-of-the-art VLMs, including proprietary models like Gemini-3-Pro and GPT-5, reveals the substantial challenge posed by Pix2Fact: the most advanced model achieves only 24.0% average accuracy, in stark contrast to human performance of 56%. This significant gap underscores the limitations of current models in replicating human-level visual comprehension. We believe Pix2Fact will serve as a critical benchmark to drive the development of next-generation multimodal agents that combine fine-grained perception with robust, knowledge-based reasoning.",

We show that logit-arithmetic jailbreaking methods are a special case of this framework under cross-entropy loss, and derive a broader family of aggregation rules corresponding to other proper losses.

Inspired by the framework of diffusion models developed for generative modeling, we introduce a sampling algorithm based on the simulation of a non-equilibrium deterministic dynamics that transports an easy-to-sample noise distribution toward the target. At the marginal level, the induced density path follows a prescribed stochastic interpolant between the noise and target distributions, specifically constructed to respect the underlying Riemannian geometry. In contrast to related generative modeling approaches that rely on machine learning, our method is entirely training-free. It instead builds on iterative posterior sampling procedures using only standard Monte Carlo techniques, thereby extending recent diffusion-based sampling methodologies beyond the Euclidean setting. We complement our approach with a rigorous theoretical analysis and demonstrate its effectiveness on a range of multi-modal sampling problems, including high-dimensional and heavy-tailed examples.",

Recently, (positive) non-clashing teaching was thoroughly studied for balls in graphs, yielding numerous algorithmic and combinatorial results. In particular, Chalopin et al. [COLT 2024] and Ganian et al. [ICLR 2025] gave an almost complete picture of the complexity landscape of the positive variant, showing that it is tractable only for restricted graph classes due to the non-trivial nature of the problem and concept class. In this work, we consider (positive) non-clashing teaching for closed neighborhoods in graphs. This concept class is not only extensively studied in various related contexts, but it also exhibits broad generality, as any finite binary concept class can be equivalently represented by a set of closed neighborhoods in a graph. In comparison to the works on balls in graphs, we provide improved algorithmic results, notably including FPT algorithms for more general classes of parameters, and we complement these results by deriving stronger lower bounds.

We propose a simple and data-efficient approach that enables audio-to-image retrieval without any audio-image supervision. Our proposed method uses text as a semantic intermediary: we distill the text embedding space of a pretrained image-text model (BioCLIP-2), which encodes rich visual and taxonomic structure, into a pretrained audio-text model (BioLingual) by fine-tuning its audio encoder with a contrastive objective. This distillation transfers visually grounded semantics into the audio representation, inducing emergent alignment between audio and image embeddings without using images during training. We evaluate the resulting model on multiple bioacoustic benchmarks. The distilled audio encoder preserves audio discriminative power while substantially improving audio-text alignment on focal recordings and soundscape datasets. Most importantly, on the SSW60 benchmark, the proposed approach achieves strong audio-to-image retrieval performance exceeding baselines based on zero-shot model combinations or learned mappings between text embeddings, despite not training on paired audio-image data. These results demonstrate that indirect semantic transfer through text is sufficient to induce meaningful audio-image alignment, providing a practical solution for visually grounded species recognition in data-scarce bioacoustic settings.",

First, we design a physics-informed mask strategy to guide the diffusion generation process based on a local receptive field, effectively eliminating noise interference. Second, we impose a physics-informed constraint on the diffusion generation results following the kriging principle of geomagnetic maps, ensuring strict adherence to the laws of physics.

We formalize this phenomenon as generative distortion, defined as the mismatch between the CFG-induced sampling distribution and the true conditional distribution. Considering Gaussian mixtures and their exact scores, and leveraging tools from statistical physics, we characterize the onset of distortion in a high-dimensional regime as a function of the number of classes. Our analysis reveals that distortions emerge through a phase transition in the effective potential governing the guided dynamics. In particular, our dynamical mean-field analysis shows that distortion persists when the number of modes grows exponentially with dimension, but vanishes in the sub-exponential regime. Consistent with prior finite-dimensional results, we further demonstrate that vanilla CFG shifts the mean and shrinks the variance of the conditional distribution. We show that standard CFG schedules are fundamentally incapable of preventing variance shrinkage. Finally, we propose a theoretically motivated guidance schedule featuring a negative-guidance window, which mitigates loss of diversity while preserving class separability.",

A key challenge is the severe lack of training data, as many properties are too complicated to calculate with high-throughput first principles techniques. To address this, recent research has created experimental databases from information extracted from scientific literature. However, most existing experimental databases do not provide full atomic coordinate information, which prevents them from supporting advanced ML architectures such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). In this work, we propose to bridge this gap through an alignment process between experimental databases and Crystallographic Information Files (CIF) from the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD). Our approach enables the creation of a database that can fully leverage state-of-the-art model architectures for material property prediction. It also opens the door to utilizing transfer learning to improve prediction accuracy. To validate our approach, we align NEMAD with the ICSD and compare models trained on the resulting database to those trained on NEMAD originally. We demonstrate significant improvements in both Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Correct Classification Rate (CCR) in predicting the ordering temperatures and magnetic ground states of magnetic materials, respectively.",

In this work, we propose a unified agentic NetGPT framework for AI-native xG networks, wherein a NetGPT core can either perform autonomous reasoning or delegate sub-tasks to domain-specialized agents via agentic communication. The framework establishes clear modular responsibilities and interoperable workflows, enabling scalable, distributed intelligence across the network. To support continual refinement of collaborative reasoning strategies, the framework is further enhanced through Agentic reinforcement learning under partially observable conditions and stochastic external states. The training pipeline incorporates masked loss against external agent uncertainty, entropy-guided exploration, and multi-objective rewards that jointly capture task quality, coordination efficiency, and resource constraints. Through this process, NetGPT learns when and how to collaborate, effectively balancing internal reasoning with agent invocation. Overall, this work provides a foundational architecture and training methodology for self-evolving, AI-native xG networks capable of autonomous sensing, reasoning, and action in complex communication environments.",

The goal is to design algorithms that minimize the leader's regret with respect to always playing an optimal commitment computed with knowledge of the game. We consider, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, the most realistic case in which the leader does not know anything about the follower's types, i.e., the possible follower payoffs. This raises considerable additional challenges compared to the commonly studied case in which the payoffs of follower types are known. First, we prove a strong negative result: no-regret is unattainable under action feedback, i.e., when the leader only observes the follower's best response at the end of each round. Thus, we focus on the easier type feedback model, where the follower's type is also revealed. In such a setting, we propose a no-regret algorithm that achieves a regret of $\\widetilde{O}(\\sqrt{T})$, when ignoring the dependence on other parameters.",

First, we demonstrate that a rectified flow trained using independent coupling is zero everywhere at $t=0.5$ if and only if the source and target distributions are identical. We term this property the \\emph{zero-flow criterion}. Second, we show that this criterion can certify conditional independence, thereby extracting \\emph{sufficient information} from the data. Third, we translate this criterion into a tractable, simulation-free loss function that enables learning amortized Markov blankets in graphical models and latent representations in self-supervised learning tasks. Experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. The code reproducing our experiments can be found at: this https URL.",

We show that faithful spectral analysis of the true Hessian is tractable at frontier scale. Using shard-local finite-difference Hessian vector products compatible with Fully Sharded Data Parallelism, we perform stochastic Lanczos quadrature on open-source language models with up to 100B parameters, producing the first large-scale spectral density estimates beyond the sub-10B regime. We characterize the numerical behavior of this pipeline, including finite-difference bias, floating-point noise amplification, and their effect on Krylov stability in fp32 and bf16, and derive practical operating regimes that are validated empirically. We further provide end-to-end runtime and memory scaling laws, showing that full-operator spectral probing incurs only a modest constant-factor overhead over first-order training. Crucially, direct access to the Hessian reveals that widely used block-diagonal curvature approximations can fail catastrophically, exhibiting order-one relative error and poor directional alignment even in mid-scale LLMs. Together, our results demonstrate that foundation-model Hessian spectra are both computable and qualitatively misrepresented by prevailing approximations, opening the door to principled curvature-based analysis at scale.",

We show that this behaviour is not incidental, but arises from a fundamental geometric mechanism in input space. Using kernel ridge regression as an exact model of wide neural networks, we prove that clustered dirty label poisons induce a rank one spike in the input Hessian whose magnitude scales quadratically with attack efficacy. Crucially, for nonlinear kernels we identify a near clone regime in which poison efficacy remains order one while the induced input curvature vanishes, making the attack provably spectrally undetectable. We further show that input gradient regularisation contracts poison aligned Fisher and Hessian eigenmodes under gradient flow, yielding an explicit and unavoidable safety efficacy trade off by reducing data fitting capacity. For exponential kernels, this defence admits a precise interpretation as an anisotropic high pass filter that increases the effective length scale and suppresses near clone poisons. Extensive experiments on linear models and deep convolutional networks across MNIST and CIFAR 10 and CIFAR 100 validate the theory, demonstrating consistent lags between attack success and spectral visibility, and showing that regularisation and data augmentation jointly suppress poisoning. Our results establish when backdoors are inherently invisible, and provide the first end to end characterisation of poisoning, detectability, and defence through input space curvature.",

Consequently, existing fractional Langevin methods operate in an unadjusted regime and can exhibit substantial finite-time errors and poor empirical control of tail behavior. We introduce the Metropolis-Adjusted Fractional Langevin Algorithm (MAFLA), an MH-inspired, fully score-based correction mechanism. MAFLA employs designed proxies for fractional proposal score gradients under isotropic symmetric $\\alpha$-stable noise and learns an acceptance function via Score Balance Matching.

Building on this formulation, we propose RoDiF (Robust Direct Fine-Tuning), a method that explicitly addresses corrupted human preferences. RoDiF reinterprets the DPO objective through a geometric hypothesis-cutting perspective and employs a conservative cutting strategy to achieve robustness without assuming any specific noise distribution.

We introduce effGen, an open-source agentic framework optimized for small language models (SLMs) that enables effective, efficient, and secure local deployment (pip install effgen). effGen makes four major contributions: (1) Enhanced tool-calling with prompt optimization that compresses contexts by 70-80% while preserving task semantics, (2) Intelligent task decomposition that breaks complex queries into parallel or sequential subtasks based on dependencies, (3) Complexity-based routing using five factors to make smart pre-execution decisions, and (4) Unified memory system combining short-term, long-term, and vector-based storage. Additionally, effGen unifies multiple agent protocols (MCP, A2A, ACP) for cross-protocol communication. Results on 13 benchmarks show effGen outperforms LangChain, AutoGen, and Smolagents with higher success rates, faster execution, and lower memory. Our results reveal that prompt optimization and complexity routing have complementary scaling behavior: optimization benefits SLMs more (11.2% gain at 1.5B vs 2.4% at 32B), while routing benefits large models more (3.6% at 1.5B vs 7.9% at 32B), providing consistent gains across all scales when combined. effGen (this https URL) is released under the MIT License, ensuring broad accessibility for research and commercial use.

First, the contaminated MoE model has been studied solely in regression settings, while its theoretical foundation in classification settings remains absent. Second, previous works on MoE models for classification capture pointwise convergence rates for parameter estimation without any guaranty of minimax optimality. In this work, we close these gaps by performing, for the first time, the convergence analysis of a contaminated mixture of multinomial logistic experts with homogeneous and heterogeneous structures, respectively. In each regime, we characterize uniform convergence rates for estimating parameters under challenging settings where ground-truth parameters vary with the sample size. Furthermore, we also establish corresponding minimax lower bounds to ensure that these rates are minimax optimal. Notably, our theories offer an important insight into the design of contaminated MoE, that is, expert heterogeneity yields faster parameter estimation rates and, therefore, is more sample-efficient than expert homogeneity.",

By combining spectral, local-variation, and global shape descriptors, our method captures internal stability patterns that are missed by probabilities and sentence embeddings. We conduct extensive, cross-domain evaluation across four heterogeneous benchmarks-FEVER (fact verification), SciFact (scientific claims), WikiBio-hallucination (biographical consistency), and TruthfulQA (truthfulness-oriented QA). Our Structural Confidence framework demonstrates strong performance compared with established baselines in terms of AUROC and AUPR. More importantly, unlike sampling-based consistency methods which require multiple stochastic generations and an auxiliary model, our approach uses a single deterministic forward pass, offering a practical basis for efficient, robust post-hoc confidence estimation in socially impactful, resource-constrained LLM applications.",

        "abstract": "Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards has emerged as a promising paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models particularly in mathematics. Current approaches in this domain present a clear trade-off: PPO-style methods (e.g., GRPO/DAPO) offer training stability but exhibit slow learning trajectories due to their trust-region constraints on policy updates, while REINFORCE-style approaches (e.g., CISPO) demonstrate improved learning efficiency but suffer from performance instability as they clip importance sampling weights while still permitting non-zero gradients outside the trust-region. To address these limitations, we introduce DISPO, a simple yet effective REINFORCE-style algorithm that decouples the up-clipping and down-clipping of importance sampling weights for correct and incorrect responses, yielding four controllable policy update regimes. Through targeted ablations, we uncover how each regime impacts training: for correct responses, weights >1 increase the average token entropy (i.e., exploration) while weights <1 decrease it (i.e., distillation) -- both beneficial but causing gradual performance degradation when excessive. For incorrect responses, overly restrictive clipping triggers sudden performance collapse through repetitive outputs (when weights >1) or vanishing response lengths (when weights <1). By separately tuning these four clipping parameters, DISPO maintains the exploration-distillation balance while preventing catastrophic failures, achieving 61.04% on AIME'24 (vs. 55.42% CISPO and 50.21% DAPO) with similar gains across various benchmarks and models.",

Yet, it remains unclear how to use them optimally for downstream decision-making. Here, we propose a decision-theoretic framework that seeks to minimize the expected loss (risk) against a worst-case distribution consistent with the prediction set's coverage guarantee. We first characterize the minimax optimal policy for a fixed prediction set, showing that it balances the worst-case loss inside the set with a penalty for potential losses outside the set. Building on this, we derive the optimal prediction set construction that minimizes the resulting robust risk subject to a coverage constraint. Finally, we introduce Risk-Optimal Conformal Prediction (ROCP), a practical algorithm that targets these risk-minimizing sets while maintaining finite-sample distribution-free marginal coverage. Empirical evaluations on medical diagnosis and safety-critical decision-making tasks demonstrate that ROCP reduces critical mistakes compared to baselines, particularly when out-of-set errors are costly.",

However, the low resolution and speckle noise inherent to ultrasound images hinder diagnostic reliability, prompting the use of large convolutional neural networks that are difficult to deploy in routine clinical settings. In this work, we propose CortiNet, a lightweight, cortical-inspired dual-stream neural architecture for gallbladder disease diagnosis that integrates physically interpretable multi-scale signal decomposition with perception-driven feature learning. Inspired by parallel processing pathways in the human visual cortex, CortiNet explicitly separates low-frequency structural information from high-frequency perceptual details and processes them through specialized encoding streams. By operating directly on structured, frequency-selective representations rather than raw pixel intensities, the architecture embeds strong physics-based inductive bias, enabling efficient feature learning with a significantly reduced parameter footprint. A late-stage cortical-style fusion mechanism integrates complementary structural and textural cues while preserving computational efficiency. Additionally, we propose a structure-aware explainability framework wherein gradient-weighted class activation mapping is only applied to the structural branch of the proposed CortiNet architecture. This choice allows the model to only focus on the structural features, making it robust against speckle noise. We evaluate CortiNet on 10,692 expert-annotated images spanning nine clinically relevant gallbladder disease categories. Experimental results demonstrate that CortiNet achieves high diagnostic accuracy (98.74%) with only a fraction of the parameters required by conventional deep convolutional models.",

Rather than viewing evolution solely as gradual changes driven by mutation and selection, this hypothesis suggests that self-replication inherently compresses and reconstructs genetic information across hierarchical layers of abstraction. This layered structure enables evolutionary systems to explore diverse possibilities not only at the sequence level but also across progressively more abstract layers of representation, making it possible for even simple mutations to navigate these higher-order this http URL a mechanism may explain punctuated evolutionary patterns and changes that can appear as if they are goal-directed in natural evolution, by allowing mutations at deeper latent layers to trigger sudden, large-scale phenotypic shifts. To illustrate the plausibility of this mechanism, artificial chemistry simulations were conducted, demonstrating the spontaneous emergence of hierarchical autoencoder structures. This framework offers a new perspective on the informational dynamics underlying both continuous and discontinuous evolutionary change.",

Developers may need to replace one library with another due to reasons like changing requirements or licensing changes. Migration typically entails updating and rewriting source code manually. While automated migration tools exist, most rely on mining examples from real-world projects that have already undergone similar migrations. However, these data are scarce, and collecting them for arbitrary pairs of libraries is difficult. Moreover, these migration tools often miss out on leveraging modern code transformation infrastructure. In this paper, we present a new approach to automated API migration that sidesteps the limitations described above. Instead of relying on existing migration data or using LLMs directly for transformation, we use LLMs to extract migration examples. Next, we use an Agent to generalize those examples to reusable transformation scripts in PolyglotPiranha, a modern code transformation tool. Our method distills latent migration knowledge from LLMs into structured, testable, and repeatable migration logic, without requiring preexisting corpora or manual engineering effort. Experimental results across Python libraries show that our system can generate diverse migration examples and synthesize transformation scripts that generalize to real-world codebases.",

In this paper, we propose a novel framework that extends LLM-based TPPs to the visual modality, positioning text generation as a core capability alongside time and type prediction. Our approach addresses the long-context problem through an adaptive sequence compression mechanism based on temporal similarity, which reduces sequence length while preserving essential patterns. We employ a two-stage paradigm of pre-training on compressed sequences followed by supervised fine-tuning for downstream tasks.

However, ML models often suffer from poor experimental generalizability despite high metrics. This study presents a robust workflow, applied to the half-Heusler (hH) structural prototype, for figure of merit (zT) prediction, to improve the generalizability of ML models. To resolve challenges in dataset handling and feature filtering, we first introduce a rigorous PCA-based splitting method that ensures training and test sets are unbiased and representative of the full chemical space. We then integrate Bayesian hyperparameter optimization with k-best feature filtering across three architectures-Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks - while employing SISSO symbolic regression for physical insight and comparison. Using SHAP and SISSO analysis, we identify A-site dopant concentration (xA'), and A-site Heat of Vaporization (HVA) as the primary drivers of zT besides Temperature (T). Finally, a high-throughput screening of approximately 6.6x10^8 potential compositions, filtered by stability constraints, yielded several novel high-zT candidates. Breaking from the traditional focus of improving test RMSE/R^2 values of the models, this work shifts the attention on establishing the test set a true proxy for model generalizability and strengthening the often neglected modules of the existing ML workflows for the data-driven design of next-generation thermoelectric materials.",

In traditional FL, local models are trained on edge devices, and only model updates are shared with a central server, which aggregates them to improve the global model.

        "abstract": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is widely used to ground Large Language Models (LLMs) for multi-hop question answering. Recent work mainly focused on improving answer accuracy via fine-tuning and structured or reinforcement-based optimization. However, reliable reasoning in response generation faces three challenges: 1) Reasoning Collapse. Reasoning in multi-hop QA is inherently complex due to multi-hop composition and is further destabilized by noisy retrieval. 2) Reasoning-answer inconsistency. Due to the intrinsic uncertainty of LLM generation and exposure to evidence--distractor mixtures, models may produce correct answers that are not faithfully supported by their intermediate reasoning or evidence. 3) Loss of format control. Traditional chain-of-thought generation often deviates from required structured output formats, leading to incomplete or malformed structured content. To address these challenges, we propose CRAFT (Calibrated Reasoning with Answer-Faithful Traces), a Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) based reinforcement learning framework that trains models to perform faithful reasoning during response generation. CRAFT employs dual reward mechanisms to optimize multi-hop reasoning: deterministic rewards ensure structural correctness while judge-based rewards verify semantic faithfulness. This optimization framework supports controllable trace variants that enable systematic analysis of how structure and scale affect reasoning performance and faithfulness. Experiments on three multi-hop QA benchmarks show that CRAFT improves both answer accuracy and reasoning faithfulness across model scales, with the CRAFT 7B model achieving competitive performance with closed-source LLMs across multiple reasoning trace settings.",

        "abstract": "Entropic regularization provides a simple way to approximate linear programs whose constraints split into two (or more) tractable blocks. The resulting objectives are amenable to cyclic Kullback-Leibler (KL) Bregman projections, with the classical Sinkhorn algorithm for optimal transport (balanced, unbalanced, gradient flows, barycenters, \\dots) as the canonical example. Assuming uniformly bounded primal mass and dual radius, we prove that the dual objective of these KL projections decreases at an $O(1/k)$ rate with a constant that scales only linearly in $1/\\gamma$, where $\\gamma$ is the entropic regularization parameter. This extends the guarantees known for entropic optimal transport to any such linearly constrained problem. Following the terminology introduced in [Chizat et al 2025], we call such rates \"robust\", because this mild dependence on $\\gamma$ underpins favorable complexity bounds for approximating the unregularized problem via alternating KL projections. The crucial aspect of the analysis is that the dual radius should be measured according to a block-quotient dual seminorm, which depends on the structure of the split of the constraint into blocks. As an application, we derive the flow-Sinkhorn algorithm for the Wasserstein-1 distance on graphs. It achieves $\\epsilon$-additive accuracy on the transshipment cost in $O(p/\\epsilon^{4})$ arithmetic operations, where $p$ is the number of edges.",

        "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) offers transformative potential for computational fluid dynamics (CFD), promising to accelerate simulations, improve turbulence modelling, and enable real-time flow prediction and control-capabilities that could fundamentally change how engineers approach fluid dynamics problems. However, the exploration of ML in fluid dynamics is critically hampered by the scarcity of large, diverse, and high-fidelity datasets suitable for training robust models. This limitation is particularly acute for highly turbulent flows, which dominate practical engineering applications yet remain computationally prohibitive to simulate at scale. High-Reynolds number turbulent datasets are essential for ML models to learn the complex, multi-scale physics characteristic of real-world flows, enabling generalisation beyond the simplified, low-Reynolds number regimes often represented in existing datasets. This paper introduces WAKESET, a novel, large-scale CFD dataset of highly turbulent flows, designed to address this critical gap. The dataset captures the complex hydrodynamic interactions during the underwater recovery of an autonomous underwater vehicle by a larger extra-large uncrewed underwater vehicle. It comprises 1,091 high-fidelity Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes simulations, augmented to 4,364 instances, covering a wide operational envelope of speeds (up to Reynolds numbers of 1.09 x 10^8) and turning angles. This work details the motivation for this new dataset by reviewing existing resources, outlines the hydrodynamic modelling and validation underpinning its creation, and describes its structure. The dataset's focus on a practical engineering problem, its scale, and its high turbulence characteristics make it a valuable resource for developing and benchmarking ML models for flow field prediction, surrogate modelling, and autonomous navigation in complex underwater environments.",

In finance, DRL is commonly used either to generate discrete trade signals or to determine continuous portfolio allocations. In this work, we propose a novel reinforcement learning framework for portfolio optimization that incorporates Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (PIKANs) into several DRL algorithms. The approach replaces conventional multilayer perceptrons with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) in both actor and critic components-utilizing learnable B-spline univariate functions to achieve parameter-efficient and more interpretable function approximation. During actor updates, we introduce a physics-informed regularization loss that promotes second-order temporal consistency between observed return dynamics and the action-induced portfolio adjustments. The proposed framework is evaluated across three equity markets-China, Vietnam, and the United States, covering both emerging and developed economies. Across all three markets, PIKAN-based agents consistently deliver higher cumulative and annualized returns, superior Sharpe and Calmar ratios, and more favorable drawdown characteristics compared to both standard DRL baselines and classical online portfolio-selection methods. This yields more stable training, higher Sharpe ratios, and superior performance compared to traditional DRL counterparts. The approach is particularly valuable in highly dynamic and noisy financial markets, where conventional DRL often suffers from instability and poor generalization.",

Individuals who receive a resource derive some stochastic utility; to characterize the population-level effects of an allocation, the expected individual utilities are then aggregated using a social welfare function (SWF). We formalize this setting and present a general confidence sequence framework for SWF-based online learning and inference, valid for any monotonic, concave, and Lipschitz-continuous SWF. Our key insight is that monotonicity alone suffices to lift confidence sequences from individual utilities to anytime-valid bounds on optimal welfare. Building on this foundation, we propose SWF-UCB, a SWF-agnostic online learning algorithm that achieves near-optimal $\\tilde{O}(n+\\sqrt{nkT})$ regret (for $k$ resources distributed among $n$ individuals at each of $T$ time steps). We instantiate our framework on three normatively distinct SWF families: Weighted Power Mean, Kolm, and Gini, providing bespoke oracle algorithms for each. Experiments confirm $\\sqrt{T}$ scaling and reveal rich interactions between $k$ and SWF parameters. This framework naturally supports inference applications such as sequential hypothesis testing, optimal stopping, and policy evaluation.",

Standard optimization relies on reparameterized gradient estimators, which are well-studied theoretically yet restrict both the choice of the data-generating process and the variational approximation. While REINFORCE gradient estimators do not suffer from such restrictions, they lack rigorous theoretical justification. In this paper, we provide the first comprehensive analysis of REINFORCE gradient estimators in importance weighted VI, leveraging this theoretical foundation to diagnose and resolve fundamental deficiencies in current state-of-the-art estimators. Specifically, we introduce and examine a generalized family of variational inference for Monte Carlo objectives (VIMCO) gradient estimators. We prove that state-of-the-art VIMCO gradient estimators exhibit a vanishing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as $N$ increases, which prevents effective optimization. To overcome this issue, we propose the novel VIMCO-$\\star$ gradient estimator and show that it averts the SNR collapse of existing VIMCO gradient estimators by achieving a $\\sqrt{N}$ SNR scaling instead. We demonstrate its superior empirical performance compared to current VIMCO implementations in challenging settings where reparameterized gradients are typically unavailable.",

In this paper, we identify the importance of the instruction pair used during training. Furthermore, we show that targeting specific deceptive behaviors through a human-interpretable taxonomy of deception leads to improved results on evaluation datasets. Our findings reveal that instruction pairs capture deceptive intent rather than content-specific patterns, explaining why prompt choice dominates probe performance (70.6% of variance). Given the heterogeneity of deception types across datasets, we conclude that organizations should design specialized probes targeting their specific threat models rather than seeking a universal deception detector.",

We study this phenomenon through the noise-to-signal ratio (NSR) of a policy-gradient estimator, defined as the estimator variance (noise) normalized by the squared norm of the true gradient (signal). Our main result is that, for (i) finite-horizon linear systems with Gaussian policies and linear state-feedback, and (ii) finite-horizon polynomial systems with Gaussian policies and polynomial feedback, the NSR of the REINFORCE estimator can be characterized exactly-either in closed form or via numerical moment-evaluation algorithms-without approximation. For general nonlinear dynamics and expressive policies (including neural policies), we further derive a general upper bound on the variance. These characterizations enable a direct examination of how NSR varies across policy parameters and how it evolves along optimization trajectories (e.g. SGD and Adam). Across a range of examples, we find that the NSR landscape is highly non-uniform and typically increases as the policy approaches an optimum; in some regimes it blows up, which can trigger training instability and policy collapse.",

Nevertheless, there are three notable concerns that have not been addressed in the literature, namely (i) the benefits of the sigmoid gate have not been established under classification settings; (ii) existing sigmoid-gated MoE models may not converge to their ground-truth; and (iii) the effects of a temperature parameter in the sigmoid gate remain theoretically underexplored. To tackle these open problems, we perform a comprehensive analysis of multinomial logistic MoE equipped with a modified sigmoid gate to ensure model convergence. Our results indicate that the sigmoid gate exhibits a lower sample complexity than the softmax gate for both parameter and expert estimation. Furthermore, we find that incorporating a temperature into the sigmoid gate leads to a sample complexity of exponential order due to an intrinsic interaction between the temperature and gating parameters. To overcome this issue, we propose replacing the vanilla inner product score in the gating function with a Euclidean score that effectively removes that interaction, thereby substantially improving the sample complexity to a polynomial order.",

Despite its popularity, its theoretical foundations and behavior under distributional shift remain poorly understood. In this work, we provide a principled statistical interpretation by proving that EDL training corresponds to amortized variational inference in a hierarchical Bayesian model with a tempered pseudo-likelihood. This perspective reveals a major drawback: standard EDL conflates epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty, leading to systematic overconfidence on out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. To address this, we introduce Density-Informed Pseudo-count EDL (DIP-EDL), a new parametrization that decouples class prediction from the magnitude of uncertainty by separately estimating the conditional label distribution and the marginal covariate density. This separation preserves evidence in high-density regions while shrinking predictions toward a uniform prior for OOD data. Theoretically, we prove that DIP-EDL achieves asymptotic concentration. Empirically, we show that our method enhances interpretability and improves robustness and uncertainty calibration under distributional shift.",

We introduce an alternating optimization strategy to mitigate the non-stationarity of simultaneous updates, providing theoretical analysis that demonstrates how this schedule reduces gradient variance during training. Extensive experiments show that Rubric-ARM achieves state-of-the-art performance among baselines on multiple benchmarks and significantly improves downstream policy alignment in both offline and online reinforcement learning settings.",

        "abstract": "Deploying learned control policies on humanoid robots is challenging: policies that appear robust in simulation can execute confidently in out-of-distribution (OOD) states after Sim-to-Real transfer, leading to silent failures that risk hardware damage. Although anomaly detection can mitigate these failures, prior methods are often incompatible with high-rate control, poorly calibrated at the extremely low false-positive rates required for practical deployment, or operate as black boxes that provide a binary stop signal without explaining why the robot drifted from nominal behavior. We present RAPT, a lightweight, self-supervised deployment-time monitor for 50Hz humanoid control. RAPT learns a probabilistic spatio-temporal manifold of nominal execution from simulation and evaluates execution-time predictive deviation as a calibrated, per-dimension signal. This yields (i) reliable online OOD detection under strict false-positive constraints and (ii) a continuous, interpretable measure of Sim-to-Real mismatch that can be tracked over time to quantify how far deployment has drifted from training. Beyond detection, we introduce an automated post-hoc root-cause analysis pipeline that combines gradient-based temporal saliency derived from RAPT's reconstruction objective with LLM-based reasoning conditioned on saliency and joint kinematics to produce semantic failure diagnoses in a zero-shot setting. We evaluate RAPT on a Unitree G1 humanoid across four complex tasks in simulation and on physical hardware. In large-scale simulation, RAPT improves True Positive Rate (TPR) by 37% over the strongest baseline at a fixed episode-level false positive rate of 0.5%. On real-world deployments, RAPT achieves a 12.5% TPR improvement and provides actionable interpretability, reaching 75% root-cause classification accuracy across 16 real-world failures using only proprioceptive data.",

Existing mitigations via prompting or supervised fine-tuning fail to generalize, as they modify surface behavior without changing the optimization objective that makes bias cues predictive. To address this gap, we propose Epistemic Independence Training (EIT), a reinforcement learning framework grounded in a key principle: to learn independence, bias cues must be made non-predictive of reward. EIT operationalizes this through a balanced conflict strategy where bias signals are equally likely to support correct and incorrect answers, combined with a reward design that penalizes bias-following without rewarding bias agreement. Experiments on Qwen3-4B demonstrate that EIT improves both accuracy and robustness under adversarial biases, while preserving performance when bias aligns with truth. Notably, models trained only on bandwagon bias generalize to unseen bias types such as authority and distraction, indicating that EIT induces transferable epistemic independence rather than bias-specific heuristics.

For a genus-0 closed surface, many efficient algorithms can map the surface to the sphere; consequently, a broad class of task-driven genus-0 mapping problems can be reduced to constructing a high-quality spherical self-map. However, existing approaches often face a trade-off between satisfying task objectives (e.g., landmark or feature alignment), maintaining bijectivity, and controlling geometric distortion. We introduce the Spherical Beltrami Differential (SBD), a two-chart representation of quasiconformal self-maps of the sphere, and establish its correspondence with spherical homeomorphisms up to conformal automorphisms. Building on the Spectral Beltrami Network (SBN), we propose a neural optimization framework BOOST that optimizes two Beltrami fields on hemispherical stereographic charts and enforces global consistency through explicit seam-aware constraints. Experiments on large-deformation landmark matching and intensity-based spherical registration demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework. We further apply the method to brain cortical surface registration, aligning sulcal landmarks and jointly matching cortical sulci depth maps, showing improved task fidelity with controlled distortion and robust bijective behavior.",

We argue that this formulation requires re-examination as it assumes uniform risk across all malicious queries, neglecting Execution Likelihood--the conditional probability of a threat being realized given the model's response. In this work, we introduce Expected Harm, a metric that weights the severity of a jailbreak by its execution likelihood, modeled as a function of execution cost. Through empirical analysis of state-of-the-art models, we reveal a systematic Inverse Risk Calibration: models disproportionately exhibit stronger refusal behaviors for low-likelihood (high-cost) threats while remaining vulnerable to high-likelihood (low-cost) queries. We demonstrate that this miscalibration creates a structural vulnerability: by exploiting this property, we increase the attack success rate of existing jailbreaks by up to $2\\times$. Finally, we trace the root cause of this failure using linear probing, which reveals that while models encode severity in their latent space to drive refusal decisions, they possess no distinguishable internal representation of execution cost, making them \"blind\" to this critical dimension of risk.",

A central challenge is to achieve strong utility guarantees for meaningful downstream analysis. Many existing methods ensure uniform accuracy over broad query classes, such as all Lipschitz functions, but this level of generality often leads to suboptimal rates for statistics of practical interest. Since many common data analysis queries exhibit smoothness beyond what worst-case Lipschitz bounds capture, we ask whether exploiting this additional structure can yield improved utility. We study the problem of generating $(\\varepsilon,\\delta)$-differentially private synthetic data from a dataset of size $n$ supported on the hypercube $[-1,1]^d$, with utility guarantees uniformly for all smooth queries having bounded derivatives up to order $k$. We propose a polynomial-time algorithm that achieves a minimax error rate of $n^{-\\min \\{1, \\frac{k}{d}\\}}$, up to a $\\log(n)$ factor. This characterization uncovers a phase transition at $k=d$. Our results generalize the Chebyshev moment matching framework of (Musco et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2016) and strictly improve the error rates for $k$-smooth queries established in (Wang et al., 2016). Moreover, we establish the first minimax lower bound for the utility of $(\\varepsilon,\\delta)$-differentially private synthetic data with respect to $k$-smooth queries, extending the Wasserstein lower bound for $\\varepsilon$-differential privacy in (Boedihardjo et al., 2024).",

In this paper, we propose MGF-softmax, a novel softmax reformulation based on the moment generating function (MGF) that replaces the softmax denominator with its moment-based counterpart. This reformulation substantially reduces multiplicative depth while preserving key properties of softmax and asymptotically converging to the exact softmax as the number of input tokens increases. Extensive experiments on Vision Transformers and large language models show that MGF-softmax provides an efficient and accurate approximation of softmax in encrypted inference. In particular, it achieves inference accuracy close to that of high-depth exact methods, while requiring substantially lower computational cost through reduced multiplicative depth.",

A custom dataset comprising 31 surgical instruments and 6,975 annotated images was collected to train a hybrid perception pipeline using YOLO12 for detection and a cascaded ResNet-based model for fine-grained classification.

The packing framework uses 3D printed dividers and holders to physically isolate instruments, reducing collision and friction during transport. Experimental evaluations show high perception accuracy and statistically significant reduction in tool-to-tool collisions compared to human-assembled trays.

We reconcile this tension by proposing LSTR (Latent Sparse Transcoder Reasoning), a latent reasoning framework that elevates functional sparse transcoders into active reasoning operators to perform multi-step computation through sparse semantic transitions. At its core, LSTR employs a Latent Transition Transcoder (LTT) with a residual skip architecture that decouples linear manifold transport from sparse semantic updates, enabling controllable semantic resolution via explicit sparsity constraints. Extensive experiments show that LSTR preserves reasoning accuracy and compression efficiency while substantially improving interpretability over dense latent baselines. Causal interventions and trajectory analyses further demonstrate that these sparse features act as both interpretable and causally effective operators in the reasoning process.",

However, we show that modern reasoning post-training induces an unintended exploration collapse: temperature-based sampling no longer increases pass@$n$ accuracy. Empirically, the final-layer posterior of post-trained LRMs exhibit sharply reduced entropy, while the entropy of intermediate layers remains relatively high. Motivated by this entropy asymmetry, we propose Latent Exploration Decoding (LED), a depth-conditioned decoding strategy. LED aggregates intermediate posteriors via cumulative sum and selects depth configurations with maximal entropy as exploration candidates. Without additional training or parameters, LED consistently improves pass@1 and pass@16 accuracy by 0.61 and 1.03 percentage points across multiple reasoning benchmarks and models.

        "abstract": "With the widespread deployment of Computer-using Agents (CUAs) in complex real-world environments, prevalent long-term risks often lead to severe and irreversible consequences. Most existing guardrails for CUAs adopt a reactive approach, constraining agent behavior only within the current observation space. While these guardrails can prevent immediate short-term risks (e.g., clicking on a phishing link), they cannot proactively avoid long-term risks: seemingly reasonable actions can lead to high-risk consequences that emerge with a delay (e.g., cleaning logs leads to future audits being untraceable), which reactive guardrails cannot identify within the current observation space. To address these limitations, we propose a predictive guardrail approach, with the core idea of aligning predicted future risks with current decisions. Based on this approach, we present SafePred, a predictive guardrail framework for CUAs that establishes a risk-to-decision loop to ensure safe agent behavior. SafePred supports two key abilities: (1) Short- and long-term risk prediction: by using safety policies as the basis for risk prediction, SafePred leverages the prediction capability of the world model to generate semantic representations of both short-term and long-term risks, thereby identifying and pruning actions that lead to high-risk states; (2) Decision optimization: translating predicted risks into actionable safe decision guidances through step-level interventions and task-level re-planning. Extensive experiments show that SafePred significantly reduces high-risk behaviors, achieving over 97.6% safety performance and improving task utility by up to 21.4% compared with reactive baselines.",

        "abstract": "Cross-domain fake news detection (CD-FND) transfers knowledge from a source domain to a target domain and is crucial for real-world fake news mitigation. This task becomes particularly important yet more challenging when the target domain is previously unseen (e.g., the COVID-19 outbreak or the Russia-Ukraine war). However, existing CD-FND methods overlook such scenarios and consequently suffer from the following two key limitations: (1) insufficient modeling of high-level semantics in news and user engagements; and (2) scarcity of labeled data in unseen domains. Targeting these limitations, we find that large language models (LLMs) offer strong potential for CD-FND on unseen domains, yet their effective use remains non-trivial. Nevertheless, two key challenges arise: (1) how to capture high-level semantics from both news content and user engagements using LLMs; and (2) how to make LLM-generated features more reliable and transferable for CD-FND on unseen domains. To tackle these challenges, we propose DAUD, a novel LLM-Based Domain-Aware framework for fake news detection on Unseen Domains. DAUD employs LLMs to extract high-level semantics from news content. It models users' single- and cross-domain engagements to generate domain-aware behavioral representations. In addition, DAUD captures the relations between original data-driven features and LLM-derived features of news, users, and user engagements. This allows it to extract more reliable domain-shared representations that improve knowledge transfer to unseen domains. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that DAUD outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both general and unseen-domain CD-FND settings.",

In this work, we introduce ST-BCP, a novel method that introduces a data-dependent transformation of nonconformity scores to narrow the coverage gap.

To overcome the architectural limitations, we introduce the Physics-Informed Chebyshev Polynomial Neural Operator (CPNO), a novel mesh-free framework that leverages a basis transformation to replace unstable monomial expansions with the numerically stable Chebyshev spectral basis. By integrating parameter dependent modulation mechanism to main net, CPNO constructs PDE solutions in a near-optimal functional space, decoupling the model from MLP-specific constraints and enhancing multi-scale representation. Theoretical analysis demonstrates the Chebyshev basis's near-minimax uniform approximation properties and superior conditioning, with Lebesgue constants growing logarithmically with degree, thereby mitigating spectral bias and ensuring stable gradient flow during optimization. Numerical experiments on benchmark parameterized PDEs show that CPNO achieves superior accuracy, faster convergence, and enhanced robustness to hyperparameters.

However, in real-world settings, the extreme scarcity of labeled data severely limits the development and practical adoption of robust AES systems. This study proposes a novel approach to enhance AES performance in both limited-data and full-data settings by introducing three key techniques. First, we introduce a Two-Stage fine-tuning strategy that leverages low-rank adaptations to better adapt an AES model to target prompt essays. Second, we introduce a Score Alignment technique to improve consistency between predicted and true score distributions. Third, we employ uncertainty-aware self-training using unlabeled data, effectively expanding the training set with pseudo-labeled samples while mitigating label noise propagation. We implement above three key techniques on DualBERT. We conduct extensive experiments on the ASAP++ dataset. As a result, in the 32-data setting, all three key techniques improve performance, and their integration achieves 91.2% of the full-data performance trained on approximately 1,000 labeled samples. In addition, the proposed Score Alignment technique consistently improves performance in both limited-data and full-data settings: e.g., it achieves state-of-the-art results in the full-data setting when integrated into DualBERT.",

These constraints render them ineffective in strict black-box and cross-domain settings. To dismantle these barriers, we introduce Zero2Text, a novel training-free framework based on recursive online alignment. Unlike methods relying on static datasets, Zero2Text synergizes LLM priors with a dynamic ridge regression mechanism to iteratively align generation to the target embedding on-the-fly. We further demonstrate that standard defenses, such as differential privacy, fail to effectively mitigate this adaptive threat. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks validate Zero2Text; notably, on MS MARCO against the OpenAI victim model, it achieves 1.8x higher ROUGE-L and 6.4x higher BLEU-2 scores compared to baselines, recovering sentences from unknown domains without a single leaked data pair.",

However, this is hard to decide, because costs can vary drastically: a simple parameter tweak may take seconds, while fabricating hardware consumes material and energy. Such asymmetries, can discourage a designer from exploring the design space. In this paper, we present an extension of cost-aware Bayesian optimization to account for diverse prototyping costs. The method builds on the power of Bayesian optimization and requires only a minimal modification to the acquisition function. The key idea is to use designer-estimated costs to guide sampling toward more cost-effective prototypes. In technical evaluations, the method achieved comparable utility to a cost-agnostic baseline while requiring only ${\\approx}70\\%$ of the cost; under strict budgets, it outperformed the baseline threefold. A within-subjects study with 12 participants in a realistic joystick design task demonstrated similar benefits. These results show that accounting for prototyping costs can make Bayesian optimization more compatible with real-world design projects.",

Current defenses typically face a critical trade-off: prevention-based fine-tuning often degrades general utility via the \"alignment tax\", while detection-based filtering incurs prohibitive latency and memory costs. To bridge this gap, we propose RedVisor, a unified framework that synthesizes the explainability of detection systems with the seamless integration of prevention strategies. To the best of our knowledge, RedVisor is the first approach to leverage fine-grained reasoning paths to simultaneously detect attacks and guide the model's safe response. We implement this via a lightweight, removable adapter positioned atop the frozen backbone. This adapter serves a dual function: it first generates an explainable analysis that precisely localizes the injection and articulates the threat, which then explicitly conditions the model to reject the malicious command. Uniquely, the adapter is active only during this reasoning phase and is effectively muted during the subsequent response generation. This architecture yields two distinct advantages: (1) it mathematically preserves the backbone's original utility on benign inputs; and (2) it enables a novel KV Cache Reuse strategy, eliminating the redundant prefill computation inherent to decoupled pipelines. We further pioneer the integration of this defense into the vLLM serving engine with custom kernels. Experiments demonstrate that RedVisor outperforms state-of-the-art defenses in detection accuracy and throughput while incurring negligible utility loss.",

Both paradigms rely on word embeddings not only to represent the input sentence, but also to represent the target sentence that backbone models are trained to predict. We argue that such static embedding of the target word is insensitive to neighboring words, encouraging locally accurate word prediction while neglecting global structure across the target sentence. To address this limitation, we propose a continuous sentence representation, termed sentence curve, defined as a spline curve whose control points affect multiple words in the sentence. Based on this representation, we introduce sentence curve language model (SCLM), which extends DLMs to predict sentence curves instead of the static word embeddings. We theoretically show that sentence curve prediction induces a regularization effect that promotes global structure modeling, and characterize how different sentence curve types affect this behavior. Empirically, SCLM achieves SOTA performance among DLMs on IWSLT14 and WMT14, shows stable training without burdensome knowledge distillation, and demonstrates promising potential compared to discrete DLMs on LM1B.",

This paper aims to learn robust sequential decision-making policies from such offline, multi-site datasets. To model cross-site uncertainty, we study distributionally robust MDPs with a group-linear structure: all sites share a common feature map, and both the transition kernels and expected reward functions are linear in these shared features. We introduce feature-wise (d-rectangular) uncertainty sets, which preserve tractable robust Bellman recursions while maintaining key cross-site structure. Building on this, we then develop an offline algorithm based on pessimistic value iteration that includes: (i) per-site ridge regression for Bellman targets, (ii) feature-wise worst-case (row-wise minimization) aggregation, and (iii) a data-dependent pessimism penalty computed from the diagonals of the inverse design matrices. We further propose a cluster-level extension that pools similar sites to improve sample efficiency, guided by prior knowledge of site similarity. Under a robust partial coverage assumption, we prove a suboptimality bound for the resulting policy. Overall, our framework addresses multi-site learning with heterogeneous data sources and provides a principled approach to robust planning without relying on strong state-action rectangularity assumptions.",

        "abstract": "Room impulse responses (RIRs) are essential for many acoustic signal processing tasks, yet measuring them densely across space is often impractical. In this work, we propose RIR-Former, a grid-free, one-step feed-forward model for RIR reconstruction. By introducing a sinusoidal encoding module into a transformer backbone, our method effectively incorporates microphone position information, enabling interpolation at arbitrary array locations. Furthermore, a segmented multi-branch decoder is designed to separately handle early reflections and late reverberation, improving reconstruction across the entire RIR. Experiments on diverse simulated acoustic environments demonstrate that RIR-Former consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of normalized mean square error (NMSE) and cosine distance (CD), under varying missing rates and array configurations. These results highlight the potential of our approach for practical deployment and motivate future work on scaling from randomly spaced linear arrays to complex array geometries, dynamic acoustic scenes, and real-world environments.",

We recast associative memory at the level of probability measures, treating a context as a distribution over tokens and viewing attention as an integral operator on measures. Concretely, for mixture contexts $\\nu = I^{-1} \\sum_{i=1}^I \\mu^{(i^*)}$ and a query $x_{\\mathrm{q}}(i^*)$, the task decomposes into (i) recall of the relevant component $\\mu^{(i^*)}$ and (ii) prediction from $(\\mu_{i^*},x_\\mathrm{q})$. We study learned softmax attention (not a frozen kernel) trained by empirical risk minimization and show that a shallow measure-theoretic Transformer composed with an MLP learns the recall-and-predict map under a spectral assumption on the input densities. We further establish a matching minimax lower bound with the same rate exponent (up to multiplicative constants), proving sharpness of the convergence order. The framework offers a principled recipe for designing and analyzing Transformers that recall from arbitrarily long, distributional contexts with provable generalization guarantees.",

Grappa is a distributed GNN training framework that enforces gradient-only communication: during each iteration, partitions train in isolation and exchange only gradients for the global update. To recover accuracy lost to isolation, Grappa (i) periodically repartitions to expose new neighborhoods and (ii) applies a lightweight coverage-corrected gradient aggregation inspired by importance sampling. We prove the corrected estimator is asymptotically unbiased under standard support and boundedness assumptions, and we derive a batch-level variant for compatibility with common deep-learning packages that minimizes mean-squared deviation from the ideal node-level correction. We also introduce a shrinkage version that improves stability in practice. Empirical results on real and synthetic graphs show that Grappa trains GNNs 4 times faster on average (up to 13 times) than state-of-the-art systems, achieves better accuracy especially for deeper models, and sustains training at the trillion-edge scale on commodity hardware. Grappa is model-agnostic, supports full-graph and mini-batch training, and does not rely on high-bandwidth interconnects or caching.",

The theory predicts a small-N operating regime of strongest non-trivial separability and clarifies how sequence length and sink similarity shape the metrics. Empirically, across LLaMA-2-7B, Gemma-7B, and Mistral-7B, measurements closely track the theoretical envelopes: top-N selection sharpens separability, sink similarity correlates with Recall. We also found that in LLaMA-2-7B heads specialize into three regimes - Retriever, Mixer, Reset - with distinct geometric signatures. Overall, attention behaves as a structured geometric classifier with measurable criteria for token selection, offering head level interpretability and informing geometry-aware sparsification and design of attention in LLMs.",

        "abstract": "In marine towed-streamer seismic acquisition, the nearest hydrophone is often two hundred meter away from the source resulting in missing near-offset traces, which degrades critical processing workflows such as surface-related multiple elimination, velocity analysis, and full-waveform inversion. Existing reconstruction methods, like transform-domain interpolation, often produce kinematic inconsistencies and amplitude distortions, while supervised deep learning approaches require complete ground-truth near-offset data that are unavailable in realistic acquisition scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a self-supervised diffusion-based framework that reconstructs missing near-offset traces without requiring near-offset reference data. Our method leverages overlapping patch extraction with single-trace shifts from the available far-offset section to train a conditional diffusion model, which learns offset-dependent statistical patterns governing event curvature, amplitude variation, and wavelet characteristics. At inference, we perform trace-by-trace recursive extrapolation from the nearest recorded offset toward zero offset, progressively propagating learned prior information from far to near offsets. The generative formulation further provides uncertainty estimates via ensemble sampling, quantifying prediction confidence where validation data are absent. Controlled validation experiments on synthetic and field datasets show substantial performance gains over conventional parabolic Radon transform baselines. Operational deployment on actual near-offset gaps demonstrates practical viability where ground-truth validation is impossible. Notably, the reconstructed waveforms preserve realistic amplitude-versus-offset trends despite training exclusively on far-offset observations, and uncertainty maps accurately identify challenging extrapolation regions.",

At the same time, these applications often involve datasets with missing values due to non-response, data corruption, or deliberate anonymization. Missing data is traditionally viewed as a limitation because it reduces the information available to analysts and can degrade model performance. In this work, we take an alternative perspective and study missing data from a privacy preservation standpoint. Intuitively, when features are missing, less information is revealed about individuals, suggesting that missingness could inherently enhance privacy. We formalize this intuition by analyzing missing data as a privacy amplification mechanism within the framework of differential privacy. We show, for the first time, that incomplete data can yield privacy amplification for differentially private algorithms.",

For conservation laws, however, long-horizon rollouts are often destabilized when learned updates violate global conservation and, in many applications, additional state bounds such as nonnegative mass and densities or concentrations constrained to [0,1]. Enforcing these coupled constraints via direct next-state regression remains difficult. We introduce a framework for learning conservative transport operators on regular grids, inspired by lattice Boltzmann-style discrete-velocity transport representations. Instead of predicting the next state, the model outputs local transport operators that update cells through neighborhood exchanges, guaranteeing discrete conservation by construction. For bounded quantities, we parameterize transport within a capacity-constrained feasible set, enforcing bounds structurally rather than by post-hoc clipping. We validate FluxNet on 1D convection-diffusion, 2D shallow water equations, 1D traffic flow, and 2D spinodal decomposition. Experiments on shallow-water equations and traffic flow show improved rollout stability and physical consistency over strong baselines. On phase-field spinodal decomposition, the method enables large time-steps with long-range transport, accelerating simulation while preserving microstructure evolution in both pointwise and statistical measures.",

We hypothesize that this behavior stems from distributional shift in fake samples and implicit priors learned during training. Specifically, models tend to overfit to superficial artifacts that do not generalize well across different generation methods, leading to a misaligned decision threshold when faced with test-time distribution shift. To address this, we propose a theoretically grounded post-hoc calibration framework based on Bayesian decision theory. In particular, we introduce a learnable scalar correction to the model's logits, optimized on a small validation set from the target distribution while keeping the backbone frozen. This parametric adjustment compensates for distributional shift in model output, realigning the decision boundary even without requiring ground-truth labels. Experiments on challenging benchmarks show that our approach significantly improves robustness without retraining, offering a lightweight and principled solution for reliable and adaptive AI-generated image detection in the open world.

Yet, training SNNs under fine temporal discretization remains a major challenge, hindering both low-latency responsiveness and the mapping of software-trained SNNs to efficient hardware. In current approaches, spiking neurons are modeled as self-recurrent units, embedded into recurrent networks to maintain state over time, and trained with BPTT or RTRL variants based on surrogate gradients. These methods scale poorly with temporal resolution, while online approximations often exhibit instability for long sequences and tend to fail at capturing temporal patterns precisely. To address these limitations, we develop spiking neurons with internal recursive memory structures that we combine with sigma-delta spike-coding. We show that this SpikingGamma model supports direct error backpropagation without surrogate gradients, can learn fine temporal patterns with minimal spiking in an online manner, and scale feedforward SNNs to complex tasks and benchmarks with competitive accuracy, all while being insensitive to the temporal resolution of the model. Our approach offers both an alternative to current recurrent SNNs trained with surrogate gradients, and a direct route for mapping SNNs to neuromorphic hardware.",

In this paper, I argue for a shift from inference-only accelerators to ultrafast on-chip learning, in which both inference and training execute directly within the FPGA fabric under deterministic, sub-microsecond latency constraints. Bringing learning into the same real-time datapath as inference would enable closed-loop systems that adapt as fast as the physical processes they control, with applications spanning quantum error correction, cryogenic qubit calibration, plasma and fusion control, accelerator tuning, and autonomous scientific experiments. Enabling such regimes requires rethinking algorithms, architectures, and toolflows jointly, but promises to transform FPGAs from static inference engines into real-time learning machines.",

This diversity might induce properties of serendipidity and novelty which might increase user engagement or revenue. However, many real-life problems arise in that case: e.g., avoiding to recommend distinct but too similar items to reduce the churn risk, and computational cost for large item libraries, up to millions of items. First, we consider the case when the user feedback model is perfectly observed and known in advance, and introduce an efficient algorithm called B-DivRec combining determinantal point processes and a fuzzy denuding procedure to adjust the degree of item diversity. This helps enforcing a quality-diversity trade-off throughout the user history. Second, we propose an approach to adaptively tailor the quality-diversity trade-off to the user, so that diversity in recommendations can be enhanced if it leads to positive feedback, and vice-versa. Finally, we illustrate the performance and versatility of B-DivRec in the two settings on synthetic and real-life data sets on movie recommendation and drug repurposing.",

        "abstract": "Machine learning models depend critically on feature quality, yet useful features are often scattered across multiple relational tables. Feature augmentation enriches a base table by discovering and integrating features from related tables through join operations. However, scaling this process to complex schemas with many tables and multi-hop paths remains challenging. Feature augmentation must address three core tasks: identify promising join paths that connect the base table to candidate tables, execute these joins to materialize augmented data, and select the most informative features from the results. Existing approaches face a fundamental tradeoff between effectiveness and efficiency: achieving high accuracy requires exploring many candidate paths, but exhaustive exploration is computationally prohibitive. Some methods compromise by considering only immediate neighbors, limiting their effectiveness, while others employ neural models that require expensive training data and introduce scalability limitations. We present Hippasus, a modular framework that achieves both goals through three key contributions. First, we combine lightweight statistical signals with semantic reasoning from Large Language Models to prune unpromising join paths before execution, focusing computational resources on high-quality candidates. Second, we employ optimized multi-way join algorithms and consolidate features from multiple paths, substantially reducing execution time. Third, we integrate LLM-based semantic understanding with statistical measures to select features that are both semantically meaningful and empirically predictive. Our experimental evaluation on publicly available datasets shows that Hippasus substantially improves feature augmentation accuracy by up to 26.8% over state-of-the-art baselines while also offering high runtime performance.",

We introduce a gated communication mechanism that dynamically determines when communication is necessary based on environmental context and agent states. Experimental evaluation on challenging coordination tasks demonstrates that our method achieves 181.8% performance improvement over no-communication baselines while reducing bandwidth usage by 41.4%. Comprehensive Pareto frontier analysis shows dominance across the entire success-bandwidth spectrum with area-under-curve of 0.198 vs 0.142 for next-best methods.

Over time, these models have evolved to capture more nuanced properties, such as the heterogeneity of relationships, leading to the concept of multilayer networks. However, the analysis and evaluation of methods for these structures is often hindered by the limited availability of large-scale empirical data. As a result, graph generators are commonly used as a workaround, albeit at the cost of introducing systematic biases. In this paper, we address the inverse-generator problem by inferring the configuration parameters of a multilayer network generator, mABCD, from a real-world system. Our goal is to identify parameter settings that enable the generator to produce synthetic networks that act as digital twins of the original structure. We propose a method for estimating matching configurations and for quantifying the associated error. Our results demonstrate that this task is non-trivial, as strong interdependencies between configuration parameters weaken independent estimation and instead favour a joint-prediction approach.",

Meeting these requirements demands low-latency, fixed-precision computation under strict memory constraints, a regime in which conventional Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) are both inefficient and numerically unstable. We identify key properties of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) that align with these constraints. Specifically, we show that: (i) KAN updates exploiting B-spline locality are sparse, enabling superior on-chip resource scaling, and (ii) KANs are inherently robust to fixed-point quantization. By implementing fixed-point online training on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), a representative platform for on-chip computation, we demonstrate that KAN-based online learners are significantly more efficient and expressive than MLPs across a range of low-latency and resource-constrained tasks.

Moreover, naive length penalties in group-relative optimization can severely hurt accuracy. We attribute this failure to two structural issues: (i) Dilution of Length Baseline, where incorrect responses (with zero length reward) depress the group baseline and over-penalize correct solutions; and (ii) Difficulty-Penalty Mismatch, where a static penalty cannot adapt to problem difficulty, suppressing necessary reasoning on hard instances while leaving redundancy on easy ones. We propose Dynamic Decoupled Conditional Advantage (DDCA) to decouple efficiency optimization from correctness. DDCA computes length advantages conditionally within the correct-response cluster to eliminate baseline dilution, and dynamically scales the penalty strength using the group pass rate as a proxy for difficulty. Experiments on GSM8K, MATH500, AMC23, and AIME25 show that DDCA consistently improves the efficiency--accuracy trade-off relative to adaptive baselines, reducing generated tokens by approximately 60% on simpler tasks (e.g., GSM8K) versus over 20% on harder benchmarks (e.g., AIME25), thereby maintaining or improving accuracy.

We present a training-free conditional diffusion model framework for learning stochastic flow maps of parameter-dependent SDEs, where both drift and diffusion coefficients depend on physical parameters. The key technical innovation is a joint kernel-weighted Monte Carlo estimator that approximates the conditional score function using trajectory data sampled at discrete parameter values, enabling interpolation across both state space and the continuous parameter domain. Once trained, the resulting generative model produces sample trajectories for any parameter value within the training range without retraining, significantly accelerating parameter studies, uncertainty quantification, and real-time filtering applications. The performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated via three numerical examples of increasing complexity, showing accurate approximation of conditional distributions across varying parameter values.",

        "abstract": "Drug-induced toxicity remains a leading cause of failure in preclinical development and early clinical trials. Detecting adverse effects at an early stage is critical to reduce attrition and accelerate the development of safe medicines. Histopathological evaluation remains the gold standard for toxicity assessment, but it relies heavily on expert pathologists, creating a bottleneck for large-scale screening. To address this challenge, we introduce an AI-based anomaly detection framework for histopathological whole-slide images (WSIs) in rodent livers from toxicology studies. The system identifies healthy tissue and known pathologies (anomalies) for which training data is available. In addition, it can detect rare pathologies without training data as out-of-distribution (OOD) findings. We generate a novel dataset of pixelwise annotations of healthy tissue and known pathologies and use this data to fine-tune a pre-trained Vision Transformer (DINOv2) via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) in order to do tissue segmentation. Finally, we extract features for OOD detection using the Mahalanobis distance. To better account for class-dependent variability in histological data, we propose the use of class-specific thresholds. We optimize the thresholds using the mean of the false negative and false positive rates, resulting in only 0.16\\% of pathological tissue classified as healthy and 0.35\\% of healthy tissue classified as pathological. Applied to mouse liver WSIs with known toxicological findings, the framework accurately detects anomalies, including rare OOD morphologies. This work demonstrates the potential of AI-driven histopathology to support preclinical workflows, reduce late-stage failures, and improve efficiency in drug development.",

This allows us to achieve interpretable control over high-order cumulants such as skewness and kurtosis through the Hermite coefficients while keeping the data model realistic. Using samples generated from the data model, we perform controlled online learning experiments with a two-layer NN. Our results reveal a moment-wise progression in training: networks first capture low-order statistics such as mean and covariance, and progressively learn high-order cumulants. Finally, we pretrain the generative model on the Fashion-MNIST dataset and leverage the generated samples for further experiments. The results of these additional experiments confirm our conclusions and show the utility of the data model in a real-world scenario. Overall, our proposed approach bridges simplified data assumptions and practical data complexity, which offers a principled framework for investigating distributional effects in machine learning and signal processing.",

However, evaluating these visual and textual search abilities is still difficult, and existing benchmarks have two major limitations. First, existing benchmarks are not visual search-centric: answers that should require visual search are often leaked through cross-textual cues in the text questions or can be inferred from the prior world knowledge in current MLLMs. Second, overly idealized evaluation scenario: On the image-search side, the required information can often be obtained via near-exact matching against the full image, while the text-search side is overly direct and insufficiently challenging. To address these issues, we construct the Vision-DeepResearch benchmark (VDR-Bench) comprising 2,000 VQA instances. All questions are created via a careful, multi-stage curation pipeline and rigorous expert review, designed to assess the behavior of Vision-DeepResearch systems under realistic real-world conditions. Moreover, to address the insufficient visual retrieval capabilities of current MLLMs, we propose a simple multi-round cropped-search workflow. This strategy is shown to effectively improve model performance in realistic visual retrieval scenarios.

We derive convergence rates of the form $n^{-1/2} + m^{-\\alpha}$ for the empirical covariance operator and the PCA excess risk, where $\\alpha>0$ depends on the chosen embedding. This characterizes the relationship between the number $n$ of measures and the number $m$ of samples per measure, revealing a sparse (small $m$) to dense (large $m$) transition in the convergence behavior. Moreover, we prove that the dense-regime rate is minimax optimal for the empirical covariance error.

These divergences remain finite under support mismatch and yield a geometric interpretation of regularization heuristics used in Kalman ensemble methods. We demonstrate the utility of these divergences in KL-regularized optimal control. In the fully tractable setting of linear time-invariant systems with Gaussian process noise, the classical KL reduces to a quadratic control penalty that becomes singular as process noise vanishes.

        "abstract": "This paper presents the DFKI-Speech system developed for the WildSpoof Challenge under the Spoofing aware Automatic Speaker Verification (SASV) track. We propose a robust SASV framework in which a spoofing detector and a speaker verification (SV) network operate in tandem. The spoofing detector employs a self-supervised speech embedding extractor as the frontend, combined with a state-of-the-art graph neural network backend. In addition, a top-3 layer based mixture-of-experts (MoE) is used to fuse high-level and low-level features for effective spoofed utterance detection. For speaker verification, we adapt a low-complexity convolutional neural network that fuses 2D and 1D features at multiple scales, trained with the SphereFace loss. Additionally, contrastive circle loss is applied to adaptively weight positive and negative pairs within each training batch, enabling the network to better distinguish between hard and easy sample pairs. Finally, fixed imposter cohort based AS Norm score normalization and model ensembling are used to further enhance the discriminative capability of the speaker verification system.",

While investigating these phenomena have recently received attention, explaining their appearance is still overlooked. Classic explainable AI (XAI) methods can surface failures at a single checkpoint of a model, but they are structurally ill-suited to justify what changed internally across different checkpoints and which explanatory claims are warranted about that change. We take the position that behavioral shifts should be explained comparatively: the core target should be the intervention-induced shift between a reference model and an intervened model, rather than any single model in isolation. To this aim we formulate a Comparative XAI ($\\Delta$-XAI) framework with a set of desiderata to be taken into account when designing proper explaining methods. To highlight how $\\Delta$-XAI methods work, we introduce a set of possible pipelines, relate them to the desiderata, and provide a concrete $\\Delta$-XAI experiment.",

Yet, the internal mechanisms driving these complex reasoning behaviors remain opaque. Existing interpretability approaches targeting reasoning either identify components (e.g., neurons) correlated with special textual patterns, or rely on human-annotated contrastive pairs to derive control vectors. Consequently, current methods struggle to precisely localize complex reasoning mechanisms or capture sequential influence from model internal workings to the reasoning outputs. In this paper, built on outcome-oriented and sequential-influence-aware principles, we focus on identifying components that have sequential contribution to reasoning behavior where outcomes are cumulated by long-range effects. We propose Integrated Policy Gradient (IPG), a novel framework that attributes reasoning behaviors to model's inner components by propagating compound outcome-based signals such as post reasoning accuracy backward through model inference trajectories. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our approach achieves more precise localization and enables reliable modulation of reasoning behaviors (e.g., reasoning capability, reasoning strength) across diverse reasoning models.",

In this work, we present a unified view that frames these interventions as dynamic weight updates induced by a control signal, placing them within a single conceptual framework. Building on this view, we propose a unified preference-utility analysis that separates control effects into preference, defined as the tendency toward a target concept, and utility, defined as coherent and task-valid generation, and measures both on a shared log-odds scale using polarity-paired contrastive examples. Across methods, we observe a consistent trade-off between preference and utility: stronger control increases preference while predictably reducing utility. We further explain this behavior through an activation manifold perspective, in which control shifts representations along target-concept directions to enhance preference, while utility declines primarily when interventions push representations off the model's valid-generation manifold. Finally, we introduce a new steering approach SPLIT guided by this analysis that improves preference while better preserving utility. Code is available at this https URL.",

This review examines the interplay between these two perspectives, focusing on the extent to which symmetry-induced constraints can be identified, encoded, or diagnosed using machine learning techniques. Rather than emphasizing architectures that enforce known symmetries by construction, we concentrate on data-driven approaches and latent representation learning, with particular attention to variational autoencoders. We discuss how symmetries and conservation laws reduce the intrinsic dimensionality of physical datasets, and how this reduction may manifest itself through self-organization of latent spaces in generative models trained to balance reconstruction and compression. We review recent results, including case studies from simple geometric systems and particle physics processes, and analyze the theoretical and practical limitations of inferring symmetry structure without explicit inductive bias.",

        "abstract": "Hierarchical federated learning (HFL) has emerged as a key architecture for large-scale wireless and Internet of Things systems, where devices communicate with nearby edge servers before reaching the cloud. In these environments, uplink bandwidth and latency impose strict communication limits, thereby making aggressive gradient compression essential. One-bit methods such as sign-based stochastic gradient descent (SignSGD) offer an attractive solution in flat federated settings, but existing theory and algorithms do not naturally extend to hierarchical settings. In particular, the interaction between majority-vote aggregation at the edge layer and model aggregation at the cloud layer, and its impact on end-to-end performance, remains unknown. To bridge this gap, we propose a highly communication-efficient sign-based HFL framework and develop its corresponding formulation for nonconvex learning, where devices send only signed stochastic gradients, edge servers combine them through majority-vote, and the cloud periodically averages the obtained edge models, while utilizing downlink quantization to broadcast the global model. We introduce the resulting scalable HFL algorithm, HierSignSGD, and provide the convergence analysis for SignSGD in a hierarchical setting. Our core technical contribution is a characterization of how biased sign compression, two-level aggregation intervals, and inter-cluster heterogeneity collectively affect convergence. Numerical experiments under homogeneous and heterogeneous data splits show that HierSignSGD, despite employing extreme compression, achieves accuracy comparable to or better than full-precision stochastic gradient descent while reducing communication cost in the process, and remains robust under aggressive downlink sparsification.",

Our approach learns a conditional generative model separately for each source domain and calibrates the generated responses to the target domain via conditional quantile matching. This distributional alignment step corrects general discrepancies between source and target domains without imposing restrictive assumptions such as covariate or label shift. The resulting framework provides a principled and flexible approach to high-quality data augmentation for downstream learning tasks in the target domain. From a theoretical perspective, we show that an empirical risk minimizer (ERM) trained on the augmented dataset achieves a tighter excess risk bound than the target-only ERM under mild conditions. In particular, we establish new convergence rates for the quantile matching estimator that governs the transfer bias-variance tradeoff. From a practical perspective, extensive simulations and real data applications demonstrate that the proposed method consistently improves prediction accuracy over target-only learning and competing transfer learning methods.",

Standard benchmarks report aggregate metrics that obscure which specific capabilities a task requires and whether a cheaper model could suffice. BELLA addresses this gap through three stages: (1) decomposing LLM outputs and extract the granular skills required by using critic-based profiling, (2) clustering skills into structured capability matrices, and (3) multi-objective optimization to select the right models to maximize performance while respecting budget constraints. BELLA provides natural-language rationale for recommendations, providing transparency that current black-box routing systems lack. We describe the framework architecture, situate it within the landscape of LLM routing and evaluation, and discuss its application to financial reasoning as a representative domain exhibiting diverse skill requirements and cost-variation across models.

Although recent generative approaches such as diffusion models, flow matching, and Implicit Maximum Likelihood Estimation (IMLE) have achieved promising results, they often satisfy only a subset of these requirements. To address this, we introduce PRISM, a single-pass policy based on a batch-global rejection-sampling variant of IMLE. PRISM couples a temporal multisensory encoder (integrating RGB, depth, tactile, audio, and proprioception) with a linear-attention generator using a Performer architecture. We demonstrate the efficacy of PRISM on a diverse real-world hardware suite, including loco-manipulation using a Unitree Go2 with a 7-DoF arm D1 and tabletop manipulation with a UR5 manipulator. Across challenging physical tasks such as pre-manipulation parking, high-precision insertion, and multi-object pick-and-place, PRISM outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion policies by 10-25% in success rate while maintaining high-frequency (30-50 Hz) closed-loop control. We further validate our approach on large-scale simulation benchmarks, including CALVIN, MetaWorld, and Robomimic. In CALVIN (10% data split), PRISM improves success rates by approximately 25% over diffusion and approximately 20% over flow matching, while simultaneously reducing trajectory jerk by 20x-50x. These results position PRISM as a fast, accurate, and multisensory imitation policy that retains multimodal action coverage without the latency of iterative sampling.",

We address this open question by establishing the first general framework for establishing generalization guarantees for tuning multi-dimensional hyperparameters in data-driven settings. Our approach strengthens the generalization guarantee framework for semi-algebraic function classes by exploiting tools from real algebraic geometry, yielding sharper, more broadly applicable guarantees. We then extend the analysis to hyperparameter tuning using the validation loss under minimal assumptions, and derive improved bounds when additional structure is available.

An augmentation stack adds further distortions to the noisy input data. The masked autoencoder model learns to remove the added distortions along with reconstructing the masked regions of the spectrogram during pre-training. The pre-trained embeddings are then used by fine-tuning models trained on a small amount of paired data for specific downstream tasks. We evaluate the pre-trained features for denoising and dereverberation downstream tasks. We explore different augmentations (like single or multi-speaker) in the pre-training augmentation stack and the effect of different noisy input feature representations (like $log1p$ compression) on pre-trained embeddings and downstream fine-tuning enhancement performance.

First, we use a fine-tuned LLM to generate plausible misconceptions, and then retrieve the most promising candidates among these using embedding similarity with the input dialogue. These candidates are then assessed and re-ranked by another fine-tuned LLM to improve misconception relevance. Empirically, we evaluate our system on real dialogues from an educational tutoring platform. We consider multiple base LLM models including LLaMA, Qwen and Claude on zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. We find that our approach improves predictive performance over baseline models and that fine-tuning improves both generated misconception quality and can outperform larger closed-source models.

        "abstract": "It is folklore that reusing training data more than once can improve the statistical efficiency of gradient-based learning. However, beyond linear regression, the theoretical advantage of full-batch gradient descent (GD, which always reuses all the data) over one-pass stochastic gradient descent (online SGD, which uses each data point only once) remains unclear. In this work, we consider learning a $d$-dimensional single-index model with a quadratic activation, for which it is known that one-pass SGD requires $n\\gtrsim d\\log d$ samples to achieve weak recovery. We first show that this $\\log d$ factor in the sample complexity persists for full-batch spherical GD on the correlation loss; however, by simply truncating the activation, full-batch GD exhibits a favorable optimization landscape at $n \\simeq d$ samples, thereby outperforming one-pass SGD (with the same activation) in statistical efficiency. We complement this result with a trajectory analysis of full-batch GD on the squared loss from small initialization, showing that $n \\gtrsim d$ samples and $T \\gtrsim\\log d$ gradient steps suffice to achieve strong (exact) recovery.",

        "abstract": "Edge AI applications increasingly require ultra-low-power, low-latency inference. Neuromorphic computing based on event-driven spiking neural networks (SNNs) offers an attractive path, but practical deployment on resource-constrained devices is limited by training difficulty, hardware-mapping overheads, and sensitivity to temporal dynamics. We present NeuEdge, a framework that combines adaptive SNN models with hardware-aware optimization for edge deployment. NeuEdge uses a temporal coding scheme that blends rate and spike-timing patterns to reduce spike activity while preserving accuracy, and a hardware-aware training procedure that co-optimizes network structure and on-chip placement to improve utilization on neuromorphic processors. An adaptive threshold mechanism adjusts neuron excitability from input statistics, reducing energy consumption without degrading performance. Across standard vision and audio benchmarks, NeuEdge achieves 91-96% accuracy with up to 2.3 ms inference latency on edge hardware and an estimated 847 GOp/s/W energy efficiency. A case study on an autonomous-drone workload shows up to 312x energy savings relative to conventional deep neural networks while maintaining real-time operation.",

        "abstract": "We study federated learning (FL) over wireless fading channels where multiple devices simultaneously send their model updates. We propose an efficient \\emph{age-aware edge-blind over-the-air FL} approach that does not require channel state information (CSI) at the devices. Instead, the parameter server (PS) uses multiple antennas and applies maximum-ratio combining (MRC) based on its estimated sum of the channel gains to detect the parameter updates. A key challenge is that the number of orthogonal subcarriers is limited; thus, transmitting many parameters requires multiple Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) symbols, which increases latency. To address this, the PS selects only a small subset of model coordinates each round using \\emph{AgeTop-\\(k\\)}, which first picks the largest-magnitude entries and then chooses the \\(k\\) coordinates with the longest waiting times since they were last selected. This ensures that all selected parameters fit into a single OFDM symbol, reducing latency. We provide a convergence bound that highlights the advantages of using a higher number of antenna array elements and demonstrates a key trade-off: increasing \\(k\\) decreases compression error at the cost of increasing the effect of channel noise. Experimental results show that (i) more PS antennas greatly improve accuracy and convergence speed; (ii) AgeTop-\\(k\\) outperforms random selection under relatively good channel conditions; and (iii) the optimum \\(k\\) depends on the channel, with smaller \\(k\\) being better in noisy settings.",

        "abstract": "Enabling humanoid robots to perform agile and adaptive interactive tasks has long been a core challenge in robotics. Current approaches are bottlenecked by either the scarcity of realistic interaction data or the need for meticulous, task-specific reward engineering, which limits their scalability. To narrow this gap, we present HumanX, a full-stack framework that compiles human video into generalizable, real-world interaction skills for humanoids, without task-specific rewards. HumanX integrates two co-designed components: XGen, a data generation pipeline that synthesizes diverse and physically plausible robot interaction data from video while supporting scalable data augmentation; and XMimic, a unified imitation learning framework that learns generalizable interaction skills. Evaluated across five distinct domains--basketball, football, badminton, cargo pickup, and reactive fighting--HumanX successfully acquires 10 different skills and transfers them zero-shot to a physical Unitree G1 humanoid. The learned capabilities include complex maneuvers such as pump-fake turnaround fadeaway jumpshots without any external perception, as well as interactive tasks like sustained human-robot passing sequences over 10 consecutive cycles--learned from a single video demonstration. Our experiments show that HumanX achieves over 8 times higher generalization success than prior methods, demonstrating a scalable and task-agnostic pathway for learning versatile, real-world robot interactive skills.",

        "abstract": "Most Large Language Model (LLM) agent memory systems rely on a small set of static, hand-designed operations for extracting memory. These fixed procedures hard-code human priors about what to store and how to revise memory, making them rigid under diverse interaction patterns and inefficient on long histories. To this end, we present \\textbf{MemSkill}, which reframes these operations as learnable and evolvable memory skills, structured and reusable routines for extracting, consolidating, and pruning information from interaction traces. Inspired by the design philosophy of agent skills, MemSkill employs a \\emph{controller} that learns to select a small set of relevant skills, paired with an LLM-based \\emph{executor} that produces skill-guided memories. Beyond learning skill selection, MemSkill introduces a \\emph{designer} that periodically reviews hard cases where selected skills yield incorrect or incomplete memories, and evolves the skill set by proposing refinements and new skills. Together, MemSkill forms a closed-loop procedure that improves both the skill-selection policy and the skill set itself. Experiments on LoCoMo, LongMemEval, HotpotQA, and ALFWorld demonstrate that MemSkill improves task performance over strong baselines and generalizes well across settings. Further analyses shed light on how skills evolve, offering insights toward more adaptive, self-evolving memory management for LLM agents.",

        "abstract": "Direct alignment methods are increasingly used to align large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, many real-world alignment problems involve multiple conflicting objectives, where naive aggregation of preferences can lead to unstable training and poor trade-offs. In particular, weighted loss methods may fail to identify update directions that simultaneously improve all objectives, and existing multi-objective approaches often rely on explicit reward models, introducing additional complexity and distorting user-specified preferences. The contributions of this paper are two-fold. First, we propose a Reward-free Alignment framework for Conflicted Objectives (RACO) that directly leverages pairwise preference data and resolves gradient conflicts via a novel clipped variant of conflict-averse gradient descent. We provide convergence guarantees to Pareto-critical points that respect user-specified objective weights, and further show that clipping can strictly improve convergence rate in the two-objective setting. Second, we improve our method using some heuristics and conduct experiments to demonstrate the compatibility of the proposed framework for LLM alignment. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations on multi-objective summarization and safety alignment tasks across multiple LLM families (Qwen 3, Llama 3, Gemma 3) show that our method consistently achieves better Pareto trade-offs compared to existing multi-objective alignment baselines.",
