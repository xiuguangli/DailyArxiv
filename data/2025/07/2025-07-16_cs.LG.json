        "abstract": "We consider the problem of tool-to-tool matching (TTTM), also called, chamber matching in the context of a semiconductor manufacturing equipment. Traditional TTTM approaches utilize static configuration data or depend on a golden reference which are difficult to obtain in a commercial manufacturing line. Further, existing methods do not extend very well to a heterogeneous setting, where equipment are of different make-and-model, sourced from different equipment vendors. We propose novel TTTM analysis pipelines to overcome these issues. We hypothesize that a mismatched equipment would have higher variance and/or higher number of modes in the data. Our best univariate method achieves a correlation coefficient >0.95 and >0.5 with the variance and number of modes, respectively showing that the proposed methods are effective. Also, the best multivariate method achieves a correlation coefficient >0.75 with the top-performing univariate methods, showing its effectiveness. Finally, we analyze the sensitivity of the multivariate algorithms to the algorithm hyper-parameters.",

However, popular pre-defined and adaptive schedulers can still lead to suboptimal generalization. This paper introduces VolSched, a novel adaptive LR scheduler inspired by the concept of volatility in stochastic processes like Geometric Brownian Motion to dynamically adjust the learning rate. By calculating the ratio between long-term and short-term accuracy volatility, VolSched increases the LR to escape plateaus and decreases it to stabilize training, allowing the model to explore the loss landscape more effectively. We evaluate VolSched on the CIFAR-100 dataset against a strong baseline using a standard augmentation pipeline. When paired with ResNet-18 and ResNet-34, our scheduler delivers consistent performance gains, improving top-1 accuracy by 1.4 and 1.3 percentage points respectively. Analysis of the loss curves reveals that VolSched promotes a longer exploration phase. A quantitative analysis of the Hessian shows that VolSched finds a final solution that is 38% flatter than the next-best baseline, allowing the model to obtain wider minima and hence better generalization performance.",

However, theoretical understanding of these models remains limited. In this paper, we examine the mathematical foundations of deep learning and Transformers and present a novel theoretical result. We review key concepts from linear algebra, probability, and optimization that underpin deep learning, and we analyze the multi-head self-attention mechanism and the backpropagation algorithm in detail. Our main contribution is a universal approximation theorem for Transformers: we prove that a single-layer Transformer, comprising one self-attention layer followed by a position-wise feed-forward network with ReLU activation, can approximate any continuous sequence-to-sequence mapping on a compact domain to arbitrary precision. We provide a formal statement and a complete proof. Finally, we present case studies that demonstrate the practical implications of this result.

We demonstrate the importance of a unified platform for comparing diverse feature selection techniques, fostering methodological consistency and rigor.

        "abstract": "Online learning, where feature spaces can change over time, offers a flexible learning paradigm that has attracted considerable attention. However, it still faces three significant challenges. First, the heterogeneity of real-world data streams with mixed feature types presents challenges for traditional parametric modeling. Second, data stream distributions can shift over time, causing an abrupt and substantial decline in model performance. Additionally, the time and cost constraints make it infeasible to label every data instance in a supervised setting. To overcome these challenges, we propose a new algorithm Online Learning from Mix-typed, Drifted, and Incomplete Streaming Features (OL-MDISF), which aims to relax restrictions on both feature types, data distribution, and supervision information. Our approach involves utilizing copula models to create a comprehensive latent space, employing an adaptive sliding window for detecting drift points to ensure model stability, and establishing label proximity information based on geometric structural relationships. To demonstrate the model's efficiency and effectiveness, we provide theoretical analysis and comprehensive experimental results. This extension serves as a standalone technical reference to the original OL-MDISF method. It provides (i) a contextual analysis of OL-MDISF within the broader landscape of online learning, covering recent advances in mixed-type feature modeling, concept drift adaptation, and weak supervision, and (ii) a comprehensive set of experiments across 14 real-world datasets under two types of drift scenarios. These include full CER trends, ablation studies, sensitivity analyses, and temporal ensemble dynamics. We hope this document can serve as a reproducible benchmark and technical resource for researchers working on nonstationary, heterogeneous, and weakly supervised data streams.",

Addressing this challenging issue is vital for practical applications. However, research in this area remains underexplored. Existing imputation methods for attribute-missing graphs often fail to account for the varying amounts of information available across node neighborhoods, leading to unreliable results, especially for nodes with insufficient known neighborhood. To address this issue, we propose a novel method named Divide-Then-Rule Graph Completion (DTRGC). This method first addresses nodes with sufficient known neighborhood information and treats the imputed results as new knowledge to iteratively impute more challenging nodes, while leveraging clustering information to correct imputation errors. Specifically, Dynamic Cluster-Aware Feature Propagation (DCFP) initializes missing node attributes by adjusting propagation weights based on the clustering structure. Subsequently, Hierarchical Neighborhood-aware Imputation (HNAI) categorizes attribute-missing nodes into three groups based on the completeness of their neighborhood attributes. The imputation is performed hierarchically, prioritizing the groups with nodes that have the most available neighborhood information. The cluster structure is then used to refine the imputation and correct potential errors. Finally, Hop-wise Representation Enhancement (HRE) integrates information across multiple hops, thereby enriching the expressiveness of node representations. Experimental results on six widely used graph datasets show that DTRGC significantly improves the clustering performance of various DGC methods under attribute-missing graphs.",

RedOne was developed through a three-stage training strategy consisting of continue pretraining, supervised fine-tuning, and preference optimization, using a large-scale real-world dataset. Through extensive experiments, RedOne maintains strong general capabilities, and achieves an average improvement up to 14.02% across 8 major SNS tasks and 7.56% in SNS bilingual evaluation benchmark, compared with base models. Furthermore, through online testing, RedOne reduced the exposure rate in harmful content detection by 11.23% and improved the click page rate in post-view search by 14.95% compared with single-tasks finetuned baseline models. These results establish RedOne as a robust domain-specific LLM for SNS, demonstrating excellent generalization across various tasks and promising applicability in real-world scenarios.",

Desalination processes are highly energy intensive and account for approximately 15% of the UAE's electricity consumption, contributing to over 22% of the country's energy-related CO2 emissions. Moreover, these processes face significant sustainability challenges in the face of climate uncertainties such as rising seawater temperatures, salinity, and aerosol optical depth (AOD). AOD greatly affects the operational and economic performance of solar-powered desalination systems through photovoltaic soiling, membrane fouling, and water turbidity cycles. This study proposes a novel pipelined two-stage predictive modelling architecture: the first stage forecasts AOD using satellite-derived time series and meteorological data; the second stage uses the predicted AOD and other meteorological factors to predict desalination performance efficiency losses. The framework achieved 98% accuracy, and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) was used to reveal key drivers of system degradation. Furthermore, this study proposes a dust-aware rule-based control logic for desalination systems based on predicted values of AOD and solar efficiency. This control logic is used to adjust the desalination plant feed water pressure, adapt maintenance scheduling, and regulate energy source switching. To enhance the practical utility of the research findings, the predictive models and rule-based controls were packaged into an interactive dashboard for scenario and predictive analytics.

However, label noise, which arises from inter-institutional data variability, can cause training instability and degrade model performance. Existing FL methods struggle with noise heterogeneity and the imbalance in medical data. Motivated by these challenges, we propose FedGSCA, a novel framework for enhancing robustness in noisy medical FL. FedGSCA introduces a Global Sample Selector that aggregates noise knowledge from all clients, effectively addressing noise heterogeneity and improving global model stability. Furthermore, we develop a Client Adaptive Adjustment (CAA) mechanism that combines adaptive threshold pseudo-label generation and Robust Credal Labeling Loss. CAA dynamically adjusts to class distributions, ensuring the inclusion of minority samples and carefully managing noisy labels by considering multiple plausible labels. This dual approach mitigates the impact of noisy data and prevents overfitting during local training, which improves the generalizability of the model. We evaluate FedGSCA on one real-world colon slides dataset and two synthetic medical datasets under various noise conditions, including symmetric, asymmetric, extreme, and heterogeneous types. The results show that FedGSCA outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, excelling in extreme and heterogeneous noise scenarios. Moreover, FedGSCA demonstrates significant advantages in improving model stability and handling complex noise, making it well-suited for real-world medical federated learning scenarios.",

        "abstract": "Traditional scaling laws in natural language processing suggest that increasing model size and training data enhances performance. However, recent studies reveal deviations, particularly in large language models, where performance improvements decelerate, which is a phenomenon known as sub-scaling. This paper revisits these scaling laws by examining the impact of data quality and training strategies on model performance. Through extensive empirical analysis of over 400 models, we identify high data density and non-optimal resource allocation as key factors contributing to sub-scaling. High data density leads to diminishing returns due to redundant information, while optimal resource allocation is crucial for sustained performance improvements. We propose a sub-optimal scaling law that better predicts performance in sub-scaling regimes, highlighting the importance of data quality and diversity.",

        "abstract": "The integration of large language models (LLMs) into automated algorithm design has shown promising potential. A prevalent approach embeds LLMs within search routines to iteratively generate and refine candidate algorithms. However, most existing methods rely on off-the-shelf LLMs trained for general coding tasks,leaving a key question open: Do we need LLMs specifically tailored for algorithm design? If so, how can such LLMs be effectively obtained and how well can they generalize across different algorithm design tasks? In this paper, we take a first step toward answering these questions by exploring fine-tuning of LLMs for algorithm design. We introduce a Diversity-Aware Rank based (DAR) sampling strategy to balance training data diversity and quality, then we leverage direct preference optimization to efficiently align LLM outputs with task objectives. Our experiments, conducted on Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct and Llama- 3.1-8B-Instruct, span three distinct algorithm design tasks. Results suggest that finetuned LLMs can significantly outperform their off-the-shelf counterparts with the smaller Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct and match the larger Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct on the admissible set problem. Moreover, we observe promising generalization: LLMs finetuned on specific algorithm design tasks also improve performance on related tasks with varying settings. These findings highlight the value of task-specific adaptation for LLMs in algorithm design and open new avenues for future research.",

Two particularly popular approaches are reinforcement learning (RL) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT), but their training dynamics are poorly understood. We present a comparative analysis of RL and SFT on the same maths problems with the same model and similar hyperparameters. We find that RL yields minor in-domain gains on maths and slight degradation on knowledge-intensive benchmarks like MMLU, while both trends are more pronounced in SFT. We also analyse model parameters across checkpoints, observing that both algorithms modify query and key weights the most. Meanwhile, SFT exhibits greater updates and also affects mid-layer MLPs more, leading us to hypothesise that this may have caused the out-of-domain degradation. We therefore investigate whether freezing parts of the model during training can mitigate the reduced performance on knowledge-intensive benchmarks. However, our results are inconclusive, with benefits on GPQA:Diamond and degradation on other benchmarks. Taken together, our observations provide a preliminary indication for why RL amplifies existing capabilities, while SFT replaces old skills with new ones.",

For each innovation we estimate both the total FLOP used in development and the FLOP/s of the hardware utilized. Innovations using significant resources double in their requirements each year. We then use this dataset to investigate the effect of compute caps on innovation. Our analysis suggests that compute caps alone are unlikely to dramatically slow AI algorithmic progress.

To address these challenges, we propose a meta-learning framework that enables agents to learn a robust initial policy and rapidly adapt to new wireless scenarios with minimal data. We implement three meta-learning architectures, model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML), recurrent neural network (RNN), and an attention-enhanced RNN, and evaluate them against a non-meta-learning DRL algorithm, proximal policy optimization (PPO) baseline, in a simulated dynamic integrated access/backhaul (IAB) environment. Our results show a clear performance gap. The attention-based meta-learning agent reaches a peak mean network throughput of 48 Mbps, while the PPO baseline decreased drastically to 10 Mbps. Furthermore, our method reduces SINR and latency violations by more than 50% compared to PPO. It also shows quick adaptation, with a fairness index 0.7, showing better resource allocation. This work proves that meta-learning is a very effective and safer option for intelligent control in complex wireless systems.",

We unify several trajectory inference techniques under the framework of gradient flow matching, providing a theoretical framework for treating optimization paths as inductive bias. We further explore architectural and algorithmic choices, including reward fine-tuning by adjoint matching, the use of autoencoders for latent weight representation, conditioning on task-specific context data, and adopting informative source distributions such as Kaiming uniform.

While it conventionally relies on meticulous feature engineering, deep learning techniques have recently shown a great promise in learning effective player and team representations directly for soccer outcome prediction. However, existing methods often overlook the heterogeneous nature of interactions among players and teams, which is crucial for accurately modeling match dynamics. To address this gap, we propose HIGFormer (Heterogeneous Interaction Graph Transformer), a novel graph-augmented transformer-based deep learning model for soccer outcome prediction. HIGFormer introduces a multi-level interaction framework that captures both fine-grained player dynamics and high-level team interactions. Specifically, it comprises (1) a Player Interaction Network, which encodes player performance through heterogeneous interaction graphs, combining local graph convolutions with a global graph-augmented transformer; (2) a Team Interaction Network, which constructs interaction graphs from a team-to-team perspective to model historical match relationships; and (3) a Match Comparison Transformer, which jointly analyzes both team and player-level information to predict match outcomes. Extensive experiments on the WyScout Open Access Dataset, a large-scale real-world soccer dataset, demonstrate that HIGFormer significantly outperforms existing methods in prediction accuracy. Furthermore, we provide valuable insights into leveraging our model for player performance evaluation, offering a new perspective on talent scouting and team strategy analysis.",

However, prevailing on-policy RL methods often contend with significant training instability and inefficiency. This is primarily due to a capacity-difficulty mismatch, where the complexity of training data frequently outpaces the model's current capabilities, leading to critically sparse reward signals and stalled learning progress. This challenge is particularly acute for smaller, more resource-efficient LLMs. To overcome this, we introduce the Guided Hybrid Policy Optimization (GHPO), a novel difficulty-aware reinforcement learning framework. GHPO dynamically calibrates task difficulty by employing adaptive prompt refinement to provide targeted guidance. This unique approach adaptively balances direct imitation learning for problems currently beyond the model's reach with exploration-based reinforcement learning for more manageable tasks, effectively creating a smooth and optimized learning curriculum. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GHPO achieves an average performance gain of approximately 5% across six challenging mathematics benchmarks, consistently outperforming strong on-policy reinforcement learning and curriculum learning baselines. Further analysis confirms that our framework significantly enhances both training stability and final reasoning performance, thus offering a scalable and efficient solution for developing powerful and robust reasoning models.",

        "abstract": "A growing issue within conservation bioacoustics is the task of analysing the vast amount of data generated from the use of passive acoustic monitoring devices. In this paper, we present an alternative AI model which has the potential to help alleviate this problem. Our model formulation addresses the key issues encountered when using current AI models for bioacoustic analysis, namely the: limited training data available; environmental impact, particularly in energy consumption and carbon footprint of training and implementing these models; and associated hardware requirements. The model developed in this work uses associative memory via a transparent, explainable Hopfield neural network to store signals and detect similar signals which can then be used to classify species. Training is rapid ($3$\\,ms), as only one representative signal is required for each target sound within a dataset. The model is fast, taking only $5.4$\\,s to pre-process and classify all $10384$ publicly available bat recordings, on a standard Apple MacBook Air. The model is also lightweight with a small memory footprint of $144.09$\\,MB of RAM usage. Hence, the low computational demands make the model ideal for use on a variety of standard personal devices with potential for deployment in the field via edge-processing devices. It is also competitively accurate, with up to $86\\%$ precision on the dataset used to evaluate the model. In fact, we could not find a single case of disagreement between model and manual identification via expert field guides. Although a dataset of bat echolocation calls was chosen to demo this first-of-its-kind AI model, trained on only two representative calls, the model is not species specific. In conclusion, we propose an equitable AI model that has the potential to be a game changer for fast, lightweight, sustainable, transparent, explainable and accurate bioacoustic analysis.",

        "abstract": "A major challenge in the use of neural networks both for modeling human cognitive function and for artificial intelligence is the design of systems with the capacity to efficiently learn functions that support radical generalization. At the roots of this is the capacity to discover and implement symmetry functions. In this paper, we investigate a paradigmatic example of radical generalization through the use of symmetry: base addition. We present a group theoretic analysis of base addition, a fundamental and defining characteristic of which is the carry function -- the transfer of the remainder, when a sum exceeds the base modulus, to the next significant place. Our analysis exposes a range of alternative carry functions for a given base, and we introduce quantitative measures to characterize these. We then exploit differences in carry functions to probe the inductive biases of neural networks in symmetry learning, by training neural networks to carry out base addition using different carries, and comparing efficacy and rate of learning as a function of their structure. We find that even simple neural networks can achieve radical generalization with the right input format and carry function, and that learnability is closely correlated with carry function structure. We then discuss the relevance this has for cognitive science and machine learning.",

We introduce a neural-surrogate (neural-network--based approximation of the posterior distribution) framework that predicts the coefficients of known covariate-dependent rate functions directly from noisy, partially observed token trajectories. Our model employs a lightweight 1D Convolutional Residual Network trained end-to-end on Gillespie-simulated SPN realizations, learning to invert system dynamics under realistic conditions of event dropout. During inference, Monte Carlo dropout provides calibrated uncertainty bounds together with point estimates. On synthetic SPNs with 20% missing events, our surrogate recovers rate-function coefficients with an RMSE = 0.108 and substantially runs faster than traditional Bayesian approaches. These results demonstrate that data-driven, likelihood-free surrogates can enable accurate, robust, and real-time parameter recovery in complex, partially observed discrete-event systems.",

Our primary contribution lies in a novel modeling framework that integrates robustness against training data contamination with robustness against distributional shifts, alongside an efficient algorithm inspired by robust statistics to solve the resulting optimization problem. We prove that our method achieves an estimation error of $O(\\sqrt{\\epsilon})$ for the true DRO objective value using only the contaminated data under the bounded covariance assumption.

While recent studies have introduced some methods to improve prediction performance, these approaches still face a significant challenge in handling long-term extrapolation tasks under such complex scenarios. To overcome this challenge, we propose Phy-SSM, a generalizable method that integrates partial physics knowledge into state space models (SSMs) for long-term dynamics forecasting in complex environments. Our motivation is that SSMs can effectively capture long-range dependencies in sequential data and model continuous dynamical systems, while the incorporation of physics knowledge improves generalization ability. The key challenge lies in how to seamlessly incorporate partially known physics into SSMs. To achieve this, we decompose partially known system dynamics into known and unknown state matrices, which are integrated into a Phy-SSM unit. To further enhance long-term prediction performance, we introduce a physics state regularization term to make the estimated latent states align with system dynamics. Besides, we theoretically analyze the uniqueness of the solutions for our method. Extensive experiments on three real-world applications, including vehicle motion prediction, drone state prediction, and COVID-19 epidemiology forecasting, demonstrate the superior performance of Phy-SSM over the baselines in both long-term interpolation and extrapolation tasks.

Our theoretical results demonstrate that in contrast to optimization, sampling does not require exploration. To further connect our findings with those of multi-armed bandits, we define a continuous family of problems and associated regret measures that smoothly interpolates and unifies multi-armed sampling and multi-armed bandit problems using a temperature parameter. We believe the multi-armed sampling framework, and our findings in this setting can have a foundational role in the study of sampling including recent neural samplers, akin to the role of multi-armed bandits in reinforcement learning.

Most existing work on causal inference primarily focuses on event types within the designated domain, without considering the impact of exogenous out-of-domain interventions. In real-world settings, these out-of-domain interventions can significantly alter causal dynamics. To address this gap, we propose a new causal framework to define average treatment effect (ATE), beyond independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) data in classic Rubin's causal framework, to capture the causal relation shift between events of temporal process under out-of-domain intervention. We design an unbiased ATE estimator, and devise a Transformer-based neural network model to handle both long-range temporal dependencies and local patterns while integrating out-of-domain intervention information into process modeling. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines in ATE estimation and goodness-of-fit under out-of-domain-augmented point processes.",

It is a classic problem in revenue management and finds applications across various industries. However, the problem is usually NP-hard due to its combinatorial and non-linear nature. In this work, we explore how graph concolutional networks (GCNs) can be leveraged to efficiently solve constrained assortment optimization under the mixed multinomial logit choice model. We first develop a graph representation of the assortment problem, then train a GCN to learn the patterns of optimal assortments, and lastly propose two inference policies based on the GCN's output. Due to the GCN's inherent ability to generalize across inputs of varying sizes, we can use a GCN trained on small-scale instances to facilitate large-scale instances. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that given a GCN trained on small-scale instances (e.g., with 20 products), the proposed policies can achieve superior performance (90%+ optimality) on large-scale instances (with up to 2,000 products) within seconds, which outperform existing heuristic policies in both performance and efficiency. Furthermore, we extend our framework to a model-free setting where the underlying choice model is unknown but transaction data is available. We also conduct numerical experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed policies in this setting.",

A major challenge in offline RL is distributional shift, where the learned policy deviates from the dataset distribution, potentially leading to unreliable out-of-distribution actions. To mitigate this issue, regularization techniques have been employed. While many existing methods utilize density ratio-based measures, such as the $f$-divergence, for regularization, we propose an approach that utilizes the Wasserstein distance, which is robust to out-of-distribution data and captures the similarity between actions. Our method employs input-convex neural networks (ICNNs) to model optimal transport maps, enabling the computation of the Wasserstein distance in a discriminator-free manner, thereby avoiding adversarial training and ensuring stable learning. Our approach demonstrates comparable or superior performance to widely used existing methods on the D4RL benchmark dataset. The code is available at this https URL .",

        "abstract": "Cognitive reappraisal is a key strategy in emotion regulation, involving reinterpretation of emotionally charged stimuli to alter affective responses. Despite its central role in clinical and cognitive science, real-world reappraisal interventions remain cognitively demanding, abstract, and primarily verbal. This reliance on higher-order cognitive and linguistic processes is often impaired in individuals with trauma or depression, limiting the effectiveness of standard approaches. Here, we propose a novel, visually based augmentation of cognitive reappraisal by integrating large-scale text-to-image diffusion models into the emotional regulation process. Specifically, we introduce a system in which users reinterpret emotionally negative images via spoken reappraisals, which are transformed into supportive, emotionally congruent visualizations using stable diffusion models with a fine-tuned IP-adapter. This generative transformation visually instantiates users' reappraisals while maintaining structural similarity to the original stimuli, externalizing and reinforcing regulatory intent. To test this approach, we conducted a within-subject experiment (N = 20) using a modified cognitive emotion regulation (CER) task. Participants reappraised or described aversive images from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS), with or without AI-generated visual feedback. Results show that AI-assisted reappraisal significantly reduced negative affect compared to both non-AI and control conditions. Further analyses reveal that sentiment alignment between participant reappraisals and generated images correlates with affective relief, suggesting that multimodal coherence enhances regulatory efficacy. These findings demonstrate that generative visual input can support cogitive reappraisal and open new directions at the intersection of generative AI, affective computing, and therapeutic technology.",

        "abstract": "Neurons exhibit intricate geometries within their neurite networks, which play a crucial role in processes such as signaling and nutrient transport. Accurate simulation of material transport in the networks is essential for understanding these biological phenomena but poses significant computational challenges because of the complex tree-like structures involved. Traditional approaches are time-intensive and resource-demanding, yet the inherent properties of neuron trees, which consists primarily of pipes with steady-state parabolic velocity profiles and bifurcations, provide opportunities for computational optimization. To address these challenges, we propose a Graph-Autoencoder-based Latent Dynamics Surrogate (GALDS) model, which is specifically designed to streamline the simulation of material transport in neural trees. GALDS employs a graph autoencoder to encode latent representations of the network's geometry, velocity fields, and concentration profiles. These latent space representations are then assembled into a global graph, which is subsequently used to predict system dynamics in the latent space via a trained graph latent space system dynamic model, inspired by the Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) concept. The integration of an autoencoder allows for the use of smaller graph neural network models with reduced training data requirements. Furthermore, the Neural ODE component effectively mitigates the issue of error accumulation commonly encountered in recurrent neural networks. The effectiveness of the GALDS model is demonstrated through results on eight unseen geometries and four abnormal transport examples, where our approach achieves mean relative error of 3% with maximum relative error <8% and demonstrates a 10-fold speed improvement compared to previous surrogate model approaches.",

The determination of product and service tax codes, such as HSN or SAC is a major use case in Tax compliance. An accurate determination of such codes is imperative to avoid any tax penalties. This paper proposes a domain-adaptive small language model (SLM) with an encoder-decoder architecture for the enhanced prediction of product and service tax codes. In this approach, we address the problem of predicting hierarchical tax code sequences using unstructured product and services data. We employ an SLM based upon encoder-decoder architecture as this enables sequential generation of tax codes to capture the hierarchical dependencies present within the tax codes. Our experiments demonstrate that encoder-decoder SLMs can be successfully applied to the sequential prediction of structured tax codes, a domain that remains comparatively unexplored in current NLP research. In this paper, we demonstrate the superior performance of the domain-adaptive encoder-decoder SLMs over flat classifiers when applied to the Harmonized System of Nomenclature (HSN), and achieve superior results compared to decoder-only and encoder-only architectures for structured sequence generation tasks. This approach can also be scaled to other government-mandated tax commodity codes, such as United Nations Standard Products and Services Codes (UNSPSC), or Brazil's Nomenclatura Comum do Mercosul (NCM).",

In this paper, we investigate the problem of adversarial unlearning, where a malicious party intentionally sends unlearn requests to deteriorate the model's performance maximally. We show that this phenomenon and the adversary's capabilities depend on many factors, primarily on the backbone model itself and strategy/limitations in selecting data to be unlearned.

The actual drain and shipping costs are determined by complex production systems that manage the planning and execution of customers' orders fulfillment, i.e. from where and how to ship a unit to be delivered to a customer. Accurately modeling these processes is critical for regional inventory planning, especially when using Reinforcement Learning (RL) to develop control policies. For the RL usecase, a drain model is incorporated into a simulator to produce long rollouts, which we desire to be differentiable. While simulating the calls to the internal software systems can be used to recover this transition, they are non-differentiable and too slow and costly to run within an RL training environment. Accordingly, we frame this as a probabilistic forecasting problem, modeling the joint distribution of outbound drain and shipping costs across all warehouses at each time period, conditioned on inventory positions and exogenous customer demand. To ensure robustness in an RL environment, the model must handle out-of-distribution scenarios that arise from off-policy trajectories. We propose a validation scheme that leverages production systems to evaluate the drain model on counterfactual inventory states induced by RL policies. Preliminary results demonstrate the model's accuracy within the in-distribution setting.",

        "abstract": "High-quality training data is essential for building reliable and efficient machine learning systems. One-shot coreset selection addresses this by pruning the dataset while maintaining or even improving model performance, often relying on training-dynamics-based data difficulty scores. However, most existing methods implicitly assume class-wise homogeneity in data difficulty, overlooking variation in data difficulty across different classes. In this work, we challenge this assumption by showing that, in domains such as network intrusion detection and medical imaging, data difficulty often clusters by class. We formalize this as class-difficulty separability and introduce the Class Difficulty Separability Coefficient (CDSC) as a quantitative measure. We demonstrate that high CDSC values correlate with performance degradation in class-agnostic coreset methods, which tend to overrepresent easy majority classes while neglecting rare but informative ones. To address this, we introduce class-proportional variants of multiple sampling strategies. Evaluated on five diverse datasets spanning security and medical domains, our methods consistently achieve state-of-the-art data efficiency. For instance, on CTU-13, at an extreme 99% pruning rate, a class-proportional variant of Coverage-centric Coreset Selection (CCS-CP) shows remarkable stability, with accuracy dropping only 2.58%, precision 0.49%, and recall 0.19%. In contrast, the class-agnostic CCS baseline, the next best method, suffers sharper declines of 7.59% in accuracy, 4.57% in precision, and 4.11% in recall. We further show that aggressive pruning enhances generalization in noisy, imbalanced, and large-scale datasets. Our results underscore that explicitly modeling class-difficulty separability leads to more effective, robust, and generalizable data pruning, particularly in high-stakes scenarios.",

Traditional deep learning approaches, such as Casanovo, mainly utilize autoregressive decoders and predict amino acids sequentially. Subsequently, they encounter cascading errors and fail to leverage high-confidence regions effectively. To address these issues, this paper investigates using diffusion decoders adapted for the discrete data domain. These decoders provide a different approach, allowing sequence generation to start from any peptide segment, thereby enhancing prediction accuracy. We experiment with three different diffusion decoder designs, knapsack beam search, and various loss functions. We find knapsack beam search did not improve performance metrics and simply replacing the transformer decoder with a diffusion decoder lowered performance. Although peptide precision and recall were still 0, the best diffusion decoder design with the DINOISER loss function obtained a statistically significant improvement in amino acid recall by 0.373 compared to the baseline autoregressive decoder-based Casanovo model. These findings highlight the potential of diffusion decoders to not only enhance model sensitivity but also drive significant advancements in peptide de novo sequencing.",

        "abstract": "Adversarial attacks on tabular data present fundamental challenges distinct from image or text domains due to the heterogeneous nature of mixed categorical and numerical features. Unlike images where pixel perturbations maintain visual similarity, tabular data lacks intuitive similarity metrics, making it difficult to define imperceptible modifications. Additionally, traditional gradient-based methods prioritise $\\ell_p$-norm constraints, often producing adversarial examples that deviate from the original data distributions, making them detectable. We propose a latent space perturbation framework using a mixed-input Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to generate imperceptible adversarial examples. The proposed VAE integrates categorical embeddings and numerical features into a unified latent manifold, enabling perturbations that preserve statistical consistency. We specify In-Distribution Success Rate (IDSR) to measure the proportion of adversarial examples that remain statistically indistinguishable from the input distribution. Evaluation across six publicly available datasets and three model architectures demonstrates that our method achieves substantially lower outlier rates and more consistent performance compared to traditional input-space attacks and other VAE-based methods adapted from image domain approaches. Our comprehensive analysis includes hyperparameter sensitivity, sparsity control mechanisms, and generative architectural comparisons, revealing that VAE-based attacks depend critically on reconstruction quality but offer superior practical utility when sufficient training data is available. This work highlights the importance of on-manifold perturbations for realistic adversarial attacks on tabular data, offering a robust approach for practical deployment.

AdaMuon augments Muon with two mutually dependent modules: (1) a per-parameter second-moment modulation that captures orthogonal gradient updates to ensure update-level adaptivity, and (2) a RMS-aligned rescaling that regulates the overall update magnitude by aligning it with the intrinsic structure of the parameter space. Empirical results on multiple model scales and learning-rate regimes confirm that AdaMuon consistently outperforms the original Muon, delivering higher acceleration in convergence while maintaining training stability.

Machine learning models, including Deep Neural Networks, Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting, and Gaussian Process Regressor, were employed to assess the potential to predict TKE from temperature perturbations and explore temporal and spatial dynamics of correlations. Data visualization and correlation analyses revealed patterns and relationships between thermocouple temperatures and TKE, providing insight into the underlying dynamics. More accurate predictions of TKE were achieved by employing various machine learning models despite a weak correlation between the predictors and the target variable. The results demonstrate significant success, particularly from regression models, in accurately predicting the TKE. The findings of this study demonstrate a novel numerical approach to identifying new relationships between temperature and airflow processes in and around the fire environment. These relationships can help refine our understanding of combustion environment processes and the coupling and decoupling of fire environment processes necessary for improving fire operations strategy and fire and smoke model predictions. The findings of this study additionally highlight the valuable role of machine learning techniques in analyzing the complex large datasets of the fire environments, showcasing their potential to advance fire research and management practices.",

        "abstract": "Post-training quantization (PTQ) offers an efficient approach to compressing large language models (LLMs), significantly reducing memory access and computational costs. Existing compensation-based weight calibration methods often rely on a second-order Taylor expansion to model quantization error, under the assumption that the first-order term is negligible in well-trained full-precision models. However, we reveal that the progressive compensation process introduces accumulated first-order deviations between latent weights and their full-precision counterparts, making this assumption fundamentally flawed. To address this, we propose FOEM, a novel PTQ method that explicitly incorporates first-order gradient terms to improve quantization error compensation. FOEM approximates gradients by directly computing the difference between latent and full-precision weights, avoiding the high cost and limited generalization of backpropagation-based gradient computation. This approach introduces minimal additional computational overhead. Moreover, FOEM leverages precomputed Cholesky factors to efficiently recover the inverse of Hessian submatrices in real time. Extensive experiments across a wide range of models and benchmarks demonstrate that FOEM consistently outperforms the classical GPTQ method. In 3-bit weight-only quantization, FOEM reduces the perplexity of Llama3-8B by 89.6%, and improves the 5-shot MMLU accuracy of Llama3-70B from 51.7% to 74.9%, approaching the full-precision performance of 78.6%. Furthermore, FOEM can be seamlessly integrated with advanced techniques such as GPTAQ and SpinQuant, yielding additional improvements under the challenging W4A4KV4 setting, and further narrowing the accuracy gap with full-precision baselines beyond what current state-of-the-art methods achieve.

On the other hand, pathwise policy gradients alleviate the training variance, but are reliable only when driven by an accurate action-conditioned value function which is notoriously hard to train without relying on past off-policy data. In this paper, we discuss how to construct a value-gradient driven, on-policy algorithm that allow training Q-value models purely from on-policy data, unlocking the possibility of using pathwise policy updates in the context of on-policy learning. We show how to balance stochastic policies for exploration with constrained policy updates for stable training, and evaluate important architectural components that facilitate accurate value function learning. Building on these insights, we propose Relative Entropy Pathwise Policy Optimization (REPPO), an efficient on-policy algorithm that combines the sample-efficiency of pathwise policy gradients with the simplicity and minimal memory footprint of standard on-policy learning. We demonstrate that REPPO provides strong empirical performance at decreased sample requirements, wall-clock time, memory footprint as well as high hyperparameter robustness in a set of experiments on two standard GPU-parallelized benchmarks.",

        "abstract": "Accurate indoor localization is crucial for enabling spatial context in smart environments and navigation systems. Wi-Fi Received Signal Strength (RSS) fingerprinting is a widely used indoor localization approach due to its compatibility with mobile embedded devices. Deep Learning (DL) models improve accuracy in localization tasks by learning RSS variations across locations, but they assume fingerprint vectors exist in a Euclidean space, failing to incorporate spatial relationships and the non-uniform distribution of real-world RSS noise. This results in poor generalization across heterogeneous mobile devices, where variations in hardware and signal processing distort RSS readings. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can improve upon conventional DL models by encoding indoor locations as nodes and modeling their spatial and signal relationships as edges. However, GNNs struggle with non-Euclidean noise distributions and suffer from the GNN blind spot problem, leading to degraded accuracy in environments with dense access points (APs). To address these challenges, we propose GATE, a novel framework that constructs an adaptive graph representation of fingerprint vectors while preserving an indoor state-space topology, modeling the non-Euclidean structure of RSS noise to mitigate environmental noise and address device heterogeneity. GATE introduces 1) a novel Attention Hyperspace Vector (AHV) for enhanced message passing, 2) a novel Multi-Dimensional Hyperspace Vector (MDHV) to mitigate the GNN blind spot, and 3) an new Real-Time Edge Construction (RTEC) approach for dynamic graph adaptation. Extensive real-world evaluations across multiple indoor spaces with varying path lengths, AP densities, and heterogeneous devices demonstrate that GATE achieves 1.6x to 4.72x lower mean localization errors and 1.85x to 4.57x lower worst-case errors compared to state-of-the-art indoor localization frameworks.",

A reliable similarity metric could establish meaningful relationships between instances, enabling more effective evaluation of instance set heterogeneity and providing better guidance to solvers, particularly when machine learning is involved. Existing similarity metrics often lack precision in identifying instance classes or rely heavily on labeled data, which limits their applicability and generalization. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces the first mathematical distance metric for MILP instances, derived directly from their mathematical formulations. By discretizing right-hand sides, weights, and variables into classes, the proposed metric draws inspiration from the Earth mover's distance to quantify mismatches in weight-variable distributions for constraint comparisons. This approach naturally extends to enable instance-level comparisons. We evaluate both an exact and a greedy variant of our metric under various parameter settings, using the StrIPLIB dataset. Results show that all components of the metric contribute to class identification, and that the greedy version achieves accuracy nearly identical to the exact formulation while being nearly 200 times faster. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, including feature-based, image-based, and neural network models, our unsupervised method consistently outperforms all non-learned approaches and rivals the performance of a supervised classifier on class and subclass grouping tasks.",

        "abstract": "Autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) rely on global navigation satellite system (GNSS) pseudorange measurements for accurate real-time localization and navigation. However, this dependence exposes them to sophisticated spoofing threats, where adversaries manipulate pseudoranges to deceive UAV receivers. Among these, drift-evasive spoofing attacks subtly perturb measurements, gradually diverting the UAVs trajectory without triggering conventional signal-level anti-spoofing mechanisms. Traditional distributional shift detection techniques often require accumulating a threshold number of samples, causing delays that impede rapid detection and timely response. Consequently, robust temporal-scale detection methods are essential to identify attack onset and enable contingency planning with alternative sensing modalities, improving resilience against stealthy adversarial manipulations. This study explores a Bayesian online change point detection (BOCPD) approach that monitors temporal shifts in value estimates from a reinforcement learning (RL) critic network to detect subtle behavioural deviations in UAV navigation. Experimental results show that this temporal value-based framework outperforms conventional GNSS spoofing detectors, temporal semi-supervised learning frameworks, and the Page-Hinkley test, achieving higher detection accuracy and lower false-positive and false-negative rates for drift-evasive spoofing attacks.",

Although these models have demonstrated notable improvements, several limitations remain. Most existing approaches adopt the component-wise architecture, necessitating the construction of a separate model for each time series, which results in substantial computational costs. In addition, imposing the sparsity-inducing penalty on the first-layer weights of the neural network to extract causal relationships weakens the model's ability to capture complex interactions. To address these limitations, we propose Gradient Regularization-based Neural Granger Causality (GRNGC), which requires only one time series prediction model and applies $L_{1}$ regularization to the gradient between model's input and output to infer Granger causality. Moreover, GRNGC is not tied to a specific time series forecasting model and can be implemented with diverse architectures such as KAN, MLP, and LSTM, offering enhanced flexibility. Numerical simulations on DREAM, Lorenz-96, fMRI BOLD, and CausalTime show that GRNGC outperforms existing baselines and significantly reduces computational overhead. Meanwhile, experiments on real-world DNA, Yeast, HeLa, and bladder urothelial carcinoma datasets further validate the model's effectiveness in reconstructing gene regulatory networks.",

        "abstract": "Heart disease remains a major global health concern, particularly in regions with limited access to medical resources and diagnostic facilities. Traditional diagnostic methods often fail to accurately identify and manage heart disease risks, leading to adverse outcomes. Machine learning has the potential to significantly enhance the accuracy, efficiency, and speed of heart disease diagnosis. In this study, we proposed a comprehensive framework that combines classification models for heart disease detection and regression models for risk prediction. We employed the Heart Disease dataset, which comprises 1,035 cases. To address the issue of class imbalance, the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) was applied, resulting in the generation of an additional 100,000 synthetic data points. Performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, R2, MSE, RMSE, and MAE, were used to evaluate the model's effectiveness. Among the classification models, Random Forest emerged as the standout performer, achieving an accuracy of 97.2% on real data and 97.6% on synthetic data. For regression tasks, Linear Regression demonstrated the highest R2 values of 0.992 and 0.984 on real and synthetic datasets, respectively, with the lowest error metrics. Additionally, Explainable AI techniques were employed to enhance the interpretability of the models. This study highlights the potential of machine learning to revolutionize heart disease diagnosis and risk prediction, thereby facilitating early intervention and enhancing clinical decision-making.",

We then propose a privacy-preserving mechanism and integrate it into a novel one-shot distributed learning framework, aiming to simultaneously meet both privacy requirements and prediction performance objectives. Within the framework of statistical learning theory, we theoretically demonstrate that the proposed distributed learning framework can achieve the optimal prediction performance under specific privacy requirements.

When the dataset is linearly separable, it is known that the iterates converge in direction to the maximum-margin separator regardless of how large the step size is. In the non-separable case, however, it has been shown that GD can exhibit a cycling behaviour even when the step sizes is still below the stability threshold $2/\\lambda$, where $\\lambda$ is the largest eigenvalue of the Hessian at the solution. This short paper explores whether restricting the data to have equal magnitude is a sufficient condition for global convergence, under any step size below the stability threshold. We prove that this is true in a one dimensional space, but in higher dimensions cycling behaviour can still occur. We hope to inspire further studies on quantifying how common these cycles are in realistic datasets, as well as finding sufficient conditions to guarantee global convergence with large step sizes.",

Current methods typically involve feature extraction from users' historical behavior sequences combined with product information, feeding into a discriminative model that is trained on user feedback to estimate CTR. With the success of models such as GPT, the potential for generative models to enrich expressive power beyond discriminative models has become apparent. In light of this, we introduce a novel model that leverages generative models to enhance the precision of CTR predictions in discriminative models. To reconcile the disparate data aggregation needs of both model types, we design a two-stage training process: 1) Generative pre-training for next-item prediction with the given item category in user behavior sequences; 2) Fine-tuning the well-trained generative model within a discriminative CTR prediction framework. Our method's efficacy is substantiated through extensive experiments on a new dataset, and its significant utility is further corroborated by online A/B testing results. Currently, the model is deployed on one of the world's largest e-commerce platforms, and we intend to release the associated code and dataset in the future.",

This bound is computed by storing past value network outputs in the experience replay buffer, effectively utilizing data that is usually discarded. Extensive experiments across the Atari 2600 and MuJoCo domains on various agents, such as DQN and SAC, achieve up to 2,427% higher reward ratio, outperforming the same agents without our proposed term, and reducing the experience replay buffer size by up to 96%, significantly improving sample efficiency at negligible cost.",

We establish that after $T$ steps of SGD on $\\beta$-smooth convex loss functions with stepsize $\\eta \\leq 1/\\beta$, the last iterate exhibits expected excess risk $\\widetilde{O}(1/(\\eta T^{1-\\beta\\eta/2}) + \\eta T^{\\beta\\eta/2} \\sigma_\\star^2)$, where $\\sigma_\\star^2$ denotes the variance of the stochastic gradients at the optimum. In particular, for a well-tuned stepsize we obtain a near optimal $\\widetilde{O}(1/T + \\sigma_\\star/\\sqrt{T})$ rate for the last iterate, extending the results of Varre et al.

Our model assigns a fairness score to LLM reasoning, enabling the system to down-weight biased trajectories and favor equitable ones when aggregating decisions across reasoning chains. We show that a single Fairness Reward Model, trained on weakly supervised, LLM-annotated examples of biased versus unbiased reasoning, transfers across tasks, domains, and model families without additional fine-tuning.

There is, however, scepticism in the NeSy community around the scenarios in which the independence assumption actually limits NeSy systems (Faronius and Dos Martires, 2025). In this work, we settle this question by formally showing that assuming independence among symbolic concepts entails that a model can never represent uncertainty over certain concept combinations. Thus, the model fails to be aware of reasoning shortcuts, i.e., the pathological behaviour of NeSy predictors that predict correct downstream tasks but for the wrong reasons.",

Our approach introduces local, layer-wise losses leveraging the principle of matching pairwise distances from multi-dimensional scaling, enhanced with optional reward-driven guidance. This method allows each hidden layer to be trained using local signals computed during forward propagation, thus eliminating the need for backward passes and storing intermediate activations. Our experiments, conducted with policy gradient methods across common RL benchmarks, demonstrate that this backpropagation-free method achieves competitive performance compared to their classical BP-based counterpart.

In contrast, neural network models suffer from catastrophic forgetting: a significant degradation in performance on previously learned tasks when acquiring new information. The Complementary Learning Systems (CLS) theory offers an explanation for this human ability, proposing that the brain has distinct systems for pattern separation (encoding distinct memories) and pattern completion (retrieving complete memories from partial cues). To capture these complementary functions, we leverage the representational generalization capabilities of variational autoencoders (VAEs) and the robust memory storage properties of Modern Hopfield networks (MHNs), combining them into a neurally plausible continual learning model. We evaluate this model on the Split-MNIST task, a popular continual learning benchmark, and achieve close to state-of-the-art accuracy (~90%), substantially reducing forgetting. Representational analyses empirically confirm the functional dissociation: the VAE underwrites pattern completion, while the MHN drives pattern separation. By capturing pattern separation and completion in scalable architectures, our work provides a functional template for modeling memory consolidation, generalization, and continual learning in both biological and artificial systems.",

        "abstract": "Multi-task learning (MTL) has shown effectiveness in exploiting shared information across tasks to improve generalization. MTL assumes tasks share similarities that can improve performance. In addition, boosting algorithms have demonstrated exceptional performance across diverse learning problems, primarily due to their ability to focus on hard-to-learn instances and iteratively reduce residual errors. This makes them a promising approach for learning multi-task problems. However, real-world MTL scenarios often involve tasks that are not well-aligned (known as outlier or adversarial tasks), which do not share beneficial similarities with others and can, in fact, deteriorate the performance of the overall model. To overcome this challenge, we propose Robust-Multi-Task Gradient Boosting (R-MTGB), a novel boosting framework that explicitly models and adapts to task heterogeneity during training. R-MTGB structures the learning process into three sequential blocks: (1) learning shared patterns, (2) partitioning tasks into outliers and non-outliers with regularized parameters, and (3) fine-tuning task-specific predictors. This architecture enables R-MTGB to automatically detect and penalize outlier tasks while promoting effective knowledge transfer among related tasks. Our method integrates these mechanisms seamlessly within gradient boosting, allowing robust handling of noisy or adversarial tasks without sacrificing accuracy. Extensive experiments on both synthetic benchmarks and real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach successfully isolates outliers, transfers knowledge, and consistently reduces prediction errors for each task individually, and achieves overall performance gains across all tasks. These results highlight robustness, adaptability, and reliable convergence of R-MTGB in challenging MTL environments.",

        "abstract": "Activation functions are critical to the performance of deep neural networks, particularly in domains such as functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), where nonlinearity, low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and signal variability poses significant challenges to model accuracy. However, the impact of activation functions on deep learning (DL) performance in the fNIRS domain remains underexplored and lacks systematic investigation in the current literature. This study evaluates a range of conventional and field-specific activation functions for fNIRS classification tasks using multiple deep learning architectures, including the domain-specific fNIRSNet, AbsoluteNet, MDNN, and shallowConvNet (as the baseline), all tested on a single dataset recorded during an auditory task. To ensure fair a comparison, all networks were trained and tested using standardized preprocessing and consistent training parameters. The results show that symmetrical activation functions such as Tanh and the Absolute value function Abs(x) can outperform commonly used functions like the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), depending on the architecture. Additionally, a focused analysis of the role of symmetry was conducted using a Modified Absolute Function (MAF), with results further supporting the effectiveness of symmetrical activation functions on performance gains. These findings underscore the importance of selecting proper activation functions that align with the signal characteristics of fNIRS data.",

Thanks to its inverted framework, iTransformer effectively captures multivariate correlation. However, the inverted framework still has some limitations. It diminishes temporal interdependency information, and introduces noise in cases of nonsignificant variable correlation. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel data augmentation method on inverted framework, called DAIF. Unlike previous data augmentation methods, DAIF stands out as the first real-time augmentation specifically designed for the inverted framework in MTS forecasting. We first define the structure of the inverted sequence-to-sequence framework, then propose two different DAIF strategies, Frequency Filtering and Cross-variation Patching to address the existing challenges of the inverted framework. Experiments across multiple datasets and inverted models have demonstrated the effectiveness of our DAIF.",

        "abstract": "Accurate preoperative assessment of lymph node (LN) metastasis in rectal cancer guides treatment decisions, yet conventional MRI evaluation based on morphological criteria shows limited diagnostic performance. While some artificial intelligence models have been developed, they often operate as black boxes, lacking the interpretability needed for clinical trust. Moreover, these models typically evaluate nodes in isolation, overlooking the patient-level context. To address these limitations, we introduce LRMR, an LLM-Driven Relational Multi-node Ranking framework. This approach reframes the diagnostic task from a direct classification problem into a structured reasoning and ranking process. The LRMR framework operates in two stages. First, a multimodal large language model (LLM) analyzes a composite montage image of all LNs from a patient, generating a structured report that details ten distinct radiological features. Second, a text-based LLM performs pairwise comparisons of these reports between different patients, establishing a relative risk ranking based on the severity and number of adverse features. We evaluated our method on a retrospective cohort of 117 rectal cancer patients. LRMR achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.7917 and an F1-score of 0.7200, outperforming a range of deep learning baselines, including ResNet50 (AUC 0.7708). Ablation studies confirmed the value of our two main contributions: removing the relational ranking stage or the structured prompting stage led to a significant performance drop, with AUCs falling to 0.6875 and 0.6458, respectively. Our work demonstrates that decoupling visual perception from cognitive reasoning through a two-stage LLM framework offers a powerful, interpretable, and effective new paradigm for assessing lymph node metastasis in rectal cancer.",

        "abstract": "With advancements in computing and communication technologies, the Internet of Things (IoT) has seen significant growth. IoT devices typically collect data from various sensors, such as temperature, humidity, and energy meters. Much of this data is temporal in nature. Traditionally, data from IoT devices is centralized for analysis, but this approach introduces delays and increased communication costs. Federated learning (FL) has emerged as an effective alternative, allowing for model training across distributed devices without the need to centralize data. In many applications, such as smart home energy and environmental monitoring, the data collected by IoT devices across different locations can exhibit significant variation in trends and seasonal patterns. Accurately forecasting such non-stationary, non-linear time-series data is crucial for applications like energy consumption estimation and weather forecasting. However, these data variations can severely impact prediction accuracy. The key contributions of this paper are: (1) Investigating how non-linear, non-stationary time-series data distributions, like generalized extreme value (gen-extreme) and log norm distributions, affect FL performance. (2) Analyzing how different detrending techniques for non-linear time-series data influence the forecasting model's performance in a FL setup. We generated several synthetic time-series datasets using non-linear data distributions and trained an LSTM-based forecasting model using both centralized and FL approaches. Additionally, we evaluated the impact of detrending on real-world datasets with non-linear time-series data distributions. Our experimental results show that: (1) FL performs worse than centralized approaches when dealing with non-linear data distributions. (2) The use of appropriate detrending techniques improves FL performance, reducing loss across different data distributions.",

Among machine learning approaches, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising framework for tractography, outperforming traditional methods in several key aspects. TractOracle-RL, a recent RL-based approach, reduces false positives by incorporating anatomical priors into the training process via a reward-based mechanism. In this paper, we investigate four extensions of the original TractOracle-RL framework by integrating recent advances in RL, and we evaluate their performance across five diverse diffusion MRI datasets. Results demonstrate that combining an oracle with the RL framework consistently leads to robust and reliable tractography, regardless of the specific method or dataset used. We also introduce a novel RL training scheme called Iterative Reward Training (IRT), inspired by the Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) paradigm. Instead of relying on human input, IRT leverages bundle filtering methods to iteratively refine the oracle's guidance throughout training. Experimental results show that RL methods trained with oracle feedback significantly outperform widely used tractography techniques in terms of accuracy and anatomical validity.",

Wendland RBFs, known for their compact support, smoothness, and positive definiteness in approximation theory, are adapted to address limitations of traditional activation functions like ReLU, sigmoid, and tanh. The proposed enhanced Wendland activation combines a standard Wendland component with linear and exponential terms, offering tunable locality, improved gradient propagation, and enhanced stability during training. Theoretical analysis highlights its mathematical properties, including smoothness and adaptability, while empirical experiments on synthetic tasks (e.g., sine wave approximation) and benchmark datasets (MNIST, Fashion-MNIST) demonstrate competitive performance. Results show that the Wendland-based activation achieves superior accuracy in certain scenarios, particularly in regression tasks, while maintaining computational efficiency. The study bridges classical RBF theory with modern deep learning, suggesting that Wendland activations can mitigate overfitting and improve generalization through localized, smooth transformations.

        "abstract": "Operating Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices is increasingly challenged by limited communication bandwidth and strained computational and memory costs. Thus, cloud-assisted remote fine-tuning becomes indispensable. Nevertheless, existing Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) approaches typically employ fixed or heuristic rank configurations, and the subsequent over-the-air transmission of all LoRA parameters could be rather inefficient. To address this limitation, we develop AirLLM, a hierarchical diffusion policy framework for communication-aware LoRA adaptation. Specifically, AirLLM models the rank configuration as a structured action vector that spans all LoRA-inserted projections. To solve the underlying high-dimensional sequential decision-making problem, a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent generates coarse-grained decisions by jointly observing wireless states and linguistic complexity, which are then refined via Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) to produce high-resolution, task- and channel-adaptive rank vectors. The two modules are optimized alternatively, with the DDIM trained under the Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) paradigm to maintain alignment with PPO rewards. Experiments under varying signal-to-noise ratios demonstrate that AirLLM consistently enhances fine-tuning performance while significantly reducing transmission costs, highlighting the effectiveness of reinforcement-driven, diffusion-refined rank adaptation for scalable and efficient remote fine-tuning over the air.",

In this work, we introduce LangevinFlow, a sequential Variational Auto-Encoder where the time evolution of latent variables is governed by the underdamped Langevin equation. Our approach incorporates physical priors -- such as inertia, damping, a learned potential function, and stochastic forces -- to represent both autonomous and non-autonomous processes in neural systems. Crucially, the potential function is parameterized as a network of locally coupled oscillators, biasing the model toward oscillatory and flow-like behaviors observed in biological neural populations. Our model features a recurrent encoder, a one-layer Transformer decoder, and Langevin dynamics in the latent space. Empirically, our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on synthetic neural populations generated by a Lorenz attractor, closely matching ground-truth firing rates. On the Neural Latents Benchmark (NLB), the model achieves superior held-out neuron likelihoods (bits per spike) and forward prediction accuracy across four challenging datasets. It also matches or surpasses alternative methods in decoding behavioral metrics such as hand velocity. Overall, this work introduces a flexible, physics-inspired, high-performing framework for modeling complex neural population dynamics and their unobserved influences.",

Traditional methods address this by introducing inductive biases to facilitate communication emergence . This study fundamentally questions whether such artificial inductive biases are, in fact, over-engineering. Through experiments with the ``AI Mother Tongue'' (AIM) framework, based on a Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE), we demonstrate that when agents possess an endogenous symbol system, their neural representations naturally exhibit spontaneous semantic compression and Nash equilibrium-driven semantic convergence, achieving effective symbolic communication without external inductive biases. This aligns with recent neuroscience findings suggesting that the human brain does not directly use human language for internal thought , and resonates with research on ``soft thinking'' capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) . Compared to traditional explicit communication methods, AIM demonstrates stronger generality and efficiency. The interpretable analysis toolkit developed in this study confirms that symbol usage exhibits a significant power-law distribution, leading to three major theoretical insights: the ``Neural Communication Hypothesis'', the ``Tool-First Principle'', and the ``Semantic Interpretability Paradigm''. Future research will explore the integration of Hierarchical Quantized Variational Autoencoders (HQ-VAE) to enhance AIM's complex expressive capabilities and investigate the potential for ``Reinforcement Learning (RL) Low-Level Pre-training''.

        "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) increasingly power conversational agents, understanding how they model users' emotional states is critical for ethical deployment. Inspired by emotion wheels -- a psychological framework that argues emotions organize hierarchically -- we analyze probabilistic dependencies between emotional states in model outputs. We find that LLMs naturally form hierarchical emotion trees that align with human psychological models, and larger models develop more complex hierarchies. We also uncover systematic biases in emotion recognition across socioeconomic personas, with compounding misclassifications for intersectional, underrepresented groups. Human studies reveal striking parallels, suggesting that LLMs internalize aspects of social perception. Beyond highlighting emergent emotional reasoning in LLMs, our results hint at the potential of using cognitively-grounded theories for developing better model evaluations.",

        "abstract": "Diffusion MRI (dMRI) tractography is currently the only method for in vivo mapping of the brain's white matter (WM) connections. Tractometry is an advanced tractography analysis technique for along-tract profiling to investigate the morphology and microstructural properties along the fiber tracts. Tractometry has become an essential tool for studying local along-tract differences between different populations (e.g., health vs disease). In this study, we propose a novel atlas-guided fine-scale tractometry method, namely AGFS-Tractometry, that leverages tract spatial information and permutation testing to enhance the along-tract statistical analysis between populations. There are two major contributions in AGFS-Tractometry. First, we create a novel atlas-guided tract profiling template that enables consistent, fine-scale, along-tract parcellation of subject-specific fiber tracts. Second, we propose a novel nonparametric permutation testing group comparison method to enable simultaneous analysis across all along-tract parcels while correcting for multiple comparisons. We perform experimental evaluations on synthetic datasets with known group differences and in vivo real data. We compare AGFS-Tractometry with two state-of-the-art tractometry methods, including Automated Fiber-tract Quantification (AFQ) and BUndle ANalytics (BUAN). Our results show that the proposed AGFS-Tractometry obtains enhanced sensitivity and specificity in detecting local WM differences. In the real data analysis experiments, AGFS-Tractometry can identify more regions with significant differences, which are anatomically consistent with the existing literature. Overall, these demonstrate the ability of AGFS-Tractometry to detect subtle or spatially localized WM group-level differences. The created tract profiling template and related code are available at: this https URL.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces \\textbf{Measure Learning}, a paradigm for modeling ambiguity via non-linear expectations. We define Neural Expectation Operators as solutions to Backward Stochastic Differential Equations (BSDEs) whose drivers are parameterized by neural networks. The main mathematical contribution is a rigorous well-posedness theorem for BSDEs whose drivers satisfy a local Lipschitz condition in the state variable $y$ and quadratic growth in its martingale component $z$. This result circumvents the classical global Lipschitz assumption, is applicable to common neural network architectures (e.g., with ReLU activations), and holds for exponentially integrable terminal data, which is the sharp condition for this setting. Our primary innovation is to build a constructive bridge between the abstract, and often restrictive, assumptions of the deep theory of quadratic BSDEs and the world of machine learning, demonstrating that these conditions can be met by concrete, verifiable neural network designs. We provide constructive methods for enforcing key axiomatic properties, such as convexity, by architectural design. The theory is extended to the analysis of fully coupled Forward-Backward SDE systems and to the asymptotic analysis of large interacting particle systems, for which we establish both a Law of Large Numbers (propagation of chaos) and a Central Limit Theorem. This work provides the foundational mathematical framework for data-driven modeling under ambiguity.",

This paradigm, however, misconstrues the true nature of money laundering, which is rarely anomalous but often deliberate, repeated, and concealed within consistent behavioral routines. In this paper, we challenge the entity-centric approach and propose a network-theoretic perspective that emphasizes detecting predefined laundering patterns across directed transaction networks. We introduce the notion of behavioral consistency as the core trait of laundering activity, and argue that such patterns are better captured through subgraph structures expressing semantic and functional roles - not solely geometry. Crucially, we explore the concept of pattern fragility: the sensitivity of laundering patterns to small attribute changes and, conversely, their semantic robustness even under drastic topological transformations. We claim that laundering detection should not hinge on statistical outliers, but on preservation of behavioral essence, and propose a reconceptualization of pattern similarity grounded in this insight. This philosophical and practical shift has implications for how AML systems model, scan, and interpret networks in the fight against financial crime.",

In this work, we propose a novel approach for identifying anomalies in IoT network traffic by leveraging the Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) and ResNet-18, a deep learning model known for its effectiveness in feature extraction and image-based tasks. Learnable MFCCs enable adaptive spectral feature representation, capturing the temporal patterns inherent in network traffic more effectively than traditional fixed MFCCs. We demonstrate that transforming raw signals into MFCCs maps the data into a higher-dimensional space, enhancing class separability and enabling more effective multiclass classification. Our approach combines the strengths of MFCCs with the robust feature extraction capabilities of ResNet-18, offering a powerful framework for anomaly detection. The proposed model is evaluated on three widely used IoT intrusion detection datasets: CICIoT2023, NSL-KDD, and IoTID20. The experimental results highlight the potential of integrating adaptive signal processing techniques with deep learning architectures to achieve robust and scalable anomaly detection in heterogeneous IoT network landscapes.",

This paper offers a structural diagnosis of such failures, revealing a persistent gap between \\textit{comprehension} and \\textit{competence}. Through controlled experiments and architectural analysis, we demonstrate that LLMs often articulate correct principles without reliably applying them--a failure rooted not in knowledge access, but in computational execution. We term this phenomenon the computational \\textit{split-brain syndrome}, where instruction and action pathways are geometrically and functionally dissociated. This core limitation recurs across domains, from mathematical operations to relational inferences, and explains why model behavior remains brittle even under idealized prompting. We argue that LLMs function as powerful pattern completion engines, but lack the architectural scaffolding for principled, compositional reasoning. Our findings delineate the boundary of current LLM capabilities and motivate future models with metacognitive control, principle lifting, and structurally grounded execution. This diagnosis also clarifies why mechanistic interpretability findings may reflect training-specific pattern coordination rather than universal computational principles, and why the geometric separation between instruction and execution pathways suggests limitations in neural introspection and mechanistic analysis.",

        "abstract": "Massive MIMO systems are moving toward increased numbers of radio frequency chains, higher carrier frequencies and larger bandwidths. As such, digital-to-analog converters (DACs) are becoming a bottleneck in terms of hardware complexity and power consumption. In this work, non-linear precoding for coarsely quantized downlink massive MIMO is studied. Given the NP-hard nature of this problem, a graph neural network (GNN) is proposed that directly outputs the precoded quantized vector based on the channel matrix and the intended transmit symbols. The model is trained in a self-supervised manner, by directly maximizing the achievable rate. To overcome the non-differentiability of the objective function, introduced due to the non-differentiable DAC functions, a straight-through Gumbel-softmax estimation of the gradient is proposed. The proposed method achieves a significant increase in achievable sum rate under coarse quantization. For instance, in the single-user case, the proposed method can achieve the same sum rate as maximum ratio transmission (MRT) by using one-bit DAC's as compared to 3 bits for MRT. This reduces the DAC's power consumption by a factor 4-7 and 3 for baseband and RF DACs respectively. This, however, comes at the cost of increased digital signal processing power consumption. When accounting for this, the reduction in overall power consumption holds for a system bandwidth up to 3.5 MHz for baseband DACs, while the RF DACs can maintain a power reduction of 2.9 for higher bandwidths. Notably, indirect effects, which further reduce the power consumption, such as a reduced fronthaul consumption and reduction in other components, are not considered in this analysis.",

A shared aspect is, for instance, their vulnerability to adversarial inputs, small perturbations that can lead to incorrect predictions. While formal verification techniques have been extensively developed for classical models, no comparable framework exists for certifying the robustness of VQCs. Here, we present the first in-depth theoretical and practical study of the formal verification problem for VQCs. Inspired by abstract interpretation methods used in deep learning, we analyze the applicability and limitations of interval-based reachability techniques in the quantum setting. We show that quantum-specific aspects, such as state normalization, introduce inter-variable dependencies that challenge existing approaches. We investigate these issues by introducing a novel semantic framework based on abstract interpretation, where the verification problem for VQCs can be formally defined, and its complexity analyzed. Finally, we demonstrate our approach on standard verification benchmarks.",

        "abstract": "The widespread use of social media applications has raised significant privacy concerns, often highlighted in user reviews. These reviews also provide developers with valuable insights into improving apps by addressing issues and introducing better features. However, the sheer volume and nuanced nature of reviews make manual identification and prioritization of privacy-related concerns challenging for developers. Previous studies have developed software utilities to automatically classify user reviews as privacy-relevant, privacy-irrelevant, bug reports, feature requests, etc., using machine learning. Notably, there is a lack of focus on classifying reviews specifically as privacy-related feature requests, privacy-related bug reports, or privacy-irrelevant. This paper introduces SENtinel SORt (SENSOR), an automated online annotation tool designed to help developers annotate and classify user reviews into these categories. For automating the annotation of such reviews, this paper introduces the annotation model, GRACE (GRU-based Attention with CBOW Embedding), using Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) with Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) and Attention mechanism. Approximately 16000 user reviews from seven popular social media apps on Google Play Store, including Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp, Snapchat, X (formerly Twitter), Facebook Lite, and Line were analyzed. Two annotators manually labelled the reviews, achieving a Cohen's Kappa value of 0.87, ensuring a labeled dataset with high inter-rater agreement for training machine learning models. Among the models tested, GRACE demonstrated the best performance (macro F1-score: 0.9434, macro ROC-AUC: 0.9934, and accuracy: 95.10%) despite class imbalance. SENSOR demonstrates significant potential to assist developers with extracting and addressing privacy-related feature requests or bug reports from user reviews, enhancing user privacy and trust.",

This property enables alignment with task-specific goals, especially in post-hoc settings lacking ground-truth explanations.

This procedure gives a metric on simplices which we refer to as the largest angle path distance (LAPD). We analyze the properties of LAPD under random sampling, and prove that with an appropriate denoising procedure, this metric separates the manifold components with high probability. We validate the proposed methodology with extensive numerical experiments on both synthetic and real-world data sets. These experiments demonstrate that the method is robust to noise, curvature, and small intersection angle, and generally out-performs other MMC algorithms.

        "abstract": "Spectroscopic anomaly detection and isotope identification algorithms are integral components in nuclear nonproliferation applications such as search operations. The task is especially challenging in the case of mobile detector systems due to the fact that the observed gamma-ray background changes more than for a static detector system, and a pretrained background model can easily find itself out of domain. The result is that algorithms may exceed their intended false alarm rate, or sacrifice detection sensitivity in order to maintain the desired false alarm rate. Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has been shown to be a powerful tool for spectral anomaly detection and identification, but, like many similar algorithms that rely on data-driven background models, in its conventional implementation it is unable to update in real time to account for environmental changes that affect the background spectroscopic signature. We have developed a novel NMF-based algorithm that periodically updates its background model to accommodate changing environmental conditions. The Adaptive NMF algorithm involves fewer assumptions about its environment, making it more generalizable than existing NMF-based methods while maintaining or exceeding detection performance on simulated and real-world datasets.",

However, existing approaches rely heavily on manual annotation or predefined relationship taxonomies. We propose EDR-MQ (Extracting Document Relations by Marginalizing over User Queries), a novel framework that discovers document relationships through query marginalization. EDR-MQ is based on the insight that strongly related documents often co-occur in results across diverse user queries, enabling us to estimate joint probabilities between document pairs by marginalizing over a collection of queries. To enable this query marginalization approach, we develop Multiply Conditioned Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MC-RAG), which employs conditional retrieval where subsequent document retrievals depend on previously retrieved content. By observing co-occurrence patterns across diverse queries, EDR-MQ estimates joint probabilities between document pairs without requiring labeled training data or predefined taxonomies. Experimental results show that our query marginalization approach successfully identifies meaningful document relationships, revealing topical clusters, evidence chains, and cross-domain connections that are not apparent through traditional similarity-based methods. Our query-driven framework offers a practical approach to document organization that adapts to different user perspectives and information needs.",

Adult service websites (ASWs) have and continue to be linked to sex trafficking, offering a platform for traffickers to advertise their victims. Thus, organizations involved in the fight against sex trafficking often use ASW data when attempting to identify potential sex trafficking victims. A critical challenge in transforming ASW data into actionable insight is text analysis. Previous research using ASW data has shown that ASW ad text is important for linking ads. However, working with this text is challenging due to its extensive use of emojis, poor grammar, and deliberate obfuscation to evade law enforcement scrutiny. We conduct a comprehensive study of language modeling approaches for this application area, including simple information retrieval methods, pre-trained transformers, and custom transformer models. We demonstrate that characteristics of ASW text data allow efficient custom transformer models to be trained with relatively small GPU resources and used efficiently for inference on consumer hardware. Our custom models outperform fine-tuned variants of well-known encoder-only transformer models, including BERT-base, RoBERTa, and ModernBERT, on accuracy, recall, F1 score, and ROC AUC. We demonstrate the use of our best-performing custom configuration on three tasks related to ASW data analysis: (i) decomposing the giant component in a graph representation of ASW data, (ii) clustering ASW ad text, and (iii) using the learned token embeddings to understand the use of emojis in the illicit context we study. The models we develop represent a significant advancement in ASW text analysis, which can be leveraged in a variety of downstream applications and research.",

The chosen models demonstrated great performance to model temporal patterns and detect feature significance. The observed performance are mainly due to the fact that IoT system traffic patterns are both sequential and diverse, leaving a rich set of temporal patterns for the models to learn. Experimental results showed that BERT maintained the best performance. It achieved 99.94% accuracy rate alongside high precision and recall, F1-score and AUC-ROC score of 99.99% which demonstrates its capabilities through temporal dependency capture. The Multi-Head Attention offered promising results by providing good detection capabilities with interpretable results. On the other side, the Multi-Head Attention model required significant processing time like BI-LSTM variants. The GraphSAGE model achieved good accuracy while requiring the shortest training time but yielded the lowest accuracy, precision, and F1 score compared to the other models",

Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) is a widely used method for visual explanations, yet it typically focuses on the final convolutional layer or naïvely averages across layers, strategies that can obscure important semantic cues or amplify irrelevant noise. We propose Winsor-CAM, a novel, human-tunable extension of Grad-CAM that generates robust and coherent saliency maps by aggregating information across all convolutional layers. To mitigate the influence of noisy or extreme attribution values, Winsor-CAM applies Winsorization, a percentile-based outlier attenuation technique. A user-controllable threshold allows for semantic-level tuning, enabling flexible exploration of model behavior across representational hierarchies. Evaluations on standard architectures (ResNet50, DenseNet121, VGG16, InceptionV3) using the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset demonstrate that Winsor-CAM produces more interpretable heatmaps and achieves superior performance in localization metrics, including intersection-over-union and center-of-mass alignment, when compared to Grad-CAM and uniform layer-averaging baselines. Winsor-CAM advances the goal of trustworthy AI by offering interpretable, multi-layer insights with human-in-the-loop control.",

As part of the global strategy to reduce carbon emissions within the broader context of a green-energy transition, there has been growing interest in exploiting enhanced geothermal systems. Tested in the complex geothermal area of Iceland's Hengill region using open-access data from a temporary experiment, our model was trained and validated using both manually revised and automatic seismic catalogs. Results showed a significant increase in event detection compared to previously published automatic systems and reference catalogs, including a $4 M_w$ seismic sequence in December 2018 and a single-day sequence in February 2019. Our method reduces false events, minimizes manual oversight, and decreases the need for extensive tuning of pipelines or transfer learning of deep-learning models. Overall, it validates a robust monitoring tool for geothermal seismic regions, complementing existing systems and enhancing operational risk mitigation during geothermal energy exploitation.",

While machine learning has been effective in real-time detection of phishing attacks, progress is hindered by lack of large, high-quality datasets and benchmarks. In addition to poor-quality due to challenges in data collection, existing datasets suffer from leakage and unrealistic base rates, leading to overly optimistic performance results. In this paper, we introduce PhreshPhish, a large-scale, high-quality dataset of phishing websites that addresses these limitations. Compared to existing public datasets, PhreshPhish is substantially larger and provides significantly higher quality, as measured by the estimated rate of invalid or mislabeled data points. Additionally, we propose a comprehensive suite of benchmark datasets specifically designed for realistic model evaluation by minimizing leakage, increasing task difficulty, enhancing dataset diversity, and adjustment of base rates more likely to be seen in the real world. We train and evaluate multiple solution approaches to provide baseline performance on the benchmark sets. We believe the availability of this dataset and benchmarks will enable realistic, standardized model comparison and foster further advances in phishing detection.

These models have reached accuracy levels comparable to traditional NWP systems, marking a significant milestone in data-driven weather prediction.

In this study, we introduce a modernized CNN-based model for global weather forecasting that delivers competitive accuracy while significantly reducing computational requirements. To present a systematic modernization roadmap, we highlight key architectural enhancements across multiple design scales from an earlier CNN-based approach. KAI-a incorporates a scale-invariant architecture and InceptionNeXt-based blocks within a geophysically-aware design, tailored to the structure of Earth system data. Trained on the ERA5 daily dataset with 67 atmospheric variables, the model contains about 7 million parameters and completes training in just 12 hours on a single NVIDIA L40s GPU. Our evaluation shows that KAI-a matches the performance of state-of-the-art models in medium-range weather forecasting, while offering a significantly lightweight design. Furthermore, case studies on the 2018 European heatwave and the East Asian summer monsoon demonstrate KAI-a's robust skill in capturing extreme events, reinforcing its practical utility.",

To mitigate TsDLI and enhance model generalization and explainability, we propose two novel regularization strategies: Local Variation Loss (LVL) and Local-Global Consistency Loss (LGCL). Both methods incorporate classical mathematical principles--specifically, functions of bounded variation and commute-time distances--within a graph theoretic framework. Complementing our regularizers, we introduce a suite of new evaluation metrics that better capture the alignment between temporally local predictions and their associated global emotion labels. We validate our approach through comprehensive experiments on two widely used EEG emotion datasets, DREAMER and DEAP, across a range of neural architectures including LSTM and transformer-based models. Performance is assessed using five distinct metrics encompassing both quantitative accuracy and qualitative consistency. Results consistently show that our proposed methods outperform state-of-the-art baselines, delivering superior aggregate performance and offering a principled trade-off between interpretability and predictive power under label inconsistency. Notably, LVL achieves the best aggregate rank across all benchmarked backbones and metrics, while LGCL frequently ranks the second, highlighting the effectiveness of our framework.",

        "abstract": "Effective management of Service Function Chains (SFCs) and optimal Virtual Network Function (VNF) placement are critical challenges in modern Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) environments. Although Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is widely adopted for dynamic network decision-making, its inherent dependency on structured data and fixed action rules often limits adaptability and responsiveness, particularly under unpredictable network conditions. This paper introduces LiLM-RDB-SFC, a novel approach combining Lightweight Language Model (LiLM) with Relational Database (RDB) to answer network state queries to guide DRL model for efficient SFC provisioning. Our proposed approach leverages two LiLMs, Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers (BART) and the Fine-tuned Language Net T5 (FLAN-T5), to interpret network data and support diverse query types related to SFC demands, data center resources, and VNF availability. Results demonstrate that FLAN-T5 outperforms BART with a lower test loss (0.00161 compared to 0.00734), higher accuracy (94.79% compared to 80.2%), and less processing time (2h 2min compared to 2h 38min). Moreover, when compared to the large language model SQLCoder, FLAN-T5 matches the accuracy of SQLCoder while cutting processing time by 96% (SQLCoder: 54 h 43 min; FLAN-T5: 2 h 2 min).",

The reward is derived from knowledge in the domain of image processing, approximating contours on a two-dimensional field. By modeling obstacles as maxima on the field, collisions are inherently avoided as contours never go through peaks or intersect. Additionally, counters are smooth and energy-efficient. Our framework enables training with large swarm sizes as the agent interaction is minimized and the need for complex credit assignment schemes or observation sharing mechanisms in state-of-the-art MARL approaches are eliminated. Moreover, UAVs obtain the ability to adapt to complex environments where contours may be non-viable or non-existent through intensive training.

Although numerous error detection algorithms have been proposed, the lack of diverse, real-world error datasets limits comprehensive evaluation. Manual error annotation is both time-consuming and inconsistent, motivating the exploration of synthetic error generation as an alternative. In this work, we introduce TableEG, a framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate authentic errors. By employing a table fine-tuning strategy and a triplet representation $(I, T, O)$ to model error generation, detection, and correction tasks, TableEG captures the complex dependencies inherent in two-dimensional tables. Trained on 12 real-world datasets spanning 10 diverse domains, TableEG ensures that the synthesized errors faithfully reflect authentic error distributions. Experimental results indicate that errors generated by TableEG exhibit superior pattern and distribution similarity compared to both rule-based methods and LLM-generated errors without fine-tuning. Furthermore, performance metrics on TableEG-generated errors closely align with those on real-world errors across nearly all datasets and detection algorithms, particularly for machine learning based detection techniques. Overall, TableEG not only bridges the gap between synthetic and real-world errors but also establishes a robust benchmark for subsequent error detection and correction tasks.",

However, most existing works assume a phrase and focus on the attack's effectiveness, offering limited understanding of trigger mechanisms and how multiple triggers interact within the model. In this paper, we present a framework for studying poisoning in LLMs. We show that multiple distinct backdoor triggers can coexist within a single model without interfering with each other, enabling adversaries to embed several triggers concurrently. Using multiple triggers with high embedding similarity, we demonstrate that poisoned triggers can achieve robust activation even when tokens are substituted or separated by long token spans. Our findings expose a broader and more persistent vulnerability surface in LLMs. To mitigate this threat, we propose a post hoc recovery method that selectively retrains specific model components based on a layer-wise weight difference analysis. Our method effectively removes the trigger behaviour with minimal parameter updates, presenting a practical and efficient defence against multi-trigger poisoning.",

To address these challenges, we propose a general framework, MMOne, to represent multiple modalities in one scene, which can be readily extended to additional modalities. Specifically, a modality modeling module with a novel modality indicator is proposed to capture the unique properties of each modality. Additionally, we design a multimodal decomposition mechanism to separate multi-modal Gaussians into single-modal Gaussians based on modality differences. We address the essential distinctions among modalities by disentangling multimodal information into shared and modality-specific components, resulting in a more compact and efficient multimodal scene representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently enhances the representation capability for each modality and is scalable to additional modalities.

We propose Bayesian Tensor Network Kernel Machines, a fully probabilistic framework that uses sparsity-inducing hierarchical priors on TN factors to automatically infer model complexity. This enables automatic inference of tensor rank and feature dimensions, while also identifying the most relevant features for prediction, thereby enhancing model interpretability. All the model parameters and hyperparameters are treated as latent variables with corresponding priors. Given the Bayesian approach and latent variable dependencies, we apply a mean-field variational inference to approximate their posteriors. We show that applying a mean-field approximation to TN factors yields a Bayesian ALS algorithm with the same computational complexity as its deterministic counterpart, enabling uncertainty quantification at no extra computational cost.

This design cleverly intertwines the embedding parameters with the hashed watermark, providing a robust defense against both forging and overwriting attacks. An average pooling is also incorporated to resist fine-tuning and pruning attacks. Furthermore, it can be seamlessly integrated into various neural network architectures, ensuring broad applicability. Theoretically, we analyze its security boundary.

However, automatically observing landslide is challenging due to the extremely large observing area and the rugged topography such as mountain or highland. This motivates us to propose an end-to-end deep-learning-based model which explores the remote sensing images for automatically observing landslide events. By considering remote sensing images as the input data, we can obtain free resource, observe large and rough terrains by time. To explore the remote sensing images, we proposed a novel neural network architecture which is for two tasks of landslide detection and landslide segmentation. We evaluated our proposed model on three different benchmark datasets of LandSlide4Sense, Bijie, and Nepal. By conducting extensive experiments, we achieve F1 scores of 98.23, 93.83 for the landslide detection task on LandSlide4Sense, Bijie datasets; mIoU scores of 63.74, 76.88 on the segmentation tasks regarding LandSlide4Sense, Nepal datasets.

        "abstract": "In recent years, contrastive learning has achieved state-of-the-art performance in the territory of self-supervised representation learning. Many previous works have attempted to provide the theoretical understanding underlying the success of contrastive learning. Almost all of them rely on a default assumption, i.e., the label consistency assumption, which may not hold in practice (the probability of failure is called labeling error) due to the strength and randomness of common augmentation strategies, such as random resized crop (RRC). This paper investigates the theoretical impact of labeling error on the downstream classification performance of contrastive learning. We first reveal several significant negative impacts of labeling error on downstream classification risk. To mitigate these impacts, data dimensionality reduction method (e.g., singular value decomposition, SVD) is applied on original data to reduce false positive samples, and establish both theoretical and empirical evaluations. Moreover, it is also found that SVD acts as a double-edged sword, which may lead to the deterioration of downstream classification accuracy due to the reduced connectivity of the augmentation graph. Based on the above observations, we give the augmentation suggestion that we should use some moderate embedding dimension (such as $512, 1024$ in our experiments), data inflation, weak augmentation, and SVD to ensure large graph connectivity and small labeling error to improve model performance.",

The study presented in this work makes use of machine learning techniques to predict channel quality in a Wi-Fi network in terms of the frame delivery ratio. Predictions can be used proactively to adjust communication parameters at runtime and optimize network operations for industrial applications. Methods including convolutional neural networks and long short-term memory were analyzed on datasets acquired from a real Wi-Fi setup across multiple channels. The models were compared in terms of prediction accuracy and computational complexity. Results show that the frame delivery ratio can be reliably predicted, and convolutional neural networks, although slightly less effective than other models, are more efficient in terms of CPU usage and memory consumption. This enhances the model's usability on embedded and industrial systems.",

This study addresses this issue by proposing a surrogate-based, data-driven methodology for optimizing complex real-world manufacturing systems using only historical process data. Machine learning models are employed to approximate system behavior and construct surrogate models, which are integrated into a tailored metaheuristic approach: Data-Driven Differential Evolution with Multi-Level Penalty Functions and Surrogate Models, an adapted version of Differential Evolution suited to the characteristics of the studied process. The methodology is applied to an extrusion process in the tire manufacturing industry, with the goal of optimizing initialization parameters to reduce waste and production time. Results show that the surrogate-based optimization approach outperforms historical best configurations, achieving a 65\\% reduction in initialization and setup time, while also significantly minimizing material waste.

Traditional Bayesian inference methods, particularly Markov chain Monte Carlo, face significant computational challenges when dealing with the high-dimensional parameter spaces and complex noise characteristics inherent in gravitational wave data. This review examines the emerging role of simulation-based inference methods in gravitational wave astronomy, with a focus on approaches that leverage machine-learning techniques such as normalizing flows and neural posterior estimation. We provide a comprehensive overview of the theoretical foundations underlying various simulation-based inference methods, including neural posterior estimation, neural ratio estimation, neural likelihood estimation, flow matching, and consistency models. We explore the applications of these methods across diverse gravitational wave data processing scenarios, from single-source parameter estimation and overlapping signal analysis to testing general relativity and conducting population studies. Although these techniques demonstrate speed improvements over traditional methods in controlled studies, their model-dependent nature and sensitivity to prior assumptions are barriers to their widespread adoption. Their accuracy, which is similar to that of conventional methods, requires further validation across broader parameter spaces and noise conditions.",

While existing methods attempt to address various incomplete multimodal scenarios by balancing the training of each modality combination through additional gradients, these approaches face a critical limitation: training gradients from different modality combinations conflict with each other, ultimately degrading the performance of the final prediction model. In this paper, we propose a unimodal decoupled dynamic low-rank adaptation method based on modality combinations, named MCULoRA, which is a novel framework for the parameter-efficient training of incomplete multimodal learning models. MCULoRA consists of two key modules, modality combination aware low-rank adaptation (MCLA) and dynamic parameter fine-tuning (DPFT). The MCLA module effectively decouples the shared information from the distinct characteristics of individual modality combinations. The DPFT module adjusts the training ratio of modality combinations based on the separability of each modality's representation space, optimizing the learning efficiency across different modality combinations. Our extensive experimental evaluation in multiple benchmark datasets demonstrates that MCULoRA substantially outperforms previous incomplete multimodal learning approaches in downstream task accuracy.",

Recent KG reasoning methods that integrate both global and local information have achieved promising results. However, existing methods often suffer from score over-smoothing, which blurs the distinction between correct and incorrect answers and hinders reasoning effectiveness. To address this, we propose DuetGraph, a coarse-to-fine KG reasoning mechanism with dual-pathway global-local fusion. DuetGraph tackles over-smoothing by segregating -- rather than stacking -- the processing of local (via message passing) and global (via attention) information into two distinct pathways, preventing mutual interference and preserving representational discrimination. In addition, DuetGraph introduces a coarse-to-fine optimization, which partitions entities into high- and low-score subsets. This strategy narrows the candidate space and sharpens the score gap between the two subsets, which alleviates over-smoothing and enhances inference quality. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate that DuetGraph achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, with up to an 8.7% improvement in reasoning quality and a 1.8$\\times$ acceleration in training efficiency.",

        "abstract": "We study the problem of sampling from a distribution $\\mu$ with density $\\propto e^{-V}$ for some potential function $V:\\mathbb R^d\\to \\mathbb R$ with query access to $V$ and $\\nabla V$. We start with the following standard assumptions: (1) The potential function $V$ is $L$-smooth. (2) The second moment $\\mathbf{E}_{X\\sim \\mu}[\\|X\\|^2]\\leq M$. Recently, He and Zhang (COLT'25) showed that the query complexity of sampling from such distributions is at least $\\left(\\frac{LM}{d\\epsilon}\\right)^{\\Omega(d)}$ where $\\epsilon$ is the desired accuracy in total variation distance, and the Poincaré constant can be arbitrarily large. Meanwhile, another common assumption in the study of diffusion based samplers (see e.g., the work of Chen, Chewi, Li, Li, Salim and Zhang (ICLR'23)) strengthens the smoothness condition (1) to the following: (1*) The potential function of *every* distribution along the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process starting from $\\mu$ is $L$-smooth. We show that under the assumptions (1*) and (2), the query complexity of sampling from $\\mu$ can be $\\mathrm{poly}(L,d)\\cdot \\left(\\frac{Ld+M}{\\epsilon^2}\\right)^{\\mathcal{O}(L+1)}$, which is polynomial in $d$ and $\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}$ when $L=\\mathcal{O}(1)$ and $M=\\mathrm{poly}(d)$. This improves the algorithm with quasi-polynomial query complexity developed by Huang et al. (COLT'24). Our results imply that the seemly moderate strengthening of the smoothness condition (1) to (1*) can lead to an exponential gap in the query complexity of sampling algorithms. Moreover, we show that together with the assumption (1*) and the stronger moment assumption that $\\|X\\|$ is $\\lambda$-sub-Gaussian for $X\\sim\\mu$, the Poincaré constant of $\\mu$ is at most $\\mathcal{O}(\\lambda)^{2(L+1)}$. As an application of our technique, we obtain improved estimate of the Poincaré constant for mixture of Gaussians with the same covariance.",

However, when sensitive attributes such as skin color are continuous, dividing into default groups may overlook or obscure the discrimination experienced by certain minority subpopulations. To address this limitation, we propose a fairness-based grouping approach for continuous (possibly multidimensional) sensitive attributes. By grouping data according to observed levels of discrimination, our method identifies the partition that maximizes a novel criterion based on inter-group variance in discrimination, thereby isolating the most critical subgroups. We validate the proposed approach using multiple synthetic datasets and demonstrate its robustness under changing population distributions - revealing how discrimination is manifested within the space of sensitive attributes. Furthermore, we examine a specialized setting of monotonic fairness for the case of skin color. Our empirical results on both CelebA and FFHQ, leveraging the skin tone as predicted by an industrial proprietary algorithm, show that the proposed segmentation uncovers more nuanced patterns of discrimination than previously reported, and that these findings remain stable across datasets for a given model. Finally, we leverage our grouping model for debiasing purpose, aiming at predicting fair scores with group-by-group post-processing. The results demonstrate that our approach improves fairness while having minimal impact on accuracy, thus confirming our partition method and opening the door for industrial deployment.",

To consistently control values without sacrificing model performance, we introduce a gated value vector activation method for effective and minimum degree of value control.

Specifically, utilizing sparse/incomplete measured data, a time-dependent optimization problem is formulated for determining the expansion coefficients of an associated low-dimensional representation of the stochastic wind field. Compared to an alternative, standard, compressive sampling treatment of the problem, the developed methodology exhibits the following advantages. First, the Bayesian formulation enables also the quantification of the uncertainty in the estimates. Second, the requirement in standard CS-based applications for an a priori selection of the expansion basis is circumvented. Instead, this is done herein in an adaptive manner based on the acquired data. Overall, the methodology exhibits enhanced extrapolation accuracy, even in cases of high-dimensional data of arbitrary form, and of relatively large extrapolation distances. Thus, it can be used, potentially, in a wide range of wind engineering applications where various constraints dictate the use of a limited number of sensors. The efficacy of the methodology is demonstrated by considering two case studies. The first relates to the extrapolation of simulated wind velocity records consistent with a prescribed joint wavenumber-frequency power spectral density in a three-dimensional domain (2D and time). The second pertains to the extrapolation of four-dimensional (3D and time) boundary layer wind tunnel experimental data that exhibit significant spatial variability and non-Gaussian characteristics.",

        "abstract": "The application of convolutional autoencoder deep learning to imaging data for planetary science and astrobiological use is briefly reviewed and explored with a focus on the need to understand algorithmic rationale, process, and results when machine learning is utilized. Successful autoencoders train to build a model that captures the features of data in a dimensionally reduced form (the latent representation) that can then be used to recreate the original input. One application is the reconstruction of incomplete or noisy data. Here a baseline, lightweight convolutional autoencoder is used to examine the utility for planetary image reconstruction or inpainting in situations where there is destructive random noise (i.e., either luminance noise with zero returned data in some image pixels, or color noise with random additive levels across pixel channels). It is shown that, in certain use cases, multi-color image reconstruction can be usefully applied even with extensive random destructive noise with 90% areal coverage and higher. This capability is discussed in the context of intentional masking to reduce data bandwidth, or situations with low-illumination levels and other factors that obscure image data (e.g., sensor degradation or atmospheric conditions). It is further suggested that for some scientific use cases the model latent space and representations have more utility than large raw imaging datasets.",

        "abstract": "Efficient entanglement strategies are essential for advancing variational quantum circuits (VQCs) for quantum machine learning (QML). However, most current approaches use fixed entanglement topologies that are not adaptive to task requirements, limiting potential gains over classical models. We introduce a novel stochastic entanglement configuration method that systematically generates diverse entanglement topologies to identify a subspace of constructive entanglement configurations, defined as entanglement topologies that boost hybrid model performance (e.g., classification accuracy) beyond classical baselines. Each configuration is encoded as a stochastic binary matrix, denoting directed entanglement between qubits. This enables scalable exploration of the hyperspace of candidate entanglement topologies using entanglement density and per-qubit constraints as key metrics. We define unconstrained and constrained sampling modes, controlling entanglement per qubit. Using our method, 400 stochastic configurations were generated and evaluated in a hybrid QML for cardiac MRI disease classification. We identified 64 (16%) novel constructive entanglement configurations that consistently outperformed the classical baseline. Ensemble aggregation of top-performing configurations achieved ~0.92 classification accuracy, exceeding the classical model (~0.87) by over 5%. Compared to four conventional topologies (ring, nearest neighbor, no entanglement, fully entangled), none surpassed the classical baseline (maximum accuracy ~0.82), while our configurations delivered up to ~20% higher accuracy. Thus, highlighting the robustness and generalizability of the identified constructive entanglements.",

However, a large subset of the community still uses encoder-only models for tasks such as classification or retrieval. Previous work has attempted to compare these architectures, but is forced to make comparisons with models that have different numbers of parameters, training techniques, and datasets. We introduce the SOTA open-data Ettin suite of models: paired encoder-only and decoder-only models ranging from 17 million parameters to 1 billion, trained on up to 2 trillion tokens. Using the same recipe for both encoder-only and decoder-only models produces SOTA recipes in both categories for their respective sizes, beating ModernBERT as an encoder and Llama 3.2 and SmolLM2 as decoders. Like previous work, we find that encoder-only models excel at classification and retrieval tasks while decoders excel at generative tasks. However, we show that adapting a decoder model to encoder tasks (and vice versa) through continued training is subpar compared to using only the reverse objective (i.e. a 400M encoder outperforms a 1B decoder on MNLI, and vice versa for generative tasks). We open-source all artifacts of this study including training data, training order segmented by checkpoint, and 200+ checkpoints to allow future work to analyze or extend all aspects of training.",

However, no-regret learning is impossible when budget balance has to be enforced at each time step. Bernasconi et al. [Ber+24] show how this impossibility can be circumvented by relaxing the budget balance constraint to hold only globally over all time steps. In particular, they design an algorithm achieving regret of the order of $\\tilde O(T^{3/4})$ and provide a lower bound of $\\Omega(T^{5/7})$. In this work, we interpolate between these two extremes by studying how the optimal regret rate varies with the allowed violation of the global budget balance constraint. Specifically, we design an algorithm that, by violating the constraint by at most $T^{\\beta}$ for any given $\\beta \\in [\\frac{3}{4}, \\frac{6}{7}]$, attains regret $\\tilde O(T^{1 - \\beta/3})$. We complement this result with a matching lower bound, thus fully characterizing the trade-off between regret and budget violation. Our results show that both the $\\tilde O(T^{3/4})$ upper bound in the global budget balance case and the $\\Omega(T^{5/7})$ lower bound under unconstrained budget balance violation obtained by Bernasconi et al.

Its easy to use interface allows users to specify customized FL requirements through job configuration, which supports: (a) customized data distributions, ranging from non-independent and identically distributed (non-iid) data to independent and identically distributed (iid) data, (b) selection of local learning algorithms according to user preferences, with complete agnosticism to ML libraries, (c) choice of network topology illustrating communication patterns among nodes, (d) definition of model aggregation and consensus algorithms, and (e) pluggable blockchain support for enhanced robustness. Through a series of experimental evaluations, we demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of FLsim in simulating a diverse range of state-of-the-art FL experiments.

Similarly, differentially private (DP) adaptations-ones that aim to preserve privacy of the adaptation data-have been extensively studied for DMs, while VAR lacks such solutions. In our work, we implement and benchmark many strategies for VAR, and compare them to state-of-the-art DM adaptation strategies.

Addressing the region's unique multilingual environment (Cantonese, Mandarin, and English), its distinct socio-legal context under the \"one country, two systems\" framework, and specific local cultural and value considerations, the model is built upon the DeepSeek architecture and systematically aligned with regional norms through a multifaceted full parameter fine-tuning process. It is further integrated with a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system to ensure timely and factually grounded information access. The core contribution lies in the design and implementation of a comprehensive, region-specific AI alignment and safety framework, demonstrated through two key achievements: 1) The successful development of HKGAI-V1 itself - which outper-forms general-purpose models in handling Hong Kong-specific culturally sensitive queries, and embodies a \"governance-embedded\" approach to digital sovereignty - empowers Hong Kong to exercise control over AI applications in critical sectors including public services, legal systems, and edu-cation. 2) The development of the proprietary Adversarial HK Value Benchmark, a rigorous tool for evaluating model alignment with local ethical and legal stand-ards under challenging conditions. By documenting these achievements, the paper provides not only a technological artifact but also a replicable blueprint for developing advanced, regionally focused AI systems deeply rooted in their local identities.",

However, it is not easy to explore the efficiency of these inter-core connected AI (ICCA) chips, due to a fundamental tussle among compute (per-core execution), communication (inter-core data exchange), and I/O (off-chip data access). In this paper, we develop Elk, a DL compiler framework to maximize the efficiency of ICCA chips by jointly trading off all the three performance factors discussed above. Elk structures these performance factors into configurable parameters and forms a global trade-off space in the DL compiler. To systematically explore this space and maximize overall efficiency, Elk employs a new inductive operator scheduling policy and a cost-aware on-chip memory allocation algorithm. It generates globally optimized execution plans that best overlap off-chip data loading and on-chip execution. To examine the efficiency of Elk, we build a full-fledged emulator based on a real ICCA chip IPU-POD4, and an ICCA chip simulator for sensitivity analysis with different interconnect network topologies. Elk achieves 94% of the ideal roofline performance of ICCA chips on average, showing the benefits of supporting large DL models on ICCA chips. We also show Elk's capability of enabling architecture design space exploration for new ICCA chip development.",

We solve this problem by embedding canonical forms of LTI systems within the Bayesian framework. We rigorously establish that inference in these minimal parameterizations fully captures all invariant system dynamics (e.g., transfer functions, eigenvalues, predictive distributions of system outputs) while resolving identifiability. This approach unlocks the use of meaningful, structure-aware priors (e.g., enforcing stability via eigenvalues) and ensures conditions for a Bernstein--von Mises theorem -- a link between Bayesian and frequentist large-sample asymptotics that is broken in standard forms. Extensive simulations with modern MCMC methods highlight advantages over standard parameterizations: canonical forms achieve higher computational efficiency, generate interpretable and well-behaved posteriors, and provide robust uncertainty estimates, particularly from limited data.",

        "abstract": "Perceiving and reconstructing 4D spatial-temporal geometry from videos is a fundamental yet challenging computer vision task. To facilitate interactive and real-time applications, we propose a streaming 4D visual geometry transformer that shares a similar philosophy with autoregressive large language models. We explore a simple and efficient design and employ a causal transformer architecture to process the input sequence in an online manner. We use temporal causal attention and cache the historical keys and values as implicit memory to enable efficient streaming long-term 4D reconstruction. This design can handle real-time 4D reconstruction by incrementally integrating historical information while maintaining high-quality spatial consistency. For efficient training, we propose to distill knowledge from the dense bidirectional visual geometry grounded transformer (VGGT) to our causal model. For inference, our model supports the migration of optimized efficient attention operator (e.g., FlashAttention) from the field of large language models. Extensive experiments on various 4D geometry perception benchmarks demonstrate that our model increases the inference speed in online scenarios while maintaining competitive performance, paving the way for scalable and interactive 4D vision systems.
