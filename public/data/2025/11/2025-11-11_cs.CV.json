This challenge is especially evident in medical imaging, where domain shifts can degrade both performance and transparency. In this paper, we introduce Randomized-MLP (RMLP) regularization, a contrastive learning-based method that encourages more semantically aligned representations. We use RMLPs when fine-tuning DINOv2 to both medical and natural image modalities, showing that it improves or maintains downstream performance while producing more interpretable attention maps. We also provide a mathematical analysis of RMLPs, offering insights into its role in enhancing ViT-based models and advancing our understanding of contrastive learning.",

Unlike world-model approaches that rely on computationally intensive future scene generation or vision-language-action (VLA) systems constrained by Markov assumptions, we show that a minimal set of semantically rich tokens is sufficient for effective planning. Experiments on the nuPlan benchmark (720 scenarios, over 11,000 samples) using perception-informed BEV representations yield three key findings: (1) even without future prediction, our sparse representation achieves 0.548 m ADE, comparable to or surpassing prior methods reporting around 0.75 m on nuScenes; (2) conditioning trajectory decoding on predicted future tokens reduces ADE to 0.479 m, a 12.6% improvement over current-state baselines; and (3) explicit reconstruction loss offers no benefit and may degrade performance under reliable perception inputs. Notably, we observe the emergence of temporal fuzziness, where the model adaptively attends to task-relevant semantics rather than aligning rigidly to fixed timestamps, providing a cognitive advantage for planning under uncertainty. Our \"token is all you need\" principle marks a paradigm shift from reconstructing the world to understanding it, laying a foundation for cognitively inspired systems that plan through imagination rather than reaction.",

In this paper, we leverage vision-language models' (VLMs') reasoning capabilities to assess the quality of printed parts and introduce in-context learning (ICL) to provide VLMs with necessary application-specific knowledge and demonstration samples. This method eliminates the requirement for large application-specific datasets for training models. We explored different sampling strategies for ICL to search for the optimal configuration that makes use of limited samples. We evaluated these strategies on two VLMs, Gemini-2.5-flash and Gemma3:27b, with quality assessment tasks in wire-laser direct energy deposition processes. The results show that ICL-assisted VLMs can reach quality classification accuracies similar to those of traditional machine learning models while requiring only a minimal number of samples. In addition, unlike traditional classification models that lack transparency, VLMs can generate human-interpretable rationales to enhance trust. Since there are no metrics to evaluate their interpretability in manufacturing applications, we propose two metrics, knowledge relevance and rationale validity, to evaluate the quality of VLMs' supporting rationales. Our results show that ICL-assisted VLMs can address application-specific tasks with limited data, achieving relatively high accuracy while also providing valid supporting rationales for improved decision transparency.",

Methods based on Multi-view Graph Refinement (MGRC) also have limitations such as insufficient consideration of cross-view consistency, difficulty in handling hard-to-distinguish samples in the feature space, and disjointed optimization processes caused by graph construction algorithms. To address these issues, a Multi-View Clustering method via a Fusion-Consensus Graph Convolutional Network (MCFCN) is proposed. The network learns the consensus graph of multi-view data in an end-to-end manner and learns effective consensus representations through a view feature fusion model and a Unified Graph Structure Adapter (UGA). It designs Similarity Matrix Alignment Loss (SMAL) and Feature Representation Alignment Loss (FRAL). With the guidance of consensus, it optimizes view-specific graphs, preserves cross-view topological consistency, promotes the construction of intra-class edges, and realizes effective consensus representation learning with the help of GCN to improve clustering performance. MCFCN demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on eight multi-view benchmark datasets, and its effectiveness is verified by extensive qualitative and quantitative implementations.

Although multi-task learning is an effective way to integrate these tasks, its increasing model parameters and complexity make deployment on on-board devices difficult. To address this challenge, we propose a multi-task model compression framework that combines task-aware safe pruning with feature-level knowledge distillation. Our safe pruning strategy integrates Taylor-based channel importance with gradient conflict penalty to keep important channels while removing redundant and conflicting channels. To mitigate performance degradation after pruning, we further design a task head-agnostic distillation method that transfers intermediate backbone and encoder features from a teacher to a student model as guidance. Experiments on the BDD100K dataset demonstrate that our compressed model achieves a 32.7% reduction in parameters while segmentation performance shows negligible accuracy loss and only a minor decrease in detection (-1.2% for Recall and -1.8% for mAP50) compared to the teacher. The compressed model still runs at 32.7 FPS in real-time. These results show that combining pruning and knowledge distillation provides an effective compression solution for multi-task panoptic perception.",

To address these issues, this paper proposes an end-to-end, data-driven framework specifically for fillet features. We first construct and release a large-scale, diverse benchmark dataset for fillet recognition to address the inadequacy of existing data. Based on it, we propose FilletRec, a lightweight graph neural network. The core innovation of this network is its use of pose-invariant intrinsic geometric features, such as curvature, enabling it to learn more fundamental geometric patterns and thereby achieve high-precision recognition of complex geometric topologies. Experiments show that FilletRec surpasses state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and generalization, while using only 0.2\\%-5.4\\% of the parameters of baseline models, demonstrating high model efficiency. Finally, the framework completes the automated workflow from recognition to simplification by integrating an effective geometric simplification algorithm.",

As video content becomes increasingly complex with diverse behavioral patterns and contextual scenarios, traditional VAD approaches struggle to provide robust assessment for modern surveillance systems. Existing methods either lack comprehensive spatial-temporal modeling or require excessive computational resources for real-time applications. In this regard, we present a Mamba-based multi-scale spatial-temporal learning (M2S2L) framework in this paper. The proposed method employs hierarchical spatial encoders operating at multiple granularities and multi-temporal encoders capturing motion dynamics across different time scales. We also introduce a feature decomposition mechanism to enable task-specific optimization for appearance and motion reconstruction, facilitating more nuanced behavioral modeling and quality-aware anomaly assessment. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that M2S2L framework achieves 98.5%, 92.1%, and 77.9% frame-level AUCs on UCSD Ped2, CUHK Avenue, and ShanghaiTech respectively, while maintaining efficiency with 20.1G FLOPs and 45 FPS inference speed, making it suitable for practical surveillance deployment.",

We introduce the Micro-OD benchmark, a curated collection of 252 images specifically curated for in-context learning, with bounding-box annotations spanning 11 cell types across four sources, including two in-lab expert-annotated sets. We systematically evaluate eight VLMs under few-shot conditions and compare variants with and without implicit test-time reasoning tokens. We further implement a hybrid Few-Shot Object Detection (FSOD) pipeline that combines a detection head with a VLM-based few-shot classifier, which enhances the few-shot performance of recent VLMs on our benchmark. Across datasets, we observe that zero-shot performance is weak due to the domain gap; however, few-shot support consistently improves detection, with marginal gains achieved after six shots. We observe that models with reasoning tokens are more effective for end-to-end localization, whereas simpler variants are more suitable for classifying pre-localized crops. Our results highlight in-context adaptation as a practical path for microscopy, and our benchmark provides a reproducible testbed for advancing open-vocabulary detection in biomedical imaging.",

To address this need, Online Continual Learning (OCL) mechanisms have been proposed, allowing models to update their knowledge incrementally as new data become available while preserving previously acquired information. However, existing OCL approaches for sensor-based HAR are computationally intensive and require extensive labeled samples to represent new changes. Recently, pre-trained model-based (PTM-based) OCL approaches have shown significant improvements in performance and efficiency for computer vision applications. These methods achieve strong generalization capabilities by pre-training complex models on large datasets, followed by fine-tuning on downstream tasks for continual learning. However, applying PTM-based OCL approaches to sensor-based HAR poses significant challenges due to the inherent heterogeneity of HAR datasets and the scarcity of labeled data in post-deployment scenarios. This paper introduces PTRN-HAR, the first successful application of PTM-based OCL to sensor-based HAR. Unlike prior PTM-based OCL approaches, PTRN-HAR pre-trains the feature extractor using contrastive loss with a limited amount of data. This extractor is then frozen during the streaming stage. Furthermore, it replaces the conventional dense classification layer with a relation module network. Our design not only significantly reduces the resource consumption required for model training while maintaining high performance, but also improves data efficiency by reducing the amount of labeled data needed for effective continual learning, as demonstrated through experiments on three public datasets, outperforming the state-of-the-art.

A novel method of RoadTracer using the Teacher-Student based ensemble learning model of Adaptive DBN is proposed, since the road maps contain many complicated features so that a model with high representation power to detect should be required.

In addition, we challenged to apply our method to the detection of available roads when landslide by natural disaster is occurred, in order to rapidly obtain a way of transportation. For fast inference, a small size of the trained model was implemented on a small embedded edge device as lightweight deep learning. We reported the detection results for the satellite image before and after the rainfall disaster in Japan.",

        "abstract": "As digital tools increasingly shape spatial planning practices, understanding how different data sources reflect human experiences of urban environments is essential. Street View Imagery (SVI) and Public Participation GIS (PPGIS) represent two prominent approaches for capturing place-based perceptions that can support urban planning decisions, yet their comparability remains underexplored. This study investigates the alignment between SVI-based perceived attractiveness and residents' reported experiences gathered via a city-wide PPGIS survey in Helsinki, Finland. Using participant-rated SVI data and semantic image segmentation, we trained a machine learning model to predict perceived attractiveness based on visual features. We compared these predictions to PPGIS-identified locations marked as attractive or unattractive, calculating agreement using two sets of strict and moderate criteria. Our findings reveal only partial alignment between the two datasets. While agreement (with a moderate threshold) reached 67% for attractive and 77% for unattractive places, agreement (with a strict threshold) dropped to 27% and 29%, respectively. By analysing a range of contextual variables, including noise, traffic, population presence, and land use, we found that non-visual cues significantly contributed to mismatches. The model failed to account for experiential dimensions such as activity levels and environmental stressors that shape perceptions but are not visible in images. These results suggest that while SVI offers a scalable and visual proxy for urban perception, it cannot fully substitute the experiential richness captured through PPGIS. We argue that both methods are valuable but serve different purposes; therefore, a more integrated approach is needed to holistically capture how people perceive urban environments.",

However, current ST platforms frequently suffer from low resolution, limiting the in-depth understanding of spatial gene expression. Super-resolution approaches promise to enhance ST maps by integrating histology images with gene expressions of profiled tissue spots. However, it remains a challenge to model the interactions between histology images and gene expressions for effective ST enhancement. This study presents a cross-modal cross-content contrastive diffusion framework, called C3-Diff, for ST enhancement with histology images as guidance. In C3-Diff, we firstly analyze the deficiency of traditional contrastive learning paradigm, which is then refined to extract both modal-invariant and content-invariant features of ST maps and histology images. Further, to overcome the problem of low sequencing sensitivity in ST maps, we perform nosing-based information augmentation on the surface of feature unit hypersphere. Finally, we propose a dynamic cross-modal imputation-based training strategy to mitigate ST data scarcity. We tested C3-Diff by benchmarking its performance on four public datasets, where it achieves significant improvements over competing methods. Moreover, we evaluate C3-Diff on downstream tasks of cell type localization, gene expression correlation and single-cell-level gene expression prediction, promoting AI-enhanced biotechnology for biomedical research and clinical applications.

In this work, we investigate a lightweight approach to improve T2V diffusion models using synthetic supervision.

However, even state-of-the-art models often suffer from fine-grained artifacts and poor identity preservation, particularly under challenging poses and expressions. A key limitation of existing approaches is their failure to meaningfully leverage 3D facial structure, which is crucial for disentangling identity from pose and expression. In this work, we propose DiffSwap++, a novel diffusion-based face-swapping pipeline that incorporates 3D facial latent features during training. By guiding the generation process with 3D-aware representations, our method enhances geometric consistency and improves the disentanglement of facial identity from appearance attributes. We further design a diffusion architecture that conditions the denoising process on both identity embeddings and facial landmarks, enabling high-fidelity and identity-preserving face swaps. Extensive experiments on CelebA, FFHQ, and CelebV-Text demonstrate that DiffSwap++ outperforms prior methods in preserving source identity while maintaining target pose and expression. Additionally, we introduce a biometric-style evaluation and conduct a user study to further validate the realism and effectiveness of our approach.

However, by relying on a final softmax classifier, these methods suffer from two fundamental distortions: additive logit shifts that arbitrarily bias importance scores, and sign collapse that conflates excitatory and inhibitory features. We propose a simple, architecture-agnostic dual-branch sigmoid head that decouples localization from classification. Given any pretrained model, we clone its classification head into a parallel branch ending in per-class sigmoid outputs, freeze the original softmax head, and fine-tune only the sigmoid branch with class-balanced binary supervision. At inference, softmax retains recognition accuracy, while class evidence maps are generated from the sigmoid branch -- preserving both magnitude and sign of feature contributions. Our method integrates seamlessly with most CAM variants and incurs negligible overhead. Extensive evaluations on fine-grained tasks (CUB-200-2011, Stanford Cars) and WSOL benchmarks (ImageNet-1K, OpenImages30K) show improved explanation fidelity and consistent Top-1 Localization gains -- without any drop in classification accuracy.

Experimental assessment reveals that the MedGemma-driven classifier exhibits strong performance, exceeding conventional convolutional and autoencoder-based metrics. Additionally, the model leverages MedGemma's transfer learning capabilities, enhancing generalization and optimizing feature engineering. The integration of a modern medical foundation model not only enhances representation learning but also facilitates modular training strategies such as selective encoder block unfreezing for efficient domain adaptation.

At first, we theoretically establish SDS as a simplified instance of the Schrödinger Bridge framework. We prove that SDS employs the reverse process of an Schrödinger Bridge, which, under specific conditions (e.g., a Gaussian noise as one end), collapses to SDS's score function of the pre-trained diffusion model. Based upon this, we introduce Trajectory-Centric Distillation (TraCe), a novel text-to-3D generation framework, which reformulates the mathematically trackable framework of Schrödinger Bridge to explicitly construct a diffusion bridge from the current rendering to its text-conditioned, denoised target, and trains a LoRA-adapted model on this trajectory's score dynamics for robust 3D optimization.

        "abstract": "For embodied agents to effectively understand and interact within the world around them, they require a nuanced comprehension of human actions grounded in physical space. Current action recognition models, often relying on RGB video, learn superficial correlations between patterns and action labels, so they struggle to capture underlying physical interaction dynamics and human poses in complex scenes. We propose a model architecture that grounds action recognition in physical space by fusing two powerful, complementary representations: V-JEPA 2's contextual, predictive world dynamics and CoMotion's explicit, occlusion-tolerant human pose data. Our model is validated on both the InHARD and UCF-19-Y-OCC benchmarks for general action recognition and high-occlusion action recognition, respectively. Our model outperforms three other baselines, especially within complex, occlusive scenes. Our findings emphasize a need for action recognition to be supported by spatial understanding instead of statistical pattern recognition.",

        "abstract": "Modern sensing technologies have enabled the collection of unstructured point cloud data (PCD) of varying sizes, which are used to monitor the geometric accuracy of 3D objects. PCD are widely applied in advanced manufacturing processes, including additive, subtractive, and hybrid manufacturing. To ensure the consistency of analysis and avoid false alarms, preprocessing steps such as registration and mesh reconstruction are commonly applied prior to monitoring. However, these steps are error-prone, time-consuming and may introduce artifacts, potentially affecting monitoring outcomes. In this paper, we present a novel registration-free approach for monitoring PCD of complex shapes, eliminating the need for both registration and mesh reconstruction. Our proposal consists of two alternative feature learning methods and a common monitoring scheme. Feature learning methods leverage intrinsic geometric properties of the shape, captured via the Laplacian and geodesic distances. In the monitoring scheme, thresholding techniques are used to further select intrinsic features most indicative of potential out-of-control conditions. Numerical experiments and case studies highlight the effectiveness of the proposed approach in identifying different types of defects.",

Existing cultural benchmarks focus mainly on object-centric categories (e.g., food, attire, and architecture), overlooking the social and daily activities that more clearly reflect cultural norms. Few metrics exist for measuring cultural faithfulness. We introduce CULTIVate, a benchmark for evaluating T2I models on cross-cultural activities (e.g., greetings, dining, games, traditional dances, and cultural celebrations). CULTIVate spans 16 countries with 576 prompts and more than 19,000 images, and provides an explainable descriptor-based evaluation framework across multiple cultural dimensions, including background, attire, objects, and interactions. We propose four metrics to measure cultural alignment, hallucination, exaggerated elements, and diversity. Our findings reveal systematic disparities: models perform better for global north countries than for the global south, with distinct failure modes across T2I systems. Human studies confirm that our metrics correlate more strongly with human judgments than existing text-image metrics.",

We introduce VMDT (Video-Modal DecodingTrust), the first unified platform for evaluating text-to-video (T2V) and video-to-text (V2T) models across five key trustworthiness dimensions: safety, hallucination, fairness, privacy, and adversarial robustness. Through our extensive evaluation of 7 T2V models and 19 V2T models using VMDT, we uncover several significant insights. For instance, all open-source T2V models evaluated fail to recognize harmful queries and often generate harmful videos, while exhibiting higher levels of unfairness compared to image modality models. In V2T models, unfairness and privacy risks rise with scale, whereas hallucination and adversarial robustness improve -- though overall performance remains low. Uniquely, safety shows no correlation with model size, implying that factors other than scale govern current safety levels. Our findings highlight the urgent need for developing more robust and trustworthy video foundation models, and VMDT provides a systematic framework for measuring and tracking progress toward this goal.

However, establishing screw correspondence, especially in LAT views, remains a significant clinical challenge. This paper introduces a method to address pedicle screw correspondence and pose estimation from dual C-arm images. By comparing screw combinations, the approach demonstrates consistent accuracy in both pairing and registration tasks. The method also employs 2D-3D alignment with screw CAD 3D models to accurately pair and estimate screw pose from dual views. Our results show that the correct screw combination consistently outperforms incorrect pairings across all test cases, even prior to registration. After registration, the correct combination further enhances alignment between projections and images, significantly reducing projection error. This approach shows promise for improving surgical outcomes in spinal procedures by providing reliable feedback on screw positioning.",

        "abstract": "Recent progress in multimodal reasoning has been driven largely by undisclosed datasets and proprietary data synthesis recipes, leaving open questions about how to systematically build large-scale, vision-centric reasoning datasets, particularly for tasks that go beyond visual math. In this work, we introduce a new reasoning data generation framework spanning diverse skills and levels of complexity with over 1M high-quality synthetic vision-centric questions. The dataset also includes preference data and instruction prompts supporting both offline and online RL. Our synthesis framework proceeds in two stages: (1) scale; and (2) complexity. Reasoning traces are then synthesized through a two-stage process that leverages VLMs and reasoning LLMs, producing CoT traces for VLMs that capture the richness and diverse cognitive behaviors found in frontier reasoning models. Remarkably, we show that finetuning Qwen2.5-VL-7B on our data outperforms all open-data baselines across all evaluated vision-centric benchmarks, and even surpasses strong closed-data models such as MiMo-VL-7B-RL on V* Bench, CV-Bench and MMStar-V. Perhaps most surprising, despite being entirely vision-centric, our data transfers positively to text-only reasoning (MMLU-Pro) and audio reasoning (MMAU), demonstrating its effectiveness. Similarly, despite not containing videos or embodied visual data, we observe notable gains when evaluating on a single-evidence embodied QA benchmark (NiEH). Finally, we use our data to analyze the entire VLM post-training pipeline. Our empirical analysis highlights that (i) SFT on high-quality data with non-linear reasoning traces is essential for effective online RL, (ii) staged offline RL matches online RL's performance while reducing compute demands, and (iii) careful SFT on high quality data can substantially improve out-of-domain, cross-modality transfer.",

Although foundation models such as Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) demonstrate strong zero-shot and prompt-guided segmentation capabilities, their performance deteriorates substantially when transferred to medical imaging domains. Current adaptation studies mainly emphasize architectural modifications, while the influence of data characteristics and training regimes has not been systematically examined. In this study, we present a comprehensive, data-centric investigation of SAM2 adaptation for ultrasound video segmentation. We analyze how training-set size, video duration, and augmentation schemes affect adaptation performance under three paradigms: task-specific fine-tuning, intermediate adaptation, and multi-task joint training, across five SAM2 variants and multiple prompting modes. We further design six ultrasound-specific augmentations, assessing their effect relative to generic strategies. Experiments on three representative ultrasound datasets reveal that data scale and temporal context play a more decisive role than model architecture or initialization. Moreover, joint training offers an efficient compromise between modality alignment and task specialization. This work aims to provide empirical insights for developing efficient, data-aware adaptation pipelines for SAM2 in ultrasound video analysis.",

Nevertheless, the analysis of such images remains highly dependent on the subjective expert interpretation. Deep learning approaches have been proposed for csPCa lesions detection and segmentation, but they remain limited due to their reliance on extensively annotated datasets. Moreover, the high lesion variability across prostate zones poses additional challenges, even for expert radiologists. This work introduces a second-order geometric attention (SOGA) mechanism that guides a dedicated segmentation network, through skip connections, to detect csPCa lesions. The proposed attention is modeled on the Riemannian manifold, learning from symmetric positive definitive (SPD) representations. The proposed mechanism was integrated into standard U-Net and nnU-Net backbones, and was validated on the publicly available PI-CAI dataset, achieving an Average Precision (AP) of 0.37 and an Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC-ROC) of 0.83, outperforming baseline networks and attention-based methods. Furthermore, the approach was evaluated on the Prostate158 dataset as an independent test cohort, achieving an AP of 0.37 and an AUC-ROC of 0.75, confirming robust generalization and suggesting discriminative learned representations.",

To address this gap, we propose TCSA-UDA, a Text-driven Cross-Semantic Alignment framework that leverages domain-invariant textual class descriptions to guide visual representation learning. Our approach introduces a vision-language covariance cosine loss to directly align image encoder features with inter-class textual semantic relations, encouraging semantically meaningful and modality-invariant feature representations. Additionally, we incorporate a prototype alignment module that aligns class-wise pixel-level feature distributions across domains using high-level semantic prototypes. This mitigates residual category-level discrepancies and enhances cross-modal consistency. Extensive experiments on challenging cross-modality cardiac, abdominal, and brain tumor segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our TCSA-UDA framework significantly reduces domain shift and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art UDA methods, establishing a new paradigm for integrating language-driven semantics into domain-adaptive medical image analysis.",

        "abstract": "Medical image segmentation faces challenges due to variations in anatomical structures. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) effectively capture local features, they struggle with modeling long-range dependencies. Transformers mitigate this issue with self-attention mechanisms but lack the ability to preserve local contextual information. State-of-the-art models primarily follow an encoder-decoder architecture, achieving notable success. However, two key limitations remain: (1) Shallow layers, which are closer to the input, capture fine-grained details but suffer from information loss as data propagates through deeper layers. (2) Inefficient integration of local details and global context between the encoder and decoder stages. To address these challenges, we propose the MACMD-based decoder, which enhances attention mechanisms and facilitates channel mixing between encoder and decoder stages via skip connections. This design leverages hierarchical dilated convolutions, attention-driven modulation, and a cross channel-mixing module to capture long-range dependencies while preserving local contextual details, essential for precise medical image segmentation. We evaluated our approach using multiple transformer encoders on both binary and multi-organ segmentation tasks. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of Dice score and computational efficiency, highlighting its effectiveness in achieving accurate and robust segmentation performance.

        "abstract": "End-to-end text spotting aims to jointly optimize text detection and recognition within a unified framework. Despite significant progress, designing an accurate and efficient end-to-end text spotter for arbitrary-shaped text remains largely unsolved. We identify the primary bottleneck as the lack of a reliable and efficient text detection method. To address this, we propose a novel parameterized text shape method based on low-rank approximation for precise detection and a triple assignment detection head to enable fast inference. Specifically, unlike other shape representation methods that employ data-irrelevant parameterization, our data-driven approach derives a low-rank subspace directly from labeled text boundaries. To ensure this process is robust against the inherent annotation noise in this data, we utilize a specialized recovery method based on an $\\ell_1$-norm formulation, which accurately reconstructs the text shape with only a few key orthogonal vectors. By exploiting the inherent shape correlation among different text contours, our method achieves consistency and compactness in shape representation. Next, the triple assignment scheme introduces a novel architecture where a deep sparse branch (for stabilized training) is used to guide the learning of an ultra-lightweight sparse branch (for accelerated inference), while a dense branch provides rich parallel supervision. Building upon these advancements, we integrate the enhanced detection module with a lightweight recognition branch to form an end-to-end text spotting framework, termed LRANet++, capable of accurately and efficiently spotting arbitrary-shaped text. Extensive experiments on several challenging benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of LRANet++ compared to state-of-the-art methods. Code will be available at: this https URL",

        "abstract": "The quadratic compute and memory costs of global self-attention severely limit its use in high-resolution images. Local attention reduces complexity by restricting attention to neighborhoods. Block-sparse kernels can further improve the efficiency of local attention, but conventional local attention patterns often fail to deliver significant speedups because tokens within a window are not contiguous in the 1D sequence. This work proposes a novel method for constructing windows and neighborhoods based on the Hilbert curve. Image tokens are first reordered along a Hilbert curve, and windows and neighborhoods are then formed on the reordered 1D sequence. From a block-sparse perspective, this strategy significantly increases block sparsity and can be combined with existing block-sparse kernels to improve the efficiency of 2D local attention. Experiments show that the proposed Hilbert Window Attention and Hilbert Slide Attention can accelerate window attention and slide attention by about $4\\times$ and $18\\times$, respectively. To assess practicality, the strategy is instantiated as the Hilbert Window Transformer and the Hilbert Neighborhood Transformer, both of which achieve end-to-end speedups with minimal accuracy loss. Overall, combining Hilbert-guided local attention with block-sparse kernels offers a general and practical approach to enhancing the efficiency of 2D local attention for images.

The existing rPPG model is usually based on the transformer module, which has low computation efficiency. Recently, the Mamba model has garnered increasing attention due to its efficient performance in natural language processing tasks, demonstrating potential as a substitute for transformer-based algorithms. However, the Mambaout model and its variants prove that the SSM module, which is the core component of the Mamba model, is unnecessary for the vision task. Therefore, we hope to prove the feasibility of using the Mambaout-based module to remotely learn the heart rate. Specifically, we propose a novel rPPG algorithm called uncomplicated and enhanced learning capability rPPG (TYrPPG). This paper introduces an innovative gated video understanding block (GVB) designed for efficient analysis of RGB videos. Based on the Mambaout structure, this block integrates 2D-CNN and 3D-CNN to enhance video understanding for analysis. In addition, we propose a comprehensive supervised loss function (CSL) to improve the model's learning capability, along with its weakly supervised variants. The experiments show that our TYrPPG can achieve state-of-the-art performance in commonly used datasets, indicating its prospects and superiority in remote heart rate estimation.

Handwriting-often disrupted in prodromal AD-provides a non-invasive and cost-effective window into subtle motor and cognitive decline. Existing handwriting-based AD studies, mostly relying on online trajectories and hand-crafted features, have not systematically examined how task type influences diagnostic performance and cross-task generalization. Meanwhile, large-scale vision language models have demonstrated remarkable zero or few-shot anomaly detection in natural images and strong adaptability across medical modalities such as chest X-ray and brain MRI. However, handwriting-based disease detection remains largely unexplored within this paradigm. To close this gap, we introduce a lightweight Cross-Layer Fusion Adapter framework that repurposes CLIP for handwriting-based AD screening. CLFA implants multi-level fusion adapters within the visual encoder to progressively align representations toward handwriting-specific medical cues, enabling prompt-free and efficient zero-shot inference. Using this framework, we systematically investigate cross-task generalization-training on a specific handwriting task and evaluating on unseen ones-to reveal which task types and writing patterns most effectively discriminate AD. Extensive analyses further highlight characteristic stroke patterns and task-level factors that contribute to early AD identification, offering both diagnostic insights and a benchmark for handwriting-based cognitive assessment.",

Second, we develop enhanced sampling guidance methods that operate on off-the-shelf classifiers without requiring retraining.

In this study, we construct a high-quality point cloud dataset for 3D segmentation of surface defects in CPS, i.e., CPS3D-Seg, which has the best point resolution and precision compared to existing 3D industrial datasets. CPS3D-Seg consists of 1300 point cloud samples under 20 product categories, and each sample provides accurate point-level annotations. Meanwhile, we conduct a comprehensive benchmark based on SOTA point cloud segmentation algorithms to validate the effectiveness of CPS3D-Seg.

        "abstract": "Recent advancements in large-scale generative models have enabled the creation of high-quality images and videos, but have also raised significant safety concerns regarding the generation of unsafe content. To mitigate this, concept erasure methods have been developed to remove undesirable concepts from pre-trained models. However, existing methods remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can regenerate the erased content. Moreover, achieving robust erasure often degrades the model's generative quality for safe, unrelated concepts, creating a difficult trade-off between safety and performance. To address this challenge, we introduce Classifier-Guided Concept Erasure (CGCE), an efficient plug-and-play framework that provides robust concept erasure for diverse generative models without altering their original weights. CGCE uses a lightweight classifier operating on text embeddings to first detect and then refine prompts containing undesired concepts. This approach is highly scalable, allowing for multi-concept erasure by aggregating guidance from several classifiers. By modifying only unsafe embeddings at inference time, our method prevents harmful content generation while preserving the model's original quality on benign prompts. Extensive experiments show that CGCE achieves state-of-the-art robustness against a wide range of red-teaming attacks. Our approach also maintains high generative utility, demonstrating a superior balance between safety and performance. We showcase the versatility of CGCE through its successful application to various modern T2I and T2V models, establishing it as a practical and effective solution for safe generative AI.",

The sensor pixels under each micro-lens receive light from a sub-aperture of the main lens. This enables the image sensor to capture both spatial information and the angular resolution of a scene point. This additional angular information is used to estimate the depth of a 3-D scene. The continuum of virtual viewpoints in light field data enables efficient depth estimation using Epipolar Line Images (EPIs) with robust occlusion handling. However, the trade-off between angular information and spatial information is very critical and depends on the focal position of the camera. To design, develop, implement, and test novel disparity-based light field depth estimation algorithms, the availability of suitable light field image datasets is essential. In this paper, a publicly available light field image dataset is introduced and thoroughly described. We have also demonstrated the effect of focal position on the disparity of a 3-D point as well as the shortcomings of the currently available light field dataset. The proposed dataset contains 285 light field images captured using a Lytro Illum LF camera and 13 synthetic LF images. The proposed dataset also comprises a synthetic dataset with similar disparity characteristics to those of a real light field camera.

While deep learning methods have shown promise in SAR despeckling, most methods employ a single unified network to process the entire image, failing to account for the distinct speckle statistics associated with different spatial physical characteristics. It often leads to artifacts, blurred edges, and texture distortion. To address these issues, we propose SAR-FAH, a frequency-adaptive heterogeneous despeckling model based on a divide-and-conquer architecture. First, wavelet decomposition is used to separate the image into frequency sub-bands carrying different intrinsic characteristics. Inspired by their differing noise characteristics, we design specialized sub-networks for different frequency components. The tailored approach leverages statistical variations across frequencies, improving edge and texture preservation while suppressing noise. Specifically, for the low-frequency part, denoising is formulated as a continuous dynamic system via neural ordinary differential equations, ensuring structural fidelity and sufficient smoothness that prevents artifacts. For high-frequency sub-bands rich in edges and textures, we introduce an enhanced U-Net with deformable convolutions for noise suppression and enhanced features. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real SAR images validate the superior performance of the proposed model in noise removal and structural preservation.",

We evaluate our method on 3DSSG and Replica benchmarks across four tasks-scene question answering, visual grounding, instance retrieval, and task planning-demonstrating robust generalization and superior performance in diverse environments. Our results highlight the effectiveness of combining open-vocabulary perception with retrieval-based reasoning for scalable 3D scene understanding.",

To address these challenges, we propose Gradient-Aware Balanced Feature Fusion (GABFusion), which dynamically balances gradient magnitudes and fuses task-specific features in a quantization-friendly manner. We further introduce Attention Distribution Alignment (ADA), a feature-level distillation strategy tailored for quantized models. Our method demonstrates strong generalization across network architectures and QAT algorithms, with theoretical guarantees on gradient bias reduction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our strategy consistently enhances a variety of QAT methods across different network architectures and bit-widths. On PASCAL VOC and COCO datasets, the proposed approach achieves average mAP improvements of approximately 3.3% and 1.6%, respectively. When applied to YOLOv5 under 4-bit quantization, our method narrows the accuracy gap with the full-precision model to only 1.7% on VOC, showcasing its effectiveness in preserving performance under low-bit constraints. Notably, the proposed framework is modular, easy to integrate, and compatible with any existing QAT technique-enhancing the performance of quantized models without requiring modifications to the original network architecture.",

Existing analyses are insufficiently comprehensive and lack examination covering visual and textual tokens, model components, and the full range of layers. This limitation restricts actionable insights to improve the faithfulness of model output and the development of downstream tasks, such as hallucination mitigation. To address this limitation, we introduce Fine-grained Cross-modal Causal Tracing (FCCT) framework, which systematically quantifies the causal effects on visual object perception. FCCT conducts fine-grained analysis covering the full range of visual and textual tokens, three core model components including multi-head self-attention (MHSA), feed-forward networks (FFNs), and hidden states, across all decoder layers. Our analysis is the first to demonstrate that MHSAs of the last token in middle layers play a critical role in aggregating cross-modal information, while FFNs exhibit a three-stage hierarchical progression for the storage and transfer of visual object representations. Building on these insights, we propose Intermediate Representation Injection (IRI), a training-free inference-time technique that reinforces visual object information flow by precisely intervening on cross-modal representations at specific components and layers, thereby enhancing perception and mitigating hallucination. Consistent improvements across five widely used benchmarks and LVLMs demonstrate IRI achieves state-of-the-art performance, while preserving inference speed and other foundational performance.",

Pre-trained on ImageNet-1K with CoMA, DyViT matches the downstream performance of MAE using only 12% of the pre-training epochs, demonstrating more effective learning.

        "abstract": "Generative modeling frameworks have emerged as an effective approach to capture high-dimensional image distributions from large datasets without requiring domain-specific knowledge, a capability essential for longitudinal disease progression modeling. Recent generative modeling approaches have attempted to capture progression by mapping images into a latent representational space and then controlling and guiding the representations to generate follow-up images from a baseline image. However, existing approaches impose constraints on distribution learning, leading to latent spaces with limited controllability to generate follow-up images without explicit supervision from subject-specific longitudinal images. In order to enable controlled movements in the latent representational space and generate progression images from a baseline image in an unsupervised manner, we introduce a conditionable Diffusion Auto-encoder framework. The explicit encoding mechanism of image-diffusion auto-encoders forms a compact latent space capturing high-level semantics, providing means to disentangle information relevant for progression. Our approach leverages this latent space to condition and apply controlled shifts to baseline representations for generating follow-up. Controllability is induced by restricting these shifts to a subspace, thereby isolating progression-related factors from subject identity-preserving components. The shifts are implicitly guided by correlating with progression attributes, without requiring subject-specific longitudinal supervision. We validate the generations through image quality metrics, volumetric progression analysis, and downstream classification in Alzheimer's disease datasets from two different sources and disease categories. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach for Alzheimer's progression modeling and longitudinal image generation.",

        "abstract": "Open-vocabulary scene graph generation (OVSGG) extends traditional SGG by recognizing novel objects and relationships beyond predefined categories, leveraging the knowledge from pre-trained large-scale models. Existing OVSGG methods always adopt a two-stage pipeline: 1) \\textit{Infusing knowledge} into large-scale models via pre-training on large datasets; 2) \\textit{Transferring knowledge} from pre-trained models with fully annotated scene graphs during supervised fine-tuning. However, due to a lack of explicit interaction modeling, these methods struggle to distinguish between interacting and non-interacting instances of the same object category. This limitation induces critical issues in both stages of OVSGG: it generates noisy pseudo-supervision from mismatched objects during knowledge infusion, and causes ambiguous query matching during knowledge transfer. To this end, in this paper, we propose an inter\\textbf{AC}tion-\\textbf{C}entric end-to-end OVSGG framework (\\textbf{ACC}) in an interaction-driven paradigm to minimize these mismatches. For \\textit{interaction-centric knowledge infusion}, ACC employs a bidirectional interaction prompt for robust pseudo-supervision generation to enhance the model's interaction knowledge. For \\textit{interaction-centric knowledge transfer}, ACC first adopts interaction-guided query selection that prioritizes pairing interacting objects to reduce interference from non-interacting ones. Then, it integrates interaction-consistent knowledge distillation to bolster robustness by pushing relational foreground away from the background while retaining general knowledge. Extensive experimental results on three benchmarks show that ACC achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating the potential of interaction-centric paradigms for real-world applications.",

Although facial expression recognition algorithms demonstrate impressive performance on high-resolution images, their effectiveness tends to degrade when confronted with low-resolution images. We find it is because: 1) low-resolution images lack detail information; 2) current methods complete weak global modeling, which make it difficult to extract discriminative features. To alleviate the above issues, we proposed a novel global multiple extraction network (GME-Net) for low-resolution facial expression recognition, which incorporates 1) a hybrid attention-based local feature extraction module with attention similarity knowledge distillation to learn image details from high-resolution network; 2) a multi-scale global feature extraction module with quasi-symmetric structure to mitigate the influence of local image noise and facilitate capturing global image features. As a result, our GME-Net is capable of extracting expression-related discriminative features. Extensive experiments conducted on several widely-used datasets demonstrate that the proposed GME-Net can better recognize low-resolution facial expression and obtain superior performance than existing solutions.",

Therefore, aiming to improve the generalizability, we reinterpret road elements as rasterized polygons and design a concise framework based on instance segmentation. Initially, a segmentation-based transformer is employed to deliver instance masks in an end-to-end manner; succeeding this step, a Potrace-based[17] post-processing module is used to ultimately yield vectorized map elements.

In this paper, we propose a novel few-shot unsupervised multimodal industrial anomaly detection method based on structural commonality, CIF (Commonality In Few). To extract intra-class structural information, we employ hypergraphs, which are capable of modeling higher-order correlations, to capture the structural commonality within training samples, and use a memory bank to store this intra-class structural prior. Firstly, we design a semantic-aware hypergraph construction module tailored for single-semantic industrial images, from which we extract common structures to guide the construction of the memory bank. Secondly, we use a training-free hypergraph message passing module to update the visual features of test samples, reducing the distribution gap between test features and features in the memory bank. We further propose a hyperedge-guided memory search module, which utilizes structural information to assist the memory search process and reduce the false positive rate. Experimental results on the MVTec 3D-AD dataset and the Eyecandies dataset show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in few-shot settings.

Artificial intelligence may aid in pre-screening. Purpose: To evaluate the DINOv2-based Medical Slice Transformer (MST) for ruling out significant findings (Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System [BI-RADS] >=4) in contrast-enhanced and non-contrast-enhanced abbreviated breast MRI. Materials and Methods: This institutional review board approved retrospective study included 1,847 single-breast MRI examinations (377 BI-RADS >=4) from an in-house dataset and 924 from an external validation dataset (Duke). Four abbreviated protocols were tested: T1-weighted early subtraction (T1sub), diffusion-weighted imaging with b=1500 s/mm2 (DWI1500), DWI1500+T2-weighted (T2w), and T1sub+T2w. Performance was assessed at 90%, 95%, and 97.5% sensitivity using five-fold cross-validation and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) analysis. AUC differences were compared with the DeLong test. False negatives were characterized, and attention maps of true positives were rated in the external dataset. Results: A total of 1,448 female patients (mean age, 49 +/- 12 years) were included. T1sub+T2w achieved an AUC of 0.77 +/- 0.04; DWI1500+T2w, 0.74 +/- 0.04 (p=0.15). At 97.5% sensitivity, T1sub+T2w had the highest specificity (19% +/- 7%), followed by DWI1500+T2w (17% +/- 11%). Missed lesions had a mean diameter <10 mm at 95% and 97.5% thresholds for both T1sub and DWI1500, predominantly non-mass enhancements. External validation yielded an AUC of 0.77, with 88% of attention maps rated good or moderate. Conclusion: At 97.5% sensitivity, the MST framework correctly triaged cases without BI-RADS >=4, achieving 19% specificity for contrast-enhanced and 17% for non-contrast-enhanced MRI. Further research is warranted before clinical implementation.",

        "abstract": "The integration of medical images with clinical context is essential for generating accurate and clinically interpretable radiology reports. However, current automated methods often rely on resource-heavy Large Language Models (LLMs) or static knowledge graphs and struggle with two fundamental challenges in real-world clinical data: (1) missing modalities, such as incomplete clinical context , and (2) feature entanglement, where mixed modality-specific and shared information leads to suboptimal fusion and clinically unfaithful hallucinated findings. To address these challenges, we propose the DiA-gnostic VLVAE, which achieves robust radiology reporting through Disentangled Alignment. Our framework is designed to be resilient to missing modalities by disentangling shared and modality-specific features using a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) based Vision-Language Variational Autoencoder (VLVAE). A constrained optimization objective enforces orthogonality and alignment between these latent representations to prevent suboptimal fusion. A compact LLaMA-X decoder then uses these disentangled representations to generate reports efficiently. On the IU X-Ray and MIMIC-CXR datasets, DiA has achieved competetive BLEU@4 scores of 0.266 and 0.134, respectively.

Even though deep learning models have demonstrated potential, standard convolutional architectures frequently fall short in capturing enough global context, resulting in segmentations that are anatomically inconsistent. To overcome these drawbacks, we suggest a flexible, conditional Denoising Diffusion Model that combines an enhanced UNet-based generative decoder with a Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder for global feature extraction. We introduce three primary innovations: 1) an Adaptive Conditioning Bridge (ACB) for efficient, multi-scale fusion of semantic features; 2) a novel Topological Denoising Consistency (TDC) loss component that regularizes training by penalizing structural inconsistencies during denoising; and 3) a dual-head architecture that leverages the denoising objective as a powerful regularizer, enabling a lightweight auxiliary head to perform rapid and accurate inference on smaller datasets and a noise prediction head. Our framework establishes a new state-of-the-art on public breast ultrasound datasets, achieving Dice scores of 0.96 on BUSI, 0.90 on BrEaST and 0.97 on BUS-UCLM. Comprehensive ablation studies empirically validate that the model components are critical for achieving these results and for producing segmentations that are not only accurate but also anatomically plausible.",

The proposed framework first performs quasi-canonicalization of point clouds in the SE(3) Lie group space, and then models articulated objects using Point Pair Features (PPF) to predict pose voting parameters by leveraging the invariance properties of SE(3). Finally, semantic information of joint axes is incorporated to impose unified kinematic constraints across all parts of the articulated object. PPF-Tracker is systematically evaluated on both synthetic datasets and real-world scenarios, demonstrating strong generalization across diverse and challenging environments. Experimental results highlight the effectiveness and robustness of PPF-Tracker in multi-frame pose tracking of articulated objects.

To enhance user control over subject placement, several layout-guided methods have been proposed. However, these methods face numerous challenges, particularly in compositional scenes. Unintended subjects often appear outside the layouts, generated images can be out-of-distribution and contain unnatural artifacts, or attributes bleed across subjects, leading to incorrect visual outputs. In this work, we propose MALeR, a method that addresses each of these challenges. Given a text prompt and corresponding layouts, our method prevents subjects from appearing outside the given layouts while being in-distribution. Additionally, we propose a masked, attribute-aware binding mechanism that prevents attribute leakage, enabling accurate rendering of subjects with multiple attributes, even in complex compositional scenes. Qualitative and quantitative evaluation demonstrates that our method achieves superior performance in compositional accuracy, generation consistency, and attribute binding compared to previous work.

To examine this gap, we systematically analyze social biases in five open-source VLMs for an occupation prediction task, on the FairFace dataset. Across 32 occupations and three different prompting styles, we elicit both predictions and reasoning.

This study explores distributed deep learning for denoising chest X-ray images from the NIH Chest X-ray14 dataset, using additive Gaussian noise as a lightweight obfuscation technique. We implement and evaluate U-Net and U-Net++ architectures under single-GPU, standard multi-GPU (DataParallel), and optimized multi-GPU training configurations using PyTorch's DistributedDataParallel (DDP) and Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP). Our results show that U-Net++ consistently delivers superior denoising performance, achieving competitive Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structured Similarity Index Method (SSIM) scores, though with less performance in Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) compared to U-Net under low and moderate noise levels. This indicates U-Net++'s enhanced structural fidelity and low perceptual similarity. Meanwhile, our optimized training pipeline reduces training time by over 60% for both models compared to single-GPU training, and outperforms standard DataParallel by over 40%, with only a minor accuracy drop for both models (trading some accuracy for speed). These findings highlight the effectiveness of software-level optimization in distributed learning for medical imaging.

To address this challenge, we propose a novel knowledge inheritance approach named OSKT (One-Shot Knowledge Transfer), which consolidates the knowledge of the teacher model into an intermediate carrier called a weight chain. When a downstream scenario demands a model that meets specific resource constraints, this weight chain can be expanded to the target model size without additional computation.

This article introduces MiVID, a lightweight, self-supervised, diffusion-based framework for video interpolation. Our model eliminates the need for explicit motion estimation by combining a 3D U-Net backbone with transformer-style temporal attention, trained under a hybrid masking regime that simulates occlusions and motion uncertainty. The use of cosine-based progressive masking and adaptive loss scheduling allows our network to learn robust spatiotemporal representations without any high-frame-rate supervision. Our framework is evaluated on UCF101-7 and DAVIS-7 datasets. MiVID is trained entirely on CPU using the datasets and 9-frame video segments, making it a low-resource yet highly effective pipeline. Despite these constraints, our model achieves optimal results at just 50 epochs, competitive with several supervised this http URL work demonstrates the power of self-supervised diffusion priors for temporally coherent frame synthesis and provides a scalable path toward accessible and generalizable VFI systems.",

        "abstract": "Visual place recognition (VPR) is typically regarded as a specific image retrieval task, whose core lies in representing images as global descriptors. Over the past decade, dominant VPR methods (e.g., NetVLAD) have followed a paradigm that first extracts the patch features/tokens of the input image using a backbone, and then aggregates these patch features into a global descriptor via an aggregator. This backbone-plus-aggregator paradigm has achieved overwhelming dominance in the CNN era and remains widely used in transformer-based models. In this paper, however, we argue that a dedicated aggregator is not necessary in the transformer era, that is, we can obtain robust global descriptors only with the backbone. Specifically, we introduce some learnable aggregation tokens, which are prepended to the patch tokens before a particular transformer block. All these tokens will be jointly processed and interact globally via the intrinsic self-attention mechanism, implicitly aggregating useful information within the patch tokens to the aggregation tokens. Finally, we only take these aggregation tokens from the last output tokens and concatenate them as the global representation. Although implicit aggregation can provide robust global descriptors in an extremely simple manner, where and how to insert additional tokens, as well as the initialization of tokens, remains an open issue worthy of further exploration. To this end, we also propose the optimal token insertion strategy and token initialization method derived from empirical studies. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several VPR datasets with higher efficiency and ranks 1st on the MSLS challenge leaderboard.

        "abstract": "The raw depth images captured by RGB-D cameras using Time-of-Flight (TOF) or structured light often suffer from incomplete depth values due to weak reflections, boundary shadows, and artifacts, which limit their applications in downstream vision tasks. Existing methods address this problem through depth completion in the image domain, but they overlook the physical characteristics of raw depth images. It has been observed that the presence of invalid depth areas alters the frequency distribution pattern. In this work, we propose a Spatio-Spectral Mutual Learning framework (S2ML) to harmonize the advantages of both spatial and frequency domains for depth completion. Specifically, we consider the distinct properties of amplitude and phase spectra and devise a dedicated spectral fusion module. Meanwhile, the local and global correlations between spatial-domain and frequency-domain features are calculated in a unified embedding space. The gradual mutual representation and refinement encourage the network to fully explore complementary physical characteristics and priors for more accurate depth completion. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed S2ML method, outperforming the state-of-the-art method CFormer by 0.828 dB and 0.834 dB on the NYU-Depth V2 and SUN RGB-D datasets, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Streaming free-viewpoint video~(FVV) in real-time still faces significant challenges, particularly in training, rendering, and transmission efficiency. Harnessing superior performance of 3D Gaussian Splatting~(3DGS), recent 3DGS-based FVV methods have achieved notable breakthroughs in both training and rendering. However, the storage requirements of these methods can reach up to $10$MB per frame, making stream FVV in real-time impossible. To address this problem, we propose a novel FVV representation, dubbed StreamSTGS, designed for real-time streaming. StreamSTGS represents a dynamic scene using canonical 3D Gaussians, temporal features, and a deformation field. For high compression efficiency, we encode canonical Gaussian attributes as 2D images and temporal features as a video. This design not only enables real-time streaming, but also inherently supports adaptive bitrate control based on network condition without any extra training. Moreover, we propose a sliding window scheme to aggregate adjacent temporal features to learn local motions, and then introduce a transformer-guided auxiliary training module to learn global motions. On diverse FVV benchmarks, StreamSTGS demonstrates competitive performance on all metrics compared to state-of-the-art methods. Notably, StreamSTGS increases the PSNR by an average of $1$dB while reducing the average frame size to just $170$KB. The code is publicly available on this https URL.",

Differing from existing transformer-based offline text-to-video generation models, Neodragon is the first to have been specifically optimised for mobile hardware to achieve efficient and high-fidelity video synthesis. We achieve this through four key technical contributions: (1) Replacing the original large 4.762B T5xxl Text-Encoder with a much smaller 0.2B DT5 (DistilT5) with minimal quality loss, enabled through a novel Text-Encoder Distillation procedure. (2) Proposing an Asymmetric Decoder Distillation approach allowing us to replace the native codec-latent-VAE decoder with a more efficient one, without disturbing the generative latent-space of the generation pipeline. (3) Pruning of MMDiT blocks within the denoiser backbone based on their relative importance, with recovery of original performance through a two-stage distillation process. (4) Reducing the NFE (Neural Functional Evaluation) requirement of the denoiser by performing step distillation using DMD adapted for pyramidal flow-matching, thereby substantially accelerating video generation. When paired with an optimised SSD1B first-frame image generator and QuickSRNet for 2x super-resolution, our end-to-end Neodragon system becomes a highly parameter (4.945B full model), memory (3.5GB peak RAM usage), and runtime (6.7s E2E latency) efficient mobile-friendly model, while achieving a VBench total score of 81.61. By enabling low-cost, private, and on-device text-to-video synthesis, Neodragon democratizes AI-based video content creation, empowering creators to generate high-quality videos without reliance on cloud services.

While supervised learning has achieved significant progress in this area, it relies heavily on large-scale labeled datasets, which are difficult to obtain in practical scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a pseudo label-based unsupervised method called LoopExpose for arbitrary-length exposure correction. A nested loop optimization strategy is proposed to address the exposure correction problem, where the correction model and pseudo-supervised information are jointly optimized in a two-level framework. Specifically, the upper-level trains a correction model using pseudo-labels generated through multi-exposure fusion at the lower level. A feedback mechanism is introduced where corrected images are fed back into the fusion process to refine the pseudo-labels, creating a self-reinforcing learning loop. Considering the dominant role of luminance calibration in exposure correction, a Luminance Ranking Loss is introduced to leverage the relative luminance ordering across the input sequence as a self-supervised constraint. Extensive experiments on different benchmark datasets demonstrate that LoopExpose achieves superior exposure correction and fusion performance, outperforming existing state-of-the-art unsupervised methods.

Conventional deblurring approaches are often inadequate in handling spatially varying blur and typically fall short in modeling the long-range dependencies necessary for restoring textual clarity. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a hybrid deep learning framework that combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with vision transformers (ViTs), thereby leveraging both local feature extraction and global contextual reasoning. The architecture employs a CNN-based encoder-decoder to preserve structural details, while a transformer module enhances global awareness through self-attention. Training is conducted on a curated dataset derived from TextOCR, where sharp scene-text samples are paired with synthetically blurred versions generated using realistic motion-blur kernels of multiple sizes and orientations. Model optimization is guided by a composite loss that incorporates mean absolute error (MAE), squared error (MSE), perceptual similarity, and structural similarity (SSIM). Quantitative eval- uations show that the proposed method attains 32.20 dB in PSNR and 0.934 in SSIM, while remaining lightweight with 2.83 million parameters and an average inference time of 61 ms. These results highlight the effectiveness and computational efficiency of the CNN-ViT hybrid design, establishing its practicality for real-world motion-blurred scene-text restoration.",

In this paper, we propose LFlow (Latent Refinement via Flows), a training-free framework for solving linear inverse problems via pretrained latent flow priors. LFlow leverages the efficiency of flow matching to perform ODE sampling in latent space along an optimal path. This latent formulation further allows us to introduce a theoretically grounded posterior covariance, derived from the optimal vector field, enabling effective flow guidance.

        "abstract": "Real-time processing of UAV imagery is crucial for applications requiring urgent geospatial information, such as disaster response, where rapid decision-making and accurate spatial data are essential. However, processing high-resolution imagery in real time presents significant challenges due to the computational demands of feature extraction, matching, and bundle adjustment (BA). Conventional BA methods either downsample images, sacrificing important details, or require extensive processing time, making them unsuitable for time-critical missions. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel real-time BA framework that operates directly on fullresolution UAV imagery without downsampling. Our lightweight, onboard-compatible approach divides each image into user-defined patches (e.g., NxN grids, default 150x150 pixels) and dynamically tracks them across frames using UAV GNSS/IMU data and a coarse, globally available digital surface model (DSM). This ensures spatial consistency for robust feature extraction and matching between patches. Overlapping relationships between images are determined in real time using UAV navigation system, enabling the rapid selection of relevant neighbouring images for localized BA. By limiting optimization to a sliding cluster of overlapping images, including those from adjacent flight strips, the method achieves real-time performance while preserving the accuracy of global BA. The proposed algorithm is designed for seamless integration into the DLR Modular Aerial Camera System (MACS), supporting largearea mapping in real time for disaster response, infrastructure monitoring, and coastal protection. Validation on MACS datasets with 50MP images demonstrates that the method maintains precise camera orientations and high-fidelity mapping across multiple strips, running full bundle adjustment in under 2 seconds without GPU acceleration.",

However, early filming equipment limitations have degraded videos of last-century performances by renowned artists (e.g., low frame rates and resolution), hindering archival efforts. Although space-time video super-resolution (STVSR) has advanced significantly, applying it directly to opera videos remains challenging. The scarcity of datasets impedes the recovery of high frequency details, and existing STVSR methods lack global modeling capabilities, compromising visual quality when handling opera's characteristic large motions. To address these challenges, we pioneer a large scale Chinese Opera Video Clip (COVC) dataset and propose the Mamba-based multiscale fusion network for space-time Opera Video Super-Resolution (MambaOVSR). Specifically, MambaOVSR involves three novel components: the Global Fusion Module (GFM) for motion modeling through a multiscale alternating scanning mechanism, and the Multiscale Synergistic Mamba Module (MSMM) for alignment across different sequence lengths. Additionally, our MambaVR block resolves feature artifacts and positional information loss during alignment. Experimental results on the COVC dataset show that MambaOVSR significantly outperforms the SOTA STVSR method by an average of 1.86 dB in terms of PSNR. Dataset and Code will be publicly released.",

Using Grounding DINO and a curated subset of the ADE20K dataset as a proxy for the urban built environment, the system detects urban objects and builds co-occurrence embeddings that reveal common spatial configurations. From this analysis, the user receives five statistically likely complements to a chosen anchor object. A vision language model then reasons over the scene image and the selected pair to suggest a third object that completes a more complex urban tactic. The workflow keeps people in control of selection and refinement and aims to move beyond top-down master planning by grounding choices in everyday patterns and lived experience.",

        "abstract": "Pre-trained vision language models have shown remarkable performance on visual recognition tasks, but they typically assume the availability of complete multimodal inputs during both training and inference. In real-world scenarios, however, modalities may be missing due to privacy constraints, collection difficulties, or resource limitations. While previous approaches have addressed this challenge using prompt learning techniques, they fail to capture the cross-modal relationships necessary for effective multimodal visual recognition and suffer from inevitable computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce MoRA, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that explicitly models cross-modal interactions while maintaining modality-specific adaptations. MoRA introduces modality-common parameters between text and vision encoders, enabling bidirectional knowledge transfer. Additionally, combined with the modality-specific parameters, MoRA allows the backbone model to maintain inter-modality interaction and enable intra-modality flexibility. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that MoRA achieves an average performance improvement in missing-modality scenarios by 5.24% and uses only 25.90% of the inference time compared to the SOTA method while requiring only 0.11% of trainable parameters compared to full fine-tuning.",

To address this, we propose Temporal-Guided VFM (TGVFM), a novel framework that integrates VFMs with our temporal context fusion block seamlessly to bridge this gap.

By retraining event-to-video models on real-world data and leveraging transformer-based VFMs, TGVFM preserves spatiotemporal dynamics while harnessing pretrained representations. Experiments demonstrate SoTA performance across semantic segmentation, depth estimation, and object detection, with improvements of 16%, 21%, and 16% over existing methods, respectively.

While deep learning-based motion deblurring methods have achieved remarkable progress, existing approaches face fundamental challenges in capturing the long-range spatial dependencies inherent in motion blur patterns. Traditional convolutional methods rely on limited receptive fields and require extremely deep networks to model global spatial relationships. These limitations motivate the need for alternative approaches that incorporate physical priors to guide feature evolution during restoration. In this paper, we propose a progressive training framework that integrates physics-informed PDE dynamics into state-of-the-art restoration architectures. By leveraging advection-diffusion equations to model feature evolution, our approach naturally captures the directional flow characteristics of motion blur while enabling principled global spatial modeling. Our PDE-enhanced deblurring models achieve superior restoration quality with minimal overhead, adding only approximately 1\\% to inference GMACs while providing consistent improvements in perceptual quality across multiple state-of-the-art architectures. Comprehensive experiments on standard motion deblurring benchmarks demonstrate that our physics-informed approach improves PSNR and SSIM significantly across four diverse architectures, including FFTformer, NAFNet, Restormer, and Stripformer. These results validate that incorporating mathematical physics principles through PDE-based global layers can enhance deep learning-based image restoration, establishing a promising direction for physics-informed neural network design in computer vision applications.",

To address these challenges, we propose AdaDrive, an adaptively collaborative slow-fast framework that optimally determines when and how LLMs contribute to decision-making. (1) When to activate the LLM: AdaDrive employs a novel adaptive activation loss that dynamically determines LLM invocation based on a comparative learning mechanism, ensuring activation only in complex or critical scenarios. (2) How to integrate LLM assistance: Instead of rigid binary activation, AdaDrive introduces an adaptive fusion strategy that modulates a continuous, scaled LLM influence based on scene complexity and prediction confidence, ensuring seamless collaboration with conventional planners. Through these strategies, AdaDrive provides a flexible, context-aware framework that maximizes decision accuracy without compromising real-time performance.

TMM-NN implements this through a lightweight, query-specific trigger patch. The patch is added to the query image, and the network is weakly ``backdoored'' so that any input with the patch is steered toward a dummy class. Images similar to the query need only a slight shift and are classified as the dummy class with high probability, while dissimilar ones are less affected. By ranking candidates by this confidence, TMM-NN retrieves the most semantically related neighbours.

Mainstream text-to-video (T2V) models lack fine-grained lighting control due to text's inherent limitation in describing lighting details and insufficient pre-training on lighting-related prompts. Additionally, constructing high-quality relighting training data is challenging, as real-world controllable lighting data is scarce. To address these issues, we propose RelightMaster, a novel framework for accurate and controllable video relighting. First, we build RelightVideo, the first dataset with identical dynamic content under varying precise lighting conditions based on the Unreal Engine. Then, we introduce Multi-plane Light Image (MPLI), a novel visual prompt inspired by Multi-Plane Image (MPI). MPLI models lighting via K depth-aligned planes, representing 3D light source positions, intensities, and colors while supporting multi-source scenarios and generalizing to unseen light setups. Third, we design a Light Image Adapter that seamlessly injects MPLI into pre-trained Video Diffusion Transformers (DiT): it compresses MPLI via a pre-trained Video VAE and injects latent light features into DiT blocks, leveraging the base model's generative prior without catastrophic forgetting. Experiments show that RelightMaster generates physically plausible lighting and shadows and preserves original scene content. Demos are available at this https URL.",

LaneDiffusion innovatively employs diffusion models to generate lane centerline priors at the Bird's Eye View (BEV) feature level, instead of directly predicting vectorized centerlines. Our method integrates a Lane Prior Injection Module (LPIM) and a Lane Prior Diffusion Module (LPDM) to effectively construct diffusion targets and manage the diffusion process.

However, the rapid progress of MLLMs is outpacing the complexity of existing video datasets, while the manual annotation of new, high-quality data remains prohibitively expensive. This work investigates a pivotal question: Can the rich, intrinsic information within videos be harnessed to self-generate high-quality, verifiable training data? To investigate this, we introduce three self-supervised pretext tasks: Anomaly Grounding, Object Counting, and Temporal Jigsaw. We construct the Video Intrinsic Understanding Benchmark (VIUBench) to validate their difficulty, revealing that current state-of-the-art MLLMs struggle significantly on these tasks. Building upon these pretext tasks, we develop the VideoSSR-30K dataset and propose VideoSSR, a novel video self-supervised reinforcement learning framework for RLVR. Extensive experiments across 17 benchmarks, spanning four major video domains (General Video QA, Long Video QA, Temporal Grounding, and Complex Reasoning), demonstrate that VideoSSR consistently enhances model performance, yielding an average improvement of over 5\\%. These results establish VideoSSR as a potent foundational framework for developing more advanced video understanding in MLLMs. The code is available at this https URL.",

Concurrently, deep learning (DL) models have demonstrated promise in image-based ovarian lesion characterization. This study evaluates radiologist performance applying O-RADS v2022, compares it to leading convolutional neural network (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT) models, and investigates the diagnostic gains achieved by hybrid human-AI frameworks. Methods: In this single-center, retrospective cohort study, a total of 512 adnexal mass images from 227 patients (110 with at least one malignant cyst) were included. Sixteen DL models, including DenseNets, EfficientNets, ResNets, VGGs, Xception, and ViTs, were trained and validated. A hybrid model integrating radiologist O-RADS scores with DL-predicted probabilities was also built for each scheme. Results: Radiologist-only O-RADS assessment achieved an AUC of 0.683 and an overall accuracy of 68.0%. CNN models yielded AUCs of 0.620 to 0.908 and accuracies of 59.2% to 86.4%, while ViT16-384 reached the best performance, with an AUC of 0.941 and an accuracy of 87.4%. Hybrid human-AI frameworks further significantly enhanced the performance of CNN models; however, the improvement for ViT models was not statistically significant (P-value >0.05). Conclusions: DL models markedly outperform radiologist-only O-RADS v2022 assessment, and the integration of expert scores with AI yields the highest diagnostic accuracy and discrimination. Hybrid human-AI paradigms hold substantial potential to standardize pelvic ultrasound interpretation, reduce false positives, and improve detection of high-risk lesions.",

Current approaches that directly adopt standard VLMs for chemical tasks suffer from two primary issues: (i) computational inefficiency of processing entire chemical images with non-informative backgrounds. (ii) a narrow scope on molecular-level tasks that restricts progress in chemical reasoning. In this work, we propose \\textbf{TinyChemVL}, an efficient and powerful chemical VLM that leverages visual token reduction and reaction-level tasks to improve model efficiency and reasoning capacity. Also, we propose \\textbf{ChemRxn-V}, a reaction-level benchmark for assessing vision-based reaction recognition and prediction tasks. Directly predicting reaction products from molecular images poses a non-trivial challenge, as it requires models to integrate both recognition and reasoning capacities. Our results demonstrate that with only 4B parameters, TinyChemVL achieves superior performance on both molecular and reaction tasks while demonstrating faster inference and training speeds compared to existing models. Notably, TinyChemVL outperforms ChemVLM while utilizing only 1/16th of the visual tokens. This work builds efficient yet powerful VLMs for chemical domains by co-designing model architecture and task complexity.",

However, by observing the MMD posts, we hold that the text modality may be much more informative than the image modality because the text generally describes the whole event/story of the current post but the image often presents partial scenes only. Our preliminary empirical results indicate that the image modality exactly contributes less to MMD. Upon this idea, we propose a new MMD method named RETSIMD. Specifically, we suppose that each text can be divided into several segments, and each text segment describes a partial scene that can be presented by an image. Accordingly, we split the text into a sequence of segments, and feed these segments into a pre-trained text-to-image generator to augment a sequence of images. We further incorporate two auxiliary objectives concerning text-image and image-label mutual information, and further post-train the generator over an auxiliary text-to-image generation benchmark dataset. Additionally, we propose a graph structure by defining three heuristic relationships between images, and use a graph neural network to generate the fused features. Extensive empirical results validate the effectiveness of RETSIMD.",

In this work, we propose a novel Spatial and Frequency Feature Reconstruction method (SFFR) method, which leverages the spatial-frequency feature representation mechanisms of the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) to reconstruct complementary representations in both spatial and frequency domains prior to feature fusion. The core components of SFFR are the proposed Frequency Component Exchange KAN (FCEKAN) module and Multi-Scale Gaussian KAN (MSGKAN) module. The FCEKAN introduces an innovative selective frequency component exchange strategy that effectively enhances the complementarity and consistency of cross-modal features based on the frequency feature of RGB and IR images. The MSGKAN module demonstrates excellent nonlinear feature modeling capability in the spatial domain. By leveraging multi-scale Gaussian basis functions, it effectively captures the feature variations caused by scale changes at different UAV flight altitudes, significantly enhancing the model's adaptability and robustness to scale variations. It is experimentally validated that our proposed FCEKAN and MSGKAN modules are complementary and can effectively capture the frequency and spatial semantic features respectively for better feature fusion. Extensive experiments on the SeaDroneSee, DroneVehicle and DVTOD datasets demonstrate the superior performance and significant advantages of the proposed method in UAV multispectral object perception task.

However, purely data-driven 3DGS often struggles to capture the diverse physics-driven motion patterns in dynamic scenes. To fill this gap, we propose Physics-Informed Deformable Gaussian Splatting (PIDG), which treats each Gaussian particle as a Lagrangian material point with time-varying constitutive parameters and is supervised by 2D optical flow via motion projection. Specifically, we adopt static-dynamic decoupled 4D decomposed hash encoding to reconstruct geometry and motion efficiently. Subsequently, we impose the Cauchy momentum residual as a physics constraint, enabling independent prediction of each particle's velocity and constitutive stress via a time-evolving material field. Finally, we further supervise data fitting by matching Lagrangian particle flow to camera-compensated optical flow, which accelerates convergence and improves generalization. Experiments on a custom physics-driven dataset as well as on standard synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate significant gains in physical consistency and monocular dynamic reconstruction quality.",

Existing generative-model-based approaches, particularly diffusion-model approaches that directly learn the posterior, may suffer from inflexibility -- they require conditioning signals during training, support only a fixed number of input views, and need complete retraining for different measurements. Recent diffusion-based methods have attempted to address this by combining prior models with likelihood updates, but they rely on heuristic fixed step sizes for the likelihood update that lead to slow convergence and suboptimal reconstruction quality. We advance this line of approach by integrating our novel Forward Curvature-Matching (FCM) update method with diffusion sampling. Our method dynamically determines optimal step sizes using only forward automatic differentiation and finite-difference curvature estimates, enabling precise optimization of the likelihood update. This formulation enables high-fidelity reconstruction from both single-view and multi-view inputs, and supports various input modalities through simple operator substitution -- all without retraining. Experiments on ShapeNet and CO3D datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior reconstruction quality at matched or lower NFEs, yielding higher F-score and lower CD and EMD, validating its efficiency and adaptability for practical applications.

Treated as \"blind\" solvers, encoder-decoder transformers accurately reconstruct the original layout by reasoning over token sequences alone. Despite being deliberately restricted from accessing visual input, our models achieve state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks, often outperforming vision-based methods.

We introduce CINEMAE, a novel paradigm for AIGC image detection that adapts the core principles of text detection methods to the visual domain. Our key insight is that Masked AutoEncoder (MAE), trained to reconstruct masked patches conditioned on visible context, naturally encodes semantic consistency expectations. We formalize this reconstruction process probabilistically, computing conditional Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL, p(masked | visible)) to quantify local semantic anomalies. By aggregating these patch-level statistics with global MAE features through learned fusion, CINEMAE achieves strong cross-generator generalization. Trained exclusively on Stable Diffusion v1.4, our method achieves over 95% accuracy on all eight unseen generators in the GenImage benchmark, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art detectors.

However, imbalanced unimodal performance often leads to suboptimal fused representations. Existing approaches typically adopt fixed primary modality strategies to maximize dominant modality advantages, yet fail to adapt to dynamic variations in modality importance across different samples. Moreover, non-language modalities suffer from sequential redundancy and noise, degrading model performance when they serve as primary inputs. To address these issues, this paper proposes a modality optimization and dynamic primary modality selection framework (MODS). First, a Graph-based Dynamic Sequence Compressor (GDC) is constructed, which employs capsule networks and graph convolution to reduce sequential redundancy in acoustic/visual modalities. Then, we develop a sample-adaptive Primary Modality Selector (MSelector) for dynamic dominance determination. Finally, a Primary-modality-Centric Cross-Attention (PCCA) module is designed to enhance dominant modalities while facilitating cross-modal interaction. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that MODS outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior performance by effectively balancing modality contributions and eliminating redundant noise.",

        "abstract": "Detailed structural and species information on individual tree level is increasingly important to support precision forestry, biodiversity conservation, and provide reference data for biomass and carbon mapping. Point clouds from airborne and ground-based laser scanning are currently the most suitable data source to rapidly derive such information at scale. Recent advancements in deep learning improved segmenting and classifying individual trees and identifying semantic tree components. However, deep learning models typically require large amounts of annotated training data which limits further improvement. Producing dense, high-quality annotations for 3D point clouds, especially in complex forests, is labor-intensive and challenging to scale. We explore strategies to reduce dependence on large annotated datasets using self-supervised and transfer learning architectures. Our objective is to improve performance across three tasks: instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and tree classification using realistic and operational training sets. Our findings indicate that combining self-supervised learning with domain adaptation significantly enhances instance segmentation compared to training from scratch (AP50 +16.98%), self-supervised learning suffices for semantic segmentation (mIoU +1.79%), and hierarchical transfer learning enables accurate classification of unseen species (Jaccard +6.07%). To simplify use and encourage uptake, we integrated the tasks into a unified framework, streamlining the process from raw point clouds to tree delineation, structural analysis, and species classification. Pretrained models reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions by ~21%. This open-source contribution aims to accelerate operational extraction of individual tree information from laser scanning point clouds to support forestry, biodiversity, and carbon mapping.",

These models underpin diverse applications including energy modeling, urban planning, autonomous navigation, and real-time reasoning. Despite recent advances in 3D urban modeling, most learning-based models are trained on building datasets with limited architectural diversity, which significantly undermines their generalizability across heterogeneous urban environments. To address this limitation, we present BuildingWorld, a comprehensive and structured 3D building dataset designed to bridge the gap in stylistic diversity. It encompasses buildings from geographically and architecturally diverse regions -- including North America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Oceania -- offering a globally representative dataset for urban-scale foundation modeling and analysis. Specifically, BuildingWorld provides about five million LOD2 building models collected from diverse sources, accompanied by real and simulated airborne LiDAR point clouds. This enables comprehensive research on 3D building reconstruction, detection and segmentation. Cyber City, a virtual city model, is introduced to enable the generation of unlimited training data with customized and structurally diverse point cloud distributions. Furthermore, we provide standardized evaluation metrics tailored for building reconstruction, aiming to facilitate the training, evaluation, and comparison of large-scale vision models and foundation models in structured 3D urban environments.",

This paper introduces GazeVLM, a novel Vision-Language Model (VLM) for multi-task gaze understanding in images, addressing person detection, gaze target detection, and gaze object identification. While other transformer-based methods exist for gaze analysis, GazeVLM represents, to our knowledge, the first application of a VLM to these combined tasks, allowing for selective execution of each task. Through the integration of visual (RGB and depth) and textual modalities, our ablation study on visual input combinations revealed that a fusion of RGB images with HHA-encoded depth maps, guided by text prompts, yields superior performance. We also introduce an object-level gaze detection metric for gaze object identification ($AP_{ob}$).

In this paper, we propose V-Shuffle, a zero-shot style transfer method that leverages multiple style images from the same style domain to effectively navigate the trade-off between content preservation and style fidelity. V-Shuffle implicitly disrupts the semantic content of the style images by shuffling the value features within the self-attention layers of the diffusion model, thereby preserving low-level style representations. We further introduce a Hybrid Style Regularization that complements these low-level representations with high-level style textures to enhance style fidelity. Empirical results demonstrate that V-Shuffle achieves excellent performance when utilizing multiple style images. Moreover, when applied to a single style image, V-Shuffle outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.",

Specifically, we propose a plug-and-play Scarf Neck module for DETR variants, which introduces a modality-agnostic deformable attention mechanism to enable the IVOD detector to flexibly adapt to any single or double modalities during training and inference. When training Scarf-DETR, we design a pseudo modality dropout strategy to fully utilize the multi-modality information, making the detector compatible and robust to both working modes of single and double modalities. Moreover, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark for the modality-incomplete IVOD task aimed at thoroughly assessing situations where the absent modality is either dominant or secondary.

To address these issues, we propose Vision-only Dynamic NeRF (VDNeRF), a method that accurately recovers camera trajectories and learns spatiotemporal representations for dynamic urban scenes without requiring additional camera pose information or expensive sensor data. VDNeRF employs two separate NeRF models to jointly reconstruct the scene. The static NeRF model optimizes camera poses and static background, while the dynamic NeRF model incorporates the 3D scene flow to ensure accurate and consistent reconstruction of dynamic objects. To address the ambiguity between camera motion and independent object motion, we design an effective and powerful training framework to achieve robust camera pose estimation and self-supervised decomposition of static and dynamic elements in a scene. Extensive evaluations on mainstream urban driving datasets demonstrate that VDNeRF surpasses state-of-the-art NeRF-based pose-free methods in both camera pose estimation and dynamic novel view synthesis.",

Cross-view image retrieval-based localization is a promising alternative, yet substantial geometric and appearance domain gaps exist between oblique UAV views and nadir satellite orthophotos. Moreover, conventional approaches often depend on complex network architectures, text prompts, or large amounts of annotation, which hinders generalization. To address these issues, we propose DiffusionUavLoc, a cross-view localization framework that is image-prompted, text-free, diffusion-centric, and employs a VAE for unified representation. We first use training-free geometric rendering to synthesize pseudo-satellite images from UAV imagery as structural prompts. We then design a text-free conditional diffusion model that fuses multimodal structural cues to learn features robust to viewpoint changes. At inference, descriptors are computed at a fixed time step t and compared using cosine similarity.

Recently, to improve its performance and make it work more like a pathologist, several MIL approaches based on the use of multiple-resolution images have been proposed, delivering often higher performance than those that use single-resolution images. Despite impressive recent developments of multiple-resolution MIL, previous approaches only focus on improving performance, thereby lacking research on well-calibrated MIL that clinical experts can rely on for trustworthy diagnostic results. In this study, we propose Uncertainty-Focused Calibrated MIL (UFC-MIL), which more closely mimics the pathologists' examination behaviors while providing calibrated diagnostic predictions, using multiple images with different resolutions. UFC-MIL includes a novel patch-wise loss that learns the latent patterns of instances and expresses their uncertainty for classification. Also, the attention-based architecture with a neighbor patch aggregation module collects features for the classifier. In addition, aggregated predictions are calibrated through patch-level uncertainty without requiring multiple iterative inferences, which is a key practical advantage. Against challenging public datasets, UFC-MIL shows superior performance in model calibration while achieving classification accuracy comparable to that of state-of-the-art methods.",

        "abstract": "Multi-modal fusion methods often suffer from two types of representation collapse: feature collapse where individual dimensions lose their discriminative power (as measured by eigenspectra), and modality collapse where one dominant modality overwhelms the other. Applications like human action anticipation that require fusing multifarious sensor data are hindered by both feature and modality collapse. However, existing methods attempt to counter feature collapse and modality collapse separately. This is because there is no unifying framework that efficiently addresses feature and modality collapse in conjunction. In this paper, we posit the utility of effective rank as an informative measure that can be utilized to quantify and counter both the representation collapses. We propose \\textit{Rank-enhancing Token Fuser}, a theoretically grounded fusion framework that selectively blends less informative features from one modality with complementary features from another modality. We show that our method increases the effective rank of the fused representation. To address modality collapse, we evaluate modality combinations that mutually increase each others' effective rank. We show that depth maintains representational balance when fused with RGB, avoiding modality collapse. We validate our method on action anticipation, where we present \\texttt{R3D}, a depth-informed fusion framework. Extensive experiments on NTURGBD, UTKinect, and DARai demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods by up to 3.74\\%.

We introduce EIDSeg, the first large-scale semantic segmentation dataset specifically for post-earthquake social media imagery. The dataset comprises 3,266 images from nine major earthquakes (2008-2023), annotated across five classes of infrastructure damage: Undamaged Building, Damaged Building, Destroyed Building, Undamaged Road, and Damaged Road. We propose a practical three-phase cross-disciplinary annotation protocol with labeling guidelines that enables consistent segmentation by non-expert annotators, achieving over 70% inter-annotator agreement. We benchmark several state-of-the-art segmentation models, identifying Encoder-only Mask Transformer (EoMT) as the top-performing method with a Mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 80.8%.

        "abstract": "Despite recent advances in single-object front-facing inpainting using NeRF and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), inpainting in complex 360° scenes remains largely underexplored. This is primarily due to three key challenges: (i) identifying target objects in the 3D field of 360° environments, (ii) dealing with severe occlusions in multi-object scenes, which makes it hard to define regions to inpaint, and (iii) maintaining consistent and high-quality appearance across views effectively. To tackle these challenges, we propose Inpaint360GS, a flexible 360° editing framework based on 3DGS that supports multi-object removal and high-fidelity inpainting in 3D space. By distilling 2D segmentation into 3D and leveraging virtual camera views for contextual guidance, our method enables accurate object-level editing and consistent scene completion. We further introduce a new dataset tailored for 360° inpainting, addressing the lack of ground truth object-free scenes. Experiments demonstrate that Inpaint360GS outperforms existing baselines and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Project page: this https URL",

        "abstract": "Video large language models (Video LLMs) have recently achieved strong performance on tasks such as captioning, summarization, and question answering. Many models and training methods explicitly encourage continuity across events to enhance narrative coherence. While this improves fluency, it also introduces an inductive bias that prioritizes storyline consistency over strict grounding in visual evidence. We identify this bias, which we call narrative prior, as a key driver of two errors: hallucinations, where non-existent events are introduced or existing ones are misinterpreted, and omissions, where factual events are suppressed because they are misaligned with surrounding context. To systematically evaluate narrative prior-induced errors, we introduce NOAH, a large-scale benchmark that constructs composite videos by inserting clips from other sources into target videos. By varying semantic similarity and insertion position, our benchmark enables controlled and scalable analysis of narrative priors. We design one captioning task with tailored metrics and three QA tasks - Existence, Temporal, and Narrative - yielding more than 60K evaluation samples. Extensive experiments yield three key findings: (i) most Video LLMs exhibit hallucinations and omissions driven by narrative priors, (ii) the patterns of these errors vary across architectures and depend on event similarity and insertion position, and (iii) reliance on narrative priors intensifies under sampling with fewer frames, amplifying errors when event continuity is weak. We establish NOAH as the first standardized evaluation of narrative prior-induced hallucination and omission in Video LLMs, providing a foundation for developing more reliable and trustworthy models.

Despite excelling on natural images, VLMs often struggle with stylized line art, onomatopoeia, and densely packed multi-panel layouts. To address this gap, we introduce AI4VA-FG, the first fine-grained and comprehensive benchmark for VLM-based comic understanding. It spans tasks from foundational recognition and detection to high-level character reasoning and narrative construction, supported by dense annotations for characters, poses, and depth. Beyond that, we evaluate state-of-the-art proprietary models, including GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5, and open-source models such as Qwen2.5-VL, revealing substantial performance deficits across core tasks of our benchmarks and underscoring that comic understanding remains an unsolved challenge. To enhance VLMs' capabilities in this domain, we systematically investigate post-training strategies, including supervised fine-tuning on solutions (SFT-S), supervised fine-tuning on reasoning trajectories (SFT-R), and reinforcement learning (RL). Beyond that, inspired by the emerging \"Thinking with Images\" paradigm, we propose Region-Aware Reinforcement Learning (RARL) for VLMs, which trains models to dynamically attend to relevant regions through zoom-in operations. We observe that when applied to the Qwen2.5-VL model, RL and RARL yield significant gains in low-level entity recognition and high-level storyline ordering, paving the way for more accurate and efficient VLM applications in the comics domain.",

        "abstract": "Deeply understanding sports requires an intricate blend of fine-grained visual perception and rule-based reasoning - a challenge that pushes the limits of current multimodal models. To succeed, models must master three critical capabilities: perceiving nuanced visual details, applying abstract sport rule knowledge, and grounding that knowledge in specific visual evidence. Current sports benchmarks either cover single sports or lack the detailed reasoning chains and precise visual grounding needed to robustly evaluate these core capabilities in a multi-sport context. To address this gap, we introduce SportR, the first multi-sports large-scale benchmark designed to train and evaluate MLLMs on the fundamental reasoning required for sports intelligence. Our benchmark provides a dataset of 5,017 images and 2,101 videos. To enable granular evaluation, we structure our benchmark around a progressive hierarchy of question-answer (QA) pairs designed to probe reasoning at increasing depths - from simple infraction identification to complex penalty prediction. For the most advanced tasks requiring multi-step reasoning, such as determining penalties or explaining tactics, we provide 7,118 high-quality, human-authored Chain of Thought (CoT) annotations. In addition, our benchmark incorporates both image and video modalities and provides manual bounding box annotations to test visual grounding in the image part directly. Extensive experiments demonstrate the profound difficulty of our benchmark. State-of-the-art baseline models perform poorly on our most challenging tasks. While training on our data via Supervised Fine-Tuning and Reinforcement Learning improves these scores, they remain relatively low, highlighting a significant gap in current model capabilities. SportR presents a new challenge for the community, providing a critical resource to drive future research in multimodal sports reasoning.",

We present the Surgical Procedure Phase, Keypoint, and Instrument Recognition (PhaKIR) dataset, comprising eight complete laparoscopic cholecystectomy videos recorded at three medical centers.

PhaKIR is, to our knowledge, the first multi-institutional dataset to jointly provide phase labels, instrument pose information, and pixel-accurate instrument segmentations, while also enabling the exploitation of temporal context since full surgical procedure sequences are available. It served as the basis for the PhaKIR Challenge as part of the Endoscopic Vision (EndoVis) Challenge at MICCAI 2024 to benchmark methods in surgical scene understanding, thereby further validating the dataset's quality and relevance.

        "abstract": "Multi-Modal Image Fusion (MMIF) aims to integrate complementary image information from different modalities to produce informative images. Previous deep learning-based MMIF methods generally adopt Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Transformers for feature extraction. However, these methods deliver unsatisfactory performances due to the limited receptive field of CNNs and the high computational cost of Transformers. Recently, Mamba has demonstrated a powerful potential for modeling long-range dependencies with linear complexity, providing a promising solution to MMIF. Unfortunately, Mamba lacks full spatial and frequency perceptions, which are very important for MMIF. Moreover, employing Image Reconstruction (IR) as an auxiliary task has been proven beneficial for MMIF. However, a primary challenge is how to leverage IR efficiently and effectively. To address the above issues, we propose a novel framework named Spatial-Frequency Enhanced Mamba Fusion (SFMFusion) for MMIF. More specifically, we first propose a three-branch structure to couple MMIF and IR, which can retain complete contents from source images. Then, we propose the Spatial-Frequency Enhanced Mamba Block (SFMB), which can enhance Mamba in both spatial and frequency domains for comprehensive feature extraction. Finally, we propose the Dynamic Fusion Mamba Block (DFMB), which can be deployed across different branches for dynamic feature fusion. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves better results than most state-of-the-art methods on six MMIF datasets. The source code is available at this https URL.",

However, most existing approaches treat these domains as independent tasks, overlooking their physiological interplay and shared imaging biomarkers. We propose an Explainable Cross-Disease Reasoning Framework that enables interpretable cardiopulmonary risk assessment from a single LDCT scan. The framework introduces an agentic reasoning process that emulates clinical diagnostic thinking-first perceiving pulmonary findings, then reasoning through established medical knowledge, and finally deriving a cardiovascular judgment with explanatory rationale. It integrates three synergistic components: a pulmonary perception module that summarizes lung abnormalities, a knowledge-guided reasoning module that infers their cardiovascular implications, and a cardiac representation module that encodes structural biomarkers. Their outputs are fused to produce a holistic cardiovascular risk prediction that is both accurate and physiologically grounded. Experiments on the NLST cohort demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance for CVD screening and mortality prediction, outperforming single-disease and purely image-based baselines. Beyond quantitative gains, the framework provides human-verifiable reasoning that aligns with cardiological understanding, revealing coherent links between pulmonary abnormalities and cardiac stress mechanisms. Overall, this work establishes a unified and explainable paradigm for cardiovascular analysis from LDCT, bridging the gap between image-based prediction and mechanism-based medical interpretation.",

To address this, we propose UniADC, a unified anomaly detection and classification model that can effectively perform both tasks with only a few or even no anomaly images. Specifically, UniADC consists of two key components: a training-free controllable inpainting network and a multi-task discriminator. The inpainting network can synthesize anomaly images of specific categories by repainting normal regions guided by anomaly priors, and can also repaint few-shot anomaly samples to augment the available anomaly data. The multi-task discriminator is then trained on these synthesized samples, enabling precise anomaly detection and classification by aligning fine-grained image features with anomaly-category embeddings. We conduct extensive experiments on three anomaly detection and classification datasets, including MVTec-FS, MTD, and WFDD, and the results demonstrate that UniADC consistently outperforms existing methods in anomaly detection, localization, and classification.

While recent approaches leverage a limited amount of labeled target-domain data to improve performance, the severe imbalance between abundant source data and scarce target data remains a critical challenge for effective representation learning. We present the first frequency-space perspective to analyze this issue and identify two key challenges: (1) models are easily biased toward source-specific knowledge encoded in the low-frequency components of source data, and (2) the sparsity of target data hinders the learning of high-frequency, domain-generalizable features. To address these challenges, we propose \\textbf{FreqGRL}, a novel CD-FSL framework that mitigates the impact of data imbalance in the frequency space. Specifically, we introduce a Low-Frequency Replacement (LFR) module that substitutes the low-frequency components of source tasks with those from the target domain to create new source tasks that better align with target characteristics, thus reducing source-specific biases and promoting generalizable representation learning. We further design a High-Frequency Enhancement (HFE) module that filters out low-frequency components and performs learning directly on high-frequency features in the frequency space to improve cross-domain generalization. Additionally, a Global Frequency Filter (GFF) is incorporated to suppress noisy or irrelevant frequencies and emphasize informative ones, mitigating overfitting risks under limited target supervision. Extensive experiments on five standard CD-FSL benchmarks demonstrate that our frequency-guided framework achieves state-of-the-art performance.",

Unlike prior approaches that feed text-derived SEG token embeddings into segmentation models, NOVO instead generates a coarse mask and point prompts from the VLM output. These visual prompts are compatible with the Segment Anything Model (SAM), preserving alignment with its pretrained capabilities. To further enhance boundary quality and enable instance-level segmentation, we introduce a training-free refinement module that reduces visual artifacts and improves the quality of segmentation masks. We also present RISeg, a new benchmark comprising 918 images, 2,533 instance-level masks, and diverse reasoning queries to evaluate this task.

The subtle distinguishing patterns, handling new species and the inherent open-set nature make the problem even harder. To address these complexities, foundation models trained on labeled, large-scale and multi-species animal Re-ID datasets have recently been introduced to enable zero-shot Re-ID. However, our benchmarking reveals significant gaps in their zero-shot Re-ID performance for both known and unknown species. While this highlights the need for collecting labeled data in new domains, exhaustive annotation for Re-ID is laborious and requires domain expertise. Our analyses show that existing unsupervised (USL) and AL Re-ID methods underperform for animal Re-ID. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel AL Re-ID framework that leverages complementary clustering methods to uncover and target structurally ambiguous regions in the embedding space for mining pairs of samples that are both informative and broadly representative. Oracle feedback on these pairs, in the form of must-link and cannot-link constraints, facilitates a simple annotation interface, which naturally integrates with existing USL methods through our proposed constrained clustering refinement algorithm. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that, by utilizing only 0.033% of all annotations, our approach consistently outperforms existing foundational, USL and AL baselines. Specifically, we report an average improvement of 10.49%, 11.19% and 3.99% (mAP) on 13 wildlife datasets over foundational, USL and AL methods, respectively, while attaining state-of-the-art performance on each dataset.

To overcome these limitations, we propose AnoStyler, a lightweight yet effective method that frames zero-shot anomaly generation as text-guided style transfer. Given a single normal image along with its category label and expected defect type, an anomaly mask indicating the localized anomaly regions and two-class text prompts representing the normal and anomaly states are generated using generalizable category-agnostic procedures. A lightweight U-Net model trained with CLIP-based loss functions is used to stylize the normal image into a visually realistic anomaly image, where anomalies are localized by the anomaly mask and semantically aligned with the text prompts. Extensive experiments on the MVTec-AD and VisA datasets show that AnoStyler outperforms existing anomaly generation methods in generating high-quality and diverse anomaly images.

To address this issue, we propose novel Spatial-Projection Alignment (SPAN) with two pivotal components: (i). Spatial Point Alignment enforces an explicit global spatial constraint between the predicted and ground-truth 3D bounding boxes, thereby rectifying spatial drift caused by decoupled attribute regression. (ii). 3D-2D Projection Alignment ensures that the projected 3D box is aligned tightly within its corresponding 2D detection bounding box on the image plane, mitigating projection misalignment overlooked in previous works. To ensure training stability, we further introduce a Hierarchical Task Learning strategy that progressively incorporates spatial-projection alignment as 3D attribute predictions refine, preventing early stage error propagation across attributes.

However, most existing methods compress images into 2-D latent spaces via convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or Swin Transformers, which tend to retain substantial spatial redundancy, thereby limiting overall compression performance. In this paper, we propose a novel Mixed RWKV-Transformer (MRT) architecture that encodes images into more compact 1-D latent representations by synergistically integrating the complementary strengths of linear-attention-based RWKV and self-attention-based Transformer models. Specifically, MRT partitions each image into fixed-size windows, utilizing RWKV modules to capture global dependencies across windows and Transformer blocks to model local redundancies within each window. The hierarchical attention mechanism enables more efficient and compact representation learning in the 1-D domain. To further enhance compression efficiency, we introduce a dedicated RWKV Compression Model (RCM) tailored to the structure characteristics of the intermediate 1-D latent features in MRT. Extensive experiments on standard image compression benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach. The proposed MRT framework consistently achieves superior reconstruction quality at bitrates below 0.02 bits per pixel (bpp). Quantitative results based on the DISTS metric show that MRT significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art 2-D architecture GLC, achieving bitrate savings of 43.75%, 30.59% on the Kodak and CLIC2020 test datasets, respectively.",

Despite extensive research on OOD detection in 2D images, direct transfer to 3D LiDAR point clouds has been proven ineffective. Current LiDAR OOD methods struggle to distinguish rare anomalies from common classes, leading to high false-positive rates and overconfident errors in safety-critical settings. We propose Relative Energy Learning (REL), a simple yet effective framework for OOD detection in LiDAR point clouds. REL leverages the energy gap between positive (in-distribution) and negative logits as a relative scoring function, mitigating calibration issues in raw energy values and improving robustness across various scenes. To address the absence of OOD samples during training, we propose a lightweight data synthesis strategy called Point Raise, which perturbs existing point clouds to generate auxiliary anomalies without altering the inlier semantics.

        "abstract": "We present AvatarTex, a high-fidelity facial texture reconstruction framework capable of generating both stylized and photorealistic textures from a single image. Existing methods struggle with stylized avatars due to the lack of diverse multi-style datasets and challenges in maintaining geometric consistency in non-standard textures. To address these limitations, AvatarTex introduces a novel three-stage diffusion-to-GAN pipeline. Our key insight is that while diffusion models excel at generating diversified textures, they lack explicit UV constraints, whereas GANs provide a well-structured latent space that ensures style and topology consistency. By integrating these strengths, AvatarTex achieves high-quality topology-aligned texture synthesis with both artistic and geometric coherence. Specifically, our three-stage pipeline first completes missing texture regions via diffusion-based inpainting, refines style and structure consistency using GAN-based latent optimization, and enhances fine details through diffusion-based repainting. To address the need for a stylized texture dataset, we introduce TexHub, a high-resolution collection of 20,000 multi-style UV textures with precise UV-aligned layouts. By leveraging TexHub and our structured diffusion-to-GAN pipeline, AvatarTex establishes a new state-of-the-art in multi-style facial texture reconstruction. TexHub will be released upon publication to facilitate future research in this field.",

Building on the success of Deepseek-R1, researchers extended multimodal reasoning to post-training paradigms based on reinforcement learning (RL), focusing predominantly on mathematical datasets. However, existing post-training paradigms tend to neglect two critical aspects: (1) The lack of quantifiable difficulty metrics capable of strategically screening samples for post-training optimization. (2) Suboptimal post-training paradigms that fail to jointly optimize perception and reasoning capabilities. To address this gap, we propose two novel difficulty-aware sampling strategies: Progressive Image Semantic Masking (PISM) quantifies sample hardness through systematic image degradation, while Cross-Modality Attention Balance (CMAB) assesses cross-modal interaction complexity via attention distribution analysis. Leveraging these metrics, we design a hierarchical training framework that incorporates both GRPO-only and SFT+GRPO hybrid training paradigms, and evaluate them across six benchmark datasets. Experiments demonstrate consistent superiority of GRPO applied to difficulty-stratified samples compared to conventional SFT+GRPO pipelines, indicating that strategic data sampling can obviate the need for supervised fine-tuning while improving model accuracy.

Most of these are diffusion models with unique computational characteristics, distinct from both traditional small-scale ML models and large language models. They are highly compute-bound and use an iterative denoising process to generate images, leading to very high inference time. This creates significant challenges in designing a high-throughput system. We discovered that a large fraction of prompts can be served using faster, approximated models. However, the approximation setting must be carefully calibrated for each prompt to avoid quality degradation. Designing a high-throughput system that assigns each prompt to the appropriate model and compatible approximation setting remains a challenging problem. We present Argus, a high-throughput T2I inference system that selects the right level of approximation for each prompt to maintain quality while meeting throughput targets on a fixed-size cluster. Argus intelligently switches between different approximation strategies to satisfy both throughput and quality requirements. Overall, Argus achieves 10x fewer latency service-level objective (SLO) violations, 10% higher average quality, and 40% higher throughput compared to baselines on two real-world workload traces.",

Existing datasets often overlook two critical characteristics of real rainy 3D scenes: the viewpoint-dependent variation in the appearance of rain streaks caused by their projection onto 2D images, and the reduction in ambient brightness resulting from cloud coverage during rainfall. To improve data realism, we construct a new dataset named OmniRain3D that incorporates perspective heterogeneity and brightness dynamicity, enabling more faithful simulation of rain degradation in 3D scenes. Based on this dataset, we propose an end-to-end reconstruction framework named REVR-GSNet (Rain Elimination and Visibility Recovery for 3D Gaussian Splatting).

However, without a global understanding of both subjects and background, recognizing actions in such samples remains challenging because of the background distractions. Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV), which learns interaction between various dimensions, shows promise for global modeling. While directly applying RWKV to wide-angle FSAR may fail to highlight subjects due to excessive background information. Additionally, temporal relation degraded by frames with similar backgrounds is difficult to reconstruct, further impacting performance. Therefore, we design the CompOund SegmenTation and Temporal REconstructing RWKV (Otter). Specifically, the Compound Segmentation Module~(CSM) is devised to segment and emphasize key patches in each frame, effectively highlighting subjects against background information. The Temporal Reconstruction Module (TRM) is incorporated into the temporal-enhanced prototype construction to enable bidirectional scanning, allowing better reconstruct temporal relation. Furthermore, a regular prototype is combined with the temporal-enhanced prototype to simultaneously enhance subject emphasis and temporal modeling, improving wide-angle FSAR performance. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as SSv2, Kinetics, UCF101, and HMDB51 demonstrate that Otter achieves state-of-the-art performance. Extra evaluation on the VideoBadminton dataset further validates the superiority of Otter in wide-angle FSAR.",

Recently, the integration of flow matching generative models into image restoration has garnered significant attention, owing to their powerful prior modeling capabilities. In this work, we incorporate such generative priors into a Plug-and-Play (PnP) framework based on proximal splitting, where the proximal operator associated with the regularizer is replaced by a time-dependent denoiser derived from the generative model. While existing PnP methods have achieved notable success in inverse problems with smooth squared $\\ell_2$ data fidelity--typically associated with Gaussian noise--their applicability to more general data fidelity terms remains underexplored. To address this, we propose a general and efficient PnP algorithm inspired by the primal-dual hybrid gradient (PDHG) method. Our approach is computationally efficient, memory-friendly, and accommodates a wide range of fidelity terms. In particular, it supports both $\\ell_1$ and $\\ell_2$ norm-based losses, enabling robustness to non-Gaussian noise types such as Poisson and impulse noise. We validate our method on several image restoration tasks, including denoising, super-resolution, deblurring, and inpainting, and demonstrate that $\\ell_1$ and $\\ell_2$ fidelity terms outperform the conventional squared $\\ell_2$ loss in the presence of non-Gaussian noise.",

Existing traditional methods are based on hand-crafted features, which lack flexibility and rely entirely on fixed priors, while the scarcity of paired training data critically hampers deep learning. To address this issue, we propose a novel network built upon decoupled HSV Look-Up Tables (LUTs). The method aims to simplify color correction by adjusting the Hue (H), Saturation (S), and Value (V) components independently. This approach resolves the inherent color coupling problems in traditional methods. Our model adopts a two-stage architecture: First, a Chroma-Aware Spectral Tokenizer (CAST) converts the input image from RGB space to HSV space and independently encodes the Hue (H) and Value (V) channels into a set of semantic tokens describing the Purple flare status; second, the HSV-LUT module takes these tokens as input and dynamically generates independent correction curves (1D-LUTs) for the three channels H, S, and V. To effectively train and validate our model, we built the first large-scale purple flare dataset with diverse scenes. We also proposed new metrics and a loss function specifically designed for this task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model not only significantly outperforms existing methods in visual effects but also achieves state-of-the-art performance on all quantitative metrics.",

To address the issues of unstable pose estimation and scene representation distortion caused by geometric texture inconsistency in large outdoor scenes with weak or repetitive textures, we approach the problem from two aspects: pose estimation and scene representation. For pose estimation, we leverage LiDAR-IMU Odometry to provide prior poses for cameras in large-scale environments. These prior pose constraints are incorporated into COLMAP's triangulation process, with pose optimization performed via bundle adjustment. Ensuring consistency between pixel data association and prior poses helps maintain both robustness and accuracy. For scene representation, we introduce normal vector constraints and effective rank regularization to enforce consistency in the direction and shape of Gaussian primitives. These constraints are jointly optimized with the existing photometric loss to enhance the map quality. We evaluate our approach using both public and self-collected datasets. In terms of pose optimization, our method requires only one-third of the time while maintaining accuracy and robustness across both datasets. In terms of scene representation, the results show that our method significantly outperforms conventional 3DGS pipelines. Notably, on self-collected datasets characterized by weak or repetitive textures, our approach demonstrates enhanced visualization capabilities and achieves superior overall performance.

ConeGS first creates a fast Instant Neural Graphics Primitives (iNGP) reconstruction as a geometric proxy to estimate per-pixel depth. During the subsequent 3DGS optimization, it identifies high-error pixels and inserts new Gaussians along the corresponding viewing cones at the predicted depth values, initializing their size according to the cone diameter. A pre-activation opacity penalty rapidly removes redundant Gaussians, while a primitive budgeting strategy controls the total number of primitives, either by a fixed budget or by adapting to scene complexity, ensuring high reconstruction quality. Experiments show that ConeGS consistently enhances reconstruction quality and rendering performance across Gaussian budgets, with especially strong gains under tight primitive constraints where efficient placement is crucial.",

        "abstract": "Stereo matching in minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is essential for next-generation navigation and augmented reality. Yet, dense disparity supervision is nearly impossible due to anatomical constraints, typically limiting annotations to only a few image-level labels acquired before the endoscope enters deep body cavities. Teacher-Student Learning (TSL) offers a promising solution by leveraging a teacher trained on sparse labels to generate pseudo labels and associated confidence maps from abundant unlabeled surgical videos. However, existing TSL methods are confined to image-level supervision, providing only spatial confidence and lacking temporal consistency estimation. This absence of spatio-temporal reliability results in unstable disparity predictions and severe flickering artifacts across video frames. To overcome these challenges, we propose TiS-TSL, a novel time-switchable teacher-student learning framework for video stereo matching under minimal supervision. At its core is a unified model that operates in three distinct modes: Image-Prediction (IP), Forward Video-Prediction (FVP), and Backward Video-Prediction (BVP), enabling flexible temporal modeling within a single architecture. Enabled by this unified model, TiS-TSL adopts a two-stage learning strategy. The Image-to-Video (I2V) stage transfers sparse image-level knowledge to initialize temporal modeling. The subsequent Video-to-Video (V2V) stage refines temporal disparity predictions by comparing forward and backward predictions to calculate bidirectional spatio-temporal consistency. This consistency identifies unreliable regions across frames, filters noisy video-level pseudo labels, and enforces temporal coherence. Experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate that TiS-TSL exceeds other image-based state-of-the-arts by improving TEPE and EPE by at least 2.11% and 4.54%, respectively..",

Recently, denoisers induced by generative priors have been successfully integrated into regularized optimization methods for image restoration under Gaussian noise. However, their application to non-Gaussian noise--such as impulse noise--remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a plug-and-play image restoration framework based on generative diffusion priors for robust removal of general noise types, including impulse noise. Within the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation framework, the data fidelity term is adapted to the specific noise model. Departing from the conventional least-squares loss used for Gaussian noise, we introduce a generalized Gaussian scale mixture-based loss, which approximates a wide range of noise distributions and leads to an $\\ell_q$-norm ($0<q\\leq2$) fidelity term. This optimization problem is addressed using an iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) approach, wherein the proximal step involving the generative prior is efficiently performed via a diffusion-based denoiser. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method effectively removes non-Gaussian impulse noise and achieves superior restoration performance.",

Based on it, we also construct a novel GS quality assessment dataset named MUGSQA, which is constructed considering multiple uncertainties of the input data. These uncertainties include the quantity and resolution of input views, the view distance, and the accuracy of the initial point cloud. Moreover, we construct two benchmarks: one to evaluate the robustness of various GS-based reconstruction methods under multiple uncertainties, and the other to evaluate the performance of existing quality assessment metrics.

Current approaches, however, remain constrained by the scarcity of high-quality stimulus-brain response pairs and the inherent semantic mismatch between neural representations and visual content. Inspired by perceptual variability and co-adaptive strategy of the biological systems, we propose a novel self-supervised architecture, named NeuroBridge, which integrates Cognitive Prior Augmentation (CPA) with Shared Semantic Projector (SSP) to promote effective cross-modality alignment. Specifically, CPA simulates perceptual variability by applying asymmetric, modality-specific transformations to both EEG signals and images, enhancing semantic diversity. Unlike previous approaches, SSP establishes a bidirectional alignment process through a co-adaptive strategy, which mutually aligns features from two modalities into a shared semantic space for effective cross-modal learning. NeuroBridge surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods under both intra-subject and inter-subject settings. In the intra-subject scenario, it achieves the improvements of 12.3% in top-1 accuracy and 10.2% in top-5 accuracy, reaching 63.2% and 89.9% respectively on a 200-way zero-shot retrieval task.

One of the main challenges is to stitch together multiple images into a single high-resolution image that covers a large area. Featurebased image stitching algorithms are commonly used but can suffer from errors and ambiguities in feature detection and matching. To address this, several approaches have been proposed, including using bundle adjustment techniques or direct image alignment. In this paper, we present a novel method that uses a combination of IMU data and computer vision techniques for stitching images captured by a UAV. Our method involves several steps such as estimating the displacement and rotation of the UAV between consecutive images, correcting for perspective distortion, and computing a homography matrix. We then use a standard image stitching algorithm to align and blend the images together. Our proposed method leverages the additional information provided by the IMU data, corrects for various sources of distortion, and can be easily integrated into existing UAV workflows. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method, outperforming some of the existing feature-based image stitching algorithms in terms of accuracy and reliability, particularly in challenging scenarios such as large displacements, rotations, and variations in camera pose.",

We provide the first comprehensive analysis of this phenomenon through a novel analytical framework termed as ``distillation dynamics\", combining frequency spectrum analysis, information entropy metrics, and activation magnitude tracking. Our investigation reveals that ViTs exhibit a distinctive U-shaped information processing pattern: initial compression followed by expansion. We identify the root cause of negative transfer in feature distillation: a fundamental representational paradigm mismatch between teacher and student models. Through frequency-domain analysis, we show that teacher models employ distributed, high-dimensional encoding strategies in later layers that smaller student models cannot replicate due to limited channel capacity. This mismatch causes late-layer feature alignment to actively harm student performance. Our findings reveal that successful knowledge transfer in ViTs requires moving beyond naive feature mimicry to methods that respect these fundamental representational constraints, providing essential theoretical guidance for designing effective ViTs compression strategies.

To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose Ambiguity-aware Truncated Flow Matching (ATFM), which introduces a novel inference paradigm and dedicated model components. Firstly, we propose Data-Hierarchical Inference, a redefinition of AMIS-specific inference paradigm, which enhances accuracy and diversity at data-distribution and data-sample level, respectively, for an effective disentanglement. Secondly, Gaussian Truncation Representation (GTR) is introduced to enhance both fidelity of predictions and reliability of truncation distribution, by explicitly modeling it as a Gaussian distribution at $T_{\\text{trunc}}$ instead of using sampling-based this http URL, Segmentation Flow Matching (SFM) is proposed to enhance the plausibility of diverse predictions by extending semantic-aware flow transformation in Flow Matching (FM).

These issues lead to unstable codeword learning and underutilized codebooks, ultimately degrading the performance of both reconstruction and downstream generation tasks. To this end, we propose VAEVQ, which comprises three key components: (1) Variational Latent Quantization (VLQ), replacing the AE with a VAE for quantization to leverage its structured and smooth latent space, thereby facilitating more effective codeword activation; (2) Representation Coherence Strategy (RCS), adaptively modulating the alignment strength between pre- and post-quantization features to enhance consistency and prevent overfitting to noise; and (3) Distribution Consistency Regularization (DCR), aligning the entire codebook distribution with the continuous latent distribution to improve utilization.

        "abstract": "Text-to-image models have rapidly evolved from casual creative tools to professional-grade systems, achieving unprecedented levels of image quality and realism. Yet, most models are trained to map short prompts into detailed images, creating a gap between sparse textual input and rich visual outputs. This mismatch reduces controllability, as models often fill in missing details arbitrarily, biasing toward average user preferences and limiting precision for professional use. We address this limitation by training the first open-source text-to-image model on long structured captions, where every training sample is annotated with the same set of fine-grained attributes. This design maximizes expressive coverage and enables disentangled control over visual factors. To process long captions efficiently, we propose DimFusion, a fusion mechanism that integrates intermediate tokens from a lightweight LLM without increasing token length. We also introduce the Text-as-a-Bottleneck Reconstruction (TaBR) evaluation protocol. By assessing how well real images can be reconstructed through a captioning-generation loop, TaBR directly measures controllability and expressiveness, even for very long captions where existing evaluation methods fail. Finally, we demonstrate our contributions by training the large-scale model FIBO, achieving state-of-the-art prompt alignment among open-source models.

        "abstract": "Text-to-image diffusion models exhibit remarkable generative capabilities, but lack precise control over object counts and spatial arrangements. This work introduces a two-stage system to address these compositional limitations. The first stage employs a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate a structured layout from a list of objects. The second stage uses a layout-conditioned diffusion model to synthesize a photorealistic image adhering to this layout. We find that task decomposition is critical for LLM-based spatial planning; by simplifying the initial generation to core objects and completing the layout with rule-based insertion, we improve object recall from 57.2% to 99.9% for complex scenes. For image synthesis, we compare two leading conditioning methods: ControlNet and GLIGEN. After domain-specific finetuning on table-setting datasets, we identify a key trade-off: ControlNet preserves text-based stylistic control but suffers from object hallucination, while GLIGEN provides superior layout fidelity at the cost of reduced prompt-based controllability. Our end-to-end system successfully generates images with specified object counts and plausible spatial arrangements, demonstrating the viability of a decoupled approach for compositionally controlled synthesis.",

However, their reliance on fixed-size rectangular patches often influences the integrity of complex vascular structures, leading to suboptimal segmentation accuracy. To address this challenge, we propose the adaptive Morph Patch Transformer (MPT), a novel architecture specifically designed for aortic vascular segmentation. Specifically, MPT introduces an adaptive patch partitioning strategy that dynamically generates morphology-aware patches aligned with complex vascular structures. This strategy can preserve semantic integrity of complex vascular structures within individual patches. Moreover, a Semantic Clustering Attention (SCA) method is proposed to dynamically aggregate features from various patches with similar semantic characteristics. This method enhances the model's capability to segment vessels of varying sizes, preserving the integrity of vascular structures. Extensive experiments on three open-source dataset(AVT, AortaSeg24 and TBAD) demonstrate that MPT achieves state-of-the-art performance, with improvements in segmenting intricate vascular structures.",

In this experiment, we classify colorless microplastic particles (50-300 $\\mu$m) by illuminating them with linearly polarized laser light and capturing their reflected signals using a polarization-sensitive camera. This reflection-based technique successfully circumvents the transmission-based interference issues that plague many conventional methods when applied in water. Using a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) for image-based classification, we successfully identified three common polymer types, high-density polyethylene, low-density polyethylene, and polypropylene, achieving a peak mean classification accuracy of 80% on the test dataset. A subsequent feature hierarchy analysis demonstrated that the CNN's decision-making process relies mainly on the microstructural integrity and internal texture (polarization patterns) of the particle rather than its macroshape. Critically, we found that the Angle of Linear Polarization (AOLP) signal is significantly more robust against contextual noise than the Degree of Linear Polarization (DOLP) signal. While the AOLP-based classification achieved superior overall performance, its strength lies in distinguishing between the two polyethylene plastics, showing a lower confusion rate between high-density and low-density polyethylene. Conversely, the DOLP signal demonstrated slightly worse overall classification results but excels at accurately identifying the polypropylene class, which it isolated with greater success than AOLP.",

        "abstract": "Monocular 3D Visual Grounding (Mono3DVG) is an emerging task that locates 3D objects in RGB images using text descriptions with geometric cues. However, existing methods face two key limitations. Firstly, they often over-rely on high-certainty keywords that explicitly identify the target object while neglecting critical spatial descriptions. Secondly, generalized textual features contain both 2D and 3D descriptive information, thereby capturing an additional dimension of details compared to singular 2D or 3D visual features. This characteristic leads to cross-dimensional interference when refining visual features under text guidance. To overcome these challenges, we propose Mono3DVG-EnSD, a novel framework that integrates two key components: the CLIP-Guided Lexical Certainty Adapter (CLIP-LCA) and the Dimension-Decoupled Module (D2M). The CLIP-LCA dynamically masks high-certainty keywords while retaining low-certainty implicit spatial descriptions, thereby forcing the model to develop a deeper understanding of spatial relationships in captions for object localization. Meanwhile, the D2M decouples dimension-specific (2D/3D) textual features from generalized textual features to guide corresponding visual features at same dimension, which mitigates cross-dimensional interference by ensuring dimensionally-consistent cross-modal interactions. Through comprehensive comparisons and ablation studies on the Mono3DRefer dataset, our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across all metrics. Notably, it improves the challenging Far(Acc@0.5) scenario by a significant +13.54%.",

In this study, we introduce PlantTraitNet, a multi-modal, multi-task uncertainty-aware deep learning framework that predictsfour key plant traits (plant height, leaf area, specific leaf area, and nitrogen content) from citizen science photos using weak supervision. By aggregating individual trait predictions across space, we generate global maps of trait distributions. We validate these maps against independent vegetation survey data (sPlotOpen) and benchmark them against leading global trait products. Our results show that PlantTraitNet consistently outperforms existing trait maps across all evaluated traits, demonstrating that citizen science imagery, when integrated with computer vision and geospatial AI, enables not only scalable but also more accurate global trait mapping.

In response, we propose ALIGN, a novel framework that jointly trains a classifier and a masker in an iterative manner. The masker learns to produce soft, task-relevant masks that highlight informative regions, while the classifier is optimized for both prediction accuracy and alignment between its saliency maps and the learned masks. By leveraging high-quality masks as guidance, ALIGN improves both interpretability and generalizability, showing its superiority across various settings. Experiments on the two domain generalization benchmarks, VLCS and Terra Incognita, show that ALIGN consistently outperforms six strong baselines in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings. Besides, ALIGN also yields superior explanation quality concerning sufficiency and comprehensiveness, highlighting its effectiveness in producing accurate and interpretable models.",

However, such a CLIP-based metric is vulnerable for its delicate multimodal alignment. In this work, we propose \\textbf{FoCLIP}, a feature-space misalignment framework for fooling CLIP-based image quality metric. Based on the stochastic gradient descent technique, FoCLIP integrates three key components to construct fooling examples: feature alignment as the core module to reduce image-text modality gaps, the score distribution balance module and pixel-guard regularization, which collectively optimize multimodal output equilibrium between CLIPscore performance and image quality. Such a design can be engineered to maximize the CLIPscore predictions across diverse input prompts, despite exhibiting either visual unrecognizability or semantic incongruence with the corresponding adversarial prompts from human perceptual perspectives. Experiments on ten artistic masterpiece prompts and ImageNet subsets demonstrate that optimized images can achieve significant improvement in CLIPscore while preserving high visual fidelity. In addition, we found that grayscale conversion induces significant feature degradation in fooling images, exhibiting noticeable CLIPscore reduction while preserving statistical consistency with original images. Inspired by this phenomenon, we propose a color channel sensitivity-driven tampering detection mechanism that achieves 91% accuracy on standard benchmarks. In conclusion, this work establishes a practical pathway for feature misalignment in CLIP-based multimodal systems and the corresponding defense method.",

Building on this premise, we propose a content-adaptive framework, GFix, comprising a streamlined, single-step diffusion model that serves as an off-the-shelf neural enhancer. Moreover, to increase compression efficiency, We propose a modulated LoRA scheme that freezes the low-rank decompositions and modulates the intermediate hidden states, thereby achieving efficient adaptation of the diffusion backbone with highly compressible updates.

Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) with Vision Transformer backbones have recently shown strong potential for histopathology representation learning. However, conventional random patch sampling during MAE pretraining often includes irrelevant or noisy regions, limiting the model's ability to capture meaningful tissue patterns. In this paper, we present a lightweight and domain-adapted framework that brings structure and biological relevance into MAE-based learning through a wavelet-informed patch selection strategy. WISE-MAE applies a two-step coarse-to-fine process: wavelet-based screening at low magnification to locate structurally rich regions, followed by high-resolution extraction for detailed modeling. This approach mirrors the diagnostic workflow of pathologists and improves the quality of learned representations. Evaluations across multiple cancer datasets, including lung, renal, and colorectal tissues, show that WISE-MAE achieves competitive representation quality and downstream classification performance while maintaining efficiency under weak supervision.",

        "abstract": "Diabetic retinopathy (DR), a microvascular complication of diabetes and a leading cause of preventable blindness, is projected to affect more than 130 million individuals worldwide by 2030. Early identification is essential to reduce irreversible vision loss, yet current diagnostic workflows rely on methods such as fundus photography and expert review, which remain costly and resource-intensive. This, combined with DR's asymptomatic nature, results in its underdiagnosis rate of approximately 25 percent. Although convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated strong performance in medical imaging tasks, limited interpretability and the absence of uncertainty quantification restrict clinical reliability. Therefore, in this study, a deep ensemble learning framework integrated with uncertainty estimation is introduced to improve robustness, transparency, and scalability in DR detection. The ensemble incorporates seven CNN architectures-ResNet-50, DenseNet-121, MobileNetV3 (Small and Large), and EfficientNet (B0, B2, B3)- whose outputs are fused through an accuracy-weighted majority voting strategy. A probability-weighted entropy metric quantifies prediction uncertainty, enabling low-confidence samples to be excluded or flagged for additional review. Training and validation on 35,000 EyePACS retinal fundus images produced an unfiltered accuracy of 93.70 percent (F1 = 0.9376). Uncertainty-filtering later was conducted to remove unconfident samples, resulting in maximum-accuracy of 99.44 percent (F1 = 0.9932). The framework shows that uncertainty-aware, accuracy-weighted ensembling improves reliability without hindering performance. With confidence-calibrated outputs and a tunable accuracy-coverage trade-off, it offers a generalizable paradigm for deploying trustworthy AI diagnostics in high-risk care.",

With the growing excitement around using AI agents to automate important scientific tasks, we explore whether current AI systems can perform multiple tasks necessary for data proofreading. We introduce ConnectomeBench, a multimodal benchmark evaluating large language model (LLM) capabilities in three critical proofreading tasks: segment type identification, split error correction, and merge error detection. Using expert annotated data from two large open-source datasets - a cubic millimeter of mouse visual cortex and the complete Drosophila brain - we evaluate proprietary multimodal LLMs including Claude 3.7/4 Sonnet, o4-mini, GPT-4.1, GPT-4o, as well as open source models like InternVL-3 and NVLM. Our results demonstrate that current models achieve surprisingly high performance in segment identification (52-82% balanced accuracy vs. 20-25% chance) and binary/multiple choice split error correction (75-85% accuracy vs. 50% chance) while generally struggling on merge error identification tasks. Overall, while the best models still lag behind expert performance, they demonstrate promising capabilities that could eventually enable them to augment and potentially replace human proofreading in connectomics.

Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) addresses this by optimizing for the worst-case risk within a neighborhood of the training distribution. However, conventional methods depend on a single, global robustness budget, which can lead to overly conservative models or a misallocation of robustness. We propose a variance-driven, adaptive, sample-level DRO (Var-DRO) framework that automatically identifies high-risk training samples and assigns a personalized robustness budget to each based on its online loss variance. Our formulation employs two-sided, KL-divergence-style bounds to constrain the ratio between adversarial and empirical weights for every sample. This results in a linear inner maximization problem over a convex polytope, which admits an efficient water-filling solution. To stabilize training, we introduce a warmup phase and a linear ramp schedule for the global cap on per-sample budgets, complemented by label smoothing for numerical robustness. Evaluated on CIFAR-10-C (corruptions), our method achieves the highest overall mean accuracy compared to ERM and KL-DRO. On Waterbirds, Var-DRO improves overall performance while matching or surpassing KL-DRO. On the original CIFAR-10 dataset, Var-DRO remains competitive, exhibiting the modest trade-off anticipated when prioritizing robustness. The proposed framework is unsupervised (requiring no group labels), straightforward to implement, theoretically sound, and computationally efficient.",

In this paper, we propose MARAuder's Map, a novel framework for real-time activity recognition from raw, unsegmented sensor streams. Our method projects sensor activations onto the physical floorplan to generate trajectory-aware, image-like sequences that capture the spatial flow of human movement. These representations are processed by a hybrid deep learning model that jointly captures spatial structure and temporal dependencies. To enhance temporal awareness, we introduce a learnable time embedding module that encodes contextual cues such as hour-of-day and day-of-week. Additionally, an attention-based encoder selectively focuses on informative segments within each observation window, enabling accurate recognition even under cross-activity transitions and temporal ambiguity. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world smart home datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms strong baselines, offering a practical solution for real-time HAR in ambient sensor environments.",

However, most ICM frameworks utilize learned image compression (LIC) models that operate at a fixed rate and require separate training for each target bitrate, which may limit their practical applications. Existing variable rate LIC approaches mitigate this limitation but typically depend on training, increasing computational cost and deployment complexity. Moreover, variable rate control has not been thoroughly explored for ICM. To address these challenges, we propose a training-free, adaptive quantization step size control scheme that enables flexible bitrate adjustment. By leveraging both channel-wise entropy dependencies and spatial scale parameters predicted by the hyperprior network, the proposed method preserves semantically important regions while coarsely quantizing less critical areas. The bitrate can be continuously controlled through a single parameter. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving up to 11.07% BD-rate savings over the non-adaptive variable rate method.",

Through controlled experiments on SwinIR, we uncover a striking asymmetry: weight quantization primarily degrades structural similarity, while activation quantization disproportionately affects pixel-level accuracy. This stems from their distinct roles--weights encode learned restoration priors for textures and edges, whereas activations carry input-specific intensity information. Building on this insight, we propose HarmoQ, a unified framework that harmonizes quantization across components through three synergistic steps: structural residual calibration proactively adjusts weights to compensate for activation-induced detail loss, harmonized scale optimization analytically balances quantization difficulty via closed-form solutions, and adaptive boundary refinement iteratively maintains this balance during optimization. Experiments show HarmoQ achieves substantial gains under aggressive compression, outperforming prior art by 0.46 dB on Set5 at 2-bit while delivering 3.2x speedup and 4x memory reduction on A100 GPUs. This work provides the first systematic analysis of weight-activation coupling in super-resolution quantization and establishes a principled solution for efficient high-quality image restoration.",

Although Deep Learning (DL) has driven advances in Presentation Attack Detection (PAD), the field is fundamentally limited by a lack of data and the poor generalisation of models across various document types and new attack methods. This article presents a systematic literature review (SLR) conducted in accordance with the PRISMA methodology, aiming to analyse and synthesise the current state of AI-based PAD for identity documents from 2020 to 2025 comprehensively. Our analysis reveals a significant methodological evolution: a transition from standard Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to specialised forensic micro-artefact analysis, and more recently, the adoption of large-scale Foundation Models (FMs), marking a substantial shift in the field. We identify a central paradox that hinders progress: a critical \"Reality Gap\" exists between models validated on extensive, private datasets and those assessed using limited public datasets, which typically consist of mock-ups or synthetic data. This gap limits the reproducibility of research results. Additionally, we highlight a \"Synthetic Utility Gap,\" where synthetic data generation the primary academic response to data scarcity often fails to predict forensic utility. This can lead to model overfitting to generation artefacts instead of the actual attack. This review consolidates our findings, identifies critical research gaps, and provides a definitive reference framework that outlines a prescriptive roadmap for future research aimed at developing secure, robust, and globally generalizable PAD systems.",

The current analysis works use image captioning tasks and visual question answering. In this work, we propose using the Referring Expression Comprehension task instead as a platform for the evaluation of spatial reasoning by VLMs. This platform provides the opportunity for a deeper analysis of spatial comprehension and grounding abilities when there is 1) ambiguity in object detection, 2) complex spatial expressions with a longer sentence structure and multiple spatial relations, and 3) expressions with negation ('not'). In our analysis, we use task-specific architectures as well as large VLMs and highlight their strengths and weaknesses in dealing with these specific situations. While all these models face challenges with the task at hand, the relative behaviors depend on the underlying models and the specific categories of spatial semantics (topological, directional, proximal, etc.).

Diagnosing ADHD using neuroimaging data, however, remains challenging due to heterogeneous presentations and overlapping symptoms with other conditions. To address this, we propose a novel parameter-efficient transfer learning approach that adapts a large-scale 3D convolutional foundation model, pre-trained on CT images, to an MRI-based ADHD classification task. Our method introduces Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) in 3D by factorizing 3D convolutional kernels into 2D low-rank updates, dramatically reducing trainable parameters while achieving superior performance. In a five-fold cross-validated evaluation on a public diffusion MRI database, our 3D LoRA fine-tuning strategy achieved state-of-the-art results, with one model variant reaching 71.9% accuracy and another attaining an AUC of 0.716. Both variants use only 1.64 million trainable parameters (over 113x fewer than a fully fine-tuned foundation model). Our results represent one of the first successful cross-modal (CT-to-MRI) adaptations of a foundation model in neuroimaging, establishing a new benchmark for ADHD classification while greatly improving efficiency.",

However, such models suffer from approximation errors introduced by efficiency techniques, which significantly degrade generation quality. Once deployed, these errors are difficult to correct, as modifying the model is typically infeasible in deployment environments. Through an analysis of error propagation across diffusion timesteps, we reveal that these approximation errors can accumulate exponentially, severely impairing output quality. Motivated by this insight, we propose Iterative Error Correction (IEC), a novel test-time method that mitigates inference-time errors by iteratively refining the model's output. IEC is theoretically proven to reduce error propagation from exponential to linear growth, without requiring any retraining or architectural changes. IEC can seamlessly integrate into the inference process of existing diffusion models, enabling a flexible trade-off between performance and efficiency. Extensive experiments show that IEC consistently improves generation quality across various datasets, efficiency techniques, and model architectures, establishing it as a practical and generalizable solution for test-time enhancement of efficient diffusion models.",

For efficient deployment of these algorithms, although different techniques for the compression of neural network models are proposed, neural pruning is one of the fastest and effective methods, which can provide a high compression gain with minimal cost. To harness enhanced performance gain with respect to model complexity, we propose a novel neural network pruning approach utilizing Hessian-vector products that approximate crucial curvature information in the loss function, which significantly reduces the computation demands. By employing a power iteration method, our algorithm effectively identifies and preserves the essential information, ensuring a balanced trade-off between model accuracy and computational efficiency. Herein, we introduce CAMP-HiVe, a cyclic pair merging-based pruning with Hessian Vector approximation by iteratively consolidating weight pairs, combining significant and less significant weights, thus effectively streamlining the model while preserving its performance. This dynamic, adaptive framework allows for real-time adjustment of weight significance, ensuring that only the most critical parameters are retained. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves significant reductions in computational requirements while maintaining high performance across different neural network architectures, e.g., ResNet18, ResNet56, and MobileNetv2, on standard benchmark datasets, e.g., CIFAR10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, and it outperforms the existing state-of-the-art neural pruning methods.",

The ability to perceive, track, and manipulate these objects without prior knowledge of their geometry or kinematic properties remains a fundamental challenge in robotics. In this work, we present a novel method for visuo-tactile-based tracking of unseen objects (single, multiple, or articulated) during robotic interaction without assuming any prior knowledge regarding object shape or dynamics. Our novel pose tracking approach termed ArtReg (stands for Articulated Registration) integrates visuo-tactile point clouds in an unscented Kalman Filter formulation in the SE(3) Lie Group for point cloud registration. ArtReg is used to detect possible articulated joints in objects using purposeful manipulation maneuvers such as pushing or hold-pulling with a two-robot team. Furthermore, we leverage ArtReg to develop a closed-loop controller for goal-driven manipulation of articulated objects to move the object into the desired pose configuration. We have extensively evaluated our approach on various types of unknown objects through real robot experiments. We also demonstrate the robustness of our method by evaluating objects with varying center of mass, low-light conditions, and with challenging visual backgrounds. Furthermore, we benchmarked our approach on a standard dataset of articulated objects and demonstrated improved performance in terms of pose accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our experiments indicate that robust and accurate pose tracking leveraging visuo-tactile information enables robots to perceive and interact with unseen complex articulated objects (with revolute or prismatic joints).",

This paper presents an efficient zero-shot diffusion-based compression method that runs substantially faster than existing methods, while maintaining performance that is on par with the state-of-the-art techniques. Our method builds upon the recently proposed Denoising Diffusion Codebook Models (DDCMs) compression scheme. Specifically, DDCM compresses an image by sequentially choosing the diffusion noise vectors from reproducible random codebooks, guiding the denoiser's output to reconstruct the target image. We modify this framework with Turbo-DDCM, which efficiently combines a large number of noise vectors at each denoising step, thereby significantly reducing the number of required denoising operations. This modification is also coupled with an improved encoding protocol. Furthermore, we introduce two flexible variants of Turbo-DDCM, a priority-aware variant that prioritizes user-specified regions and a distortion-controlled variant that compresses an image based on a target PSNR rather than a target BPP. Comprehensive experiments position Turbo-DDCM as a compelling, practical, and flexible image compression scheme.",

Current methods often struggle to balance the competing demands of interpretability and model flexibility, limiting their effectiveness in extracting meaningful insights from complex data. We introduce Non-negative Stiefel Approximating Flow (NSA-Flow), a general-purpose matrix estimation framework that unifies ideas from sparse matrix factorization, orthogonalization, and constrained manifold learning. NSA-Flow enforces structured sparsity through a continuous balance between reconstruction fidelity and column-wise decorrelation, parameterized by a single tunable weight. The method operates as a smooth flow near the Stiefel manifold with proximal updates for non-negativity and adaptive gradient control, yielding representations that are simultaneously sparse, stable, and interpretable. Unlike classical regularization schemes, NSA-Flow provides an intuitive geometric mechanism for manipulating sparsity at the level of global structure while simplifying latent features. We demonstrate that the NSA-Flow objective can be optimized smoothly and integrates seamlessly with existing pipelines for dimensionality reduction while improving interpretability and generalization in both simulated and real biomedical data. Empirical validation on the Golub leukemia dataset and in Alzheimer's disease demonstrate that the NSA-Flow constraints can maintain or improve performance over related methods with little additional methodological effort. NSA-Flow offers a scalable, general-purpose tool for interpretable ML, applicable across data science domains.",

This paper proposes a novel self-contained low-rank approach to automatically rank multiple candidate captions generated by multiple VLMs based on their hallucination levels, using only the captions themselves without requiring external references or model access. By constructing a sentence-embedding matrix and decomposing it into a low-rank consensus component and a sparse residual, we use the residual magnitude to rank captions: selecting the one with the smallest residual as the most hallucination-free. Experiments on the NuScenes dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves 87% selection accuracy in identifying hallucination-free captions, representing a 19% improvement over the unfiltered baseline and a 6-10% improvement over multi-agent debate method. The sorting produced by sparse error magnitudes shows strong correlation with human judgments of hallucinations, validating our scoring mechanism.

However, current approaches for robot relative localization are primarily realized in the form of distributed multi-robot SLAM systems with the same sensor configuration, which are tightly coupled with the state estimation of all robots, limiting both flexibility and accuracy. To this end, we fully leverage the high capacity of Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) to integrate multiple sensors, enabling a semi-distributed cross-modal air-ground relative localization framework. In this work, both the UGV and the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) independently perform SLAM while extracting deep learning-based keypoints and global descriptors, which decouples the relative localization from the state estimation of all agents. The UGV employs a local Bundle Adjustment (BA) with LiDAR, camera, and an IMU to rapidly obtain accurate relative pose estimates. The BA process adopts sparse keypoint optimization and is divided into two stages: First, optimizing camera poses interpolated from LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO), followed by estimating the relative camera poses between the UGV and UAV. Additionally, we implement an incremental loop closure detection algorithm using deep learning-based descriptors to maintain and retrieve keyframes efficiently. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves outstanding performance in both accuracy and efficiency. Unlike traditional multi-robot SLAM approaches that transmit images or point clouds, our method only transmits keypoint pixels and their descriptors, effectively constraining the communication bandwidth under 0.3 Mbps.

Therefore, Spectral Deconvolution imaging (SDI) methods based on PSF engineering have been proposed to achieve high-fidelity compact CSI design recently. However, the composite convolution-integration operations of SDI render the normal-equation coefficient matrix scene-dependent, which hampers the efficient exploitation of imaging priors and poses challenges for accurate reconstruction. To tackle the inherent data-dependent operators in SDI, we introduce a Hierarchical Spatial-Spectral Aggregation Unfolding Framework (HSFAUF). By decomposing subproblems and projecting them into the frequency domain, HSFAUF transforms nonlinear processes into linear mappings, thereby enabling efficient solutions. Furthermore, to integrate spatial-spectral priors during iterative refinement, we propose a Spatial-Frequency Aggregation Transformer (SFAT), which explicitly aggregates information across spatial and frequency domains.

        "abstract": "Inspired by how humans reason over discrete objects and their relationships, we explore whether compact object-centric and object-relation representations can form a foundation for multitask robotic manipulation. Most existing robotic multitask models rely on dense embeddings that entangle both object and background cues, raising concerns about both efficiency and interpretability. In contrast, we study object-relation-centric representations as a pathway to more structured, efficient, and explainable visuomotor control. Our contributions are two-fold. First, we introduce LIBERO+, a fine-grained benchmark dataset designed to enable and evaluate object-relation reasoning in robotic manipulation. Unlike prior datasets, LIBERO+ provides object-centric annotations that enrich demonstrations with box- and mask-level labels as well as instance-level temporal tracking, supporting compact and interpretable visuomotor representations. Second, we propose SlotVLA, a slot-attention-based framework that captures both objects and their relations for action decoding. It uses a slot-based visual tokenizer to maintain consistent temporal object representations, a relation-centric decoder to produce task-relevant embeddings, and an LLM-driven module that translates these embeddings into executable actions. Experiments on LIBERO+ demonstrate that object-centric slot and object-relation slot representations drastically reduce the number of required visual tokens, while providing competitive generalization. Together, LIBERO+ and SlotVLA provide a compact, interpretable, and effective foundation for advancing object-relation-centric robotic manipulation.",

        "abstract": "Background and Objective: Colorectal cancer prevention relies on early detection of polyps during colonoscopy. Existing public datasets, such as CVC-ClinicDB and Kvasir-SEG, provide valuable benchmarks but are limited by small sample sizes, curated image selection, or lack of real-world artifacts. There remains a need for datasets that capture the complexity of clinical practice, particularly in resource-constrained settings. Methods: We introduce a dataset, BUET Polyp Dataset (BPD), of colonoscopy images collected using Olympus 170 and Pen- tax i-Scan series endoscopes under routine clinical conditions. The dataset contains images with corresponding expert-annotated binary masks, reflecting diverse challenges such as motion blur, specular highlights, stool artifacts, blood, and low-light frames. Annotations were manually reviewed by clinical experts to ensure quality. To demonstrate baseline performance, we provide bench- mark results for classification using VGG16, ResNet50, and InceptionV3, and for segmentation using UNet variants with VGG16, ResNet34, and InceptionV4 backbones. Results: The dataset comprises 1,288 images with polyps from 164 patients with corresponding ground-truth masks and 1,657 polyp-free images from 31 patients. Benchmarking experiments achieved up to 90.8% accuracy for binary classification (VGG16) and a maximum Dice score of 0.64 with InceptionV4-UNet for segmentation. Performance was lower compared to curated datasets, reflecting the real-world difficulty of images with artifacts and variable quality.",

        "abstract": "This paper explores the application of vision-based system identification techniques in quadrotor modeling and control. Through experiments and analysis, we address the complexities and limitations of quadrotor modeling, particularly in relation to thrust and drag coefficients. Grey-box modeling is employed to mitigate uncertainties, and the effectiveness of an onboard vision system is evaluated. An LQR controller is designed based on a system identification model using data from the onboard vision system. The results demonstrate consistent performance between the models, validating the efficacy of vision based system identification. This study highlights the potential of vision-based techniques in enhancing quadrotor modeling and control, contributing to improved performance and operational capabilities. Our findings provide insights into the usability and consistency of these techniques, paving the way for future research in quadrotor performance enhancement, fault detection, and decision-making processes.",
