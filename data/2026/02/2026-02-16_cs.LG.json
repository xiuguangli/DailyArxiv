        "abstract": "We want language model assistants to conform to a character specification, which asserts how the model should act across diverse user interactions. While models typically follow these character specifications, they can occasionally violate them in large-scale deployments. In this work, we aim to identify types of queries that are likely to produce such character violations at deployment, using much less than deployment-level compute. To do this, we introduce abstractive red-teaming, where we search for natural-language query categories, e.g. \"The query is in Chinese. The query asks about family roles,\" that routinely elicit violations. These categories abstract over the many possible variants of a query which could appear in the wild. We introduce two algorithms for efficient category search against a character-trait-specific reward model: one based on reinforcement learning on a category generator LLM, and another which leverages a strong LLM to iteratively synthesize categories from high-scoring queries. Across a 12-principle character specification and 7 target models, we find that our algorithms consistently outperform baselines, and generate qualitatively interesting categories; for example, queries which ask Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct to predict the future lead to responses saying that AI will dominate humanity, and queries that ask GPT-4.1-Mini for essential prison survival items lead to enthusiastic recommendation of illegal weapons. Overall, we believe our results represent an important step towards realistic pre-deployment auditing of language model character.",

        "abstract": "The widespread availability of fine-tuned LoRA modules for open pre-trained models has led to an interest in methods that can adaptively merge LoRAs to improve performance. These methods typically include some way of selecting LoRAs from a pool and tune merging coefficients based on a task-specific dataset. While adaptive merging methods have demonstrated improvements in some settings, no past work has attempted to recycle LoRAs found \"in the wild\" on model repositories like the Hugging Face Hub. To address this gap, we consider recycling from a pool of nearly 1,000 user-contributed LoRAs trained from the Llama 3.1 8B-Instruct language model. Our empirical study includes a range of adaptive and non-adaptive merging methods in addition to a new method designed via a wide search over the methodological design space. We demonstrate that adaptive merging methods can improve performance over the base model but provide limited benefit over training a new LoRA on the same data used to set merging coefficients. We additionally find not only that the specific choice of LoRAs to merge has little importance, but that using LoRAs with randomly initialized parameter values yields similar performance. This raises the possibility that adaptive merging from recycled LoRAs primarily works via some kind of regularization effect, rather than by enabling positive cross-task transfer. To better understand why past work has proven successful, we confirm that positive transfer is indeed possible when there are highly relevant LoRAs in the pool. We release the model checkpoints and code online.",

To establish a shared semantic latent space, the transmitters/receivers in TokenCom need to agree on an identical tokenizer model and codebook. To this end, an initial Tokenizer Agreement (TA) process is carried out in each communication episode, where the transmitter/receiver cooperate to choose from a set of pre-trained tokenizer models/ codebooks available to them both for efficient TokenCom. In this correspondence, we investigate TA in a multi-user downlink wireless TokenCom scenario, where the base station equipped with multiple antennas transmits video token streams to multiple users. We formulate the corresponding mixed-integer non-convex problem, and propose a hybrid reinforcement learning (RL) framework that integrates a deep Q-network (DQN) for joint tokenizer agreement and sub-channel assignment, with a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) for beamforming. Simulation results show that the proposed framework outperforms baseline methods in terms of semantic quality and resource efficiency, while reducing the freezing events in video transmission by 68% compared to the conventional H.265-based scheme.",

Our mesh-free physics-informed neural network (PINN) approach directly parametrises the conformal factor globally and is trained with a geometry-aware loss enforcing the curvature equation. Additional consistency checks were performed via the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, and spherical-harmonic expansions were fit to the learnt models to provide interpretability. For prescribed curvatures with known realisability, the neural network achieves very low losses ($10^{-7} - 10^{-10}$), while unrealisable curvatures yield significantly higher losses. This distinction enables the assessment of unknown cases, separating likely realisable functions from non-realisable ones. The current capabilities of the Nirenberg Neural Network demonstrate that neural solvers can serve as exploratory tools in geometric analysis, offering a quantitative computational perspective on longstanding existence questions.",

The agent acts greedily with respect to an estimate of the value plus what can be seen as a value bonus. The value bonus can be learned by estimating a value function on reward bonuses, propagating local uncertainties around rewards. However, this approach only increases the value bonus for an action retroactively, after seeing a higher reward bonus from that state and action. Such an approach does not encourage the agent to visit a state and action for the first time. In this work, we introduce an algorithm for exploration called Value Bonuses with Ensemble errors (VBE), that maintains an ensemble of random action-value functions (RQFs). VBE uses the errors in the estimation of these RQFs to design value bonuses that provide first-visit optimism and deep exploration. The key idea is to design the rewards for these RQFs in such a way that the value bonus can decrease to zero. We show that VBE outperforms Bootstrap DQN and two reward bonus approaches (RND and ACB) on several classic environments used to test exploration and provide demonstrative experiments that it can scale easily to more complex environments like Atari.",

While Iterative Conditional Expectation (ICE) G-computation offers a principled approach, its recursive structure suffers from error propagation, corrupting the learned outcome regression models. We propose D3-Net, a framework that mitigates error propagation in ICE training and then applies a robust final correction. First, to interrupt error propagation during learning, we train the ICE sequence using Sequential Doubly Robust (SDR) pseudo-outcomes, which provide bias-corrected targets for each regression. Second, we employ a multi-task Transformer with a covariate simulator head for auxiliary supervision, regularizing representations against corruption by noisy pseudo-outcomes, and a target network to stabilize training dynamics. For the final estimate, we discard the SDR correction and instead use the uncorrected nuisance models to perform Longitudinal Targeted Minimum Loss-Based Estimation (LTMLE) on the original outcomes. This second-stage, targeted debiasing ensures robustness and optimal finite-sample properties. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our model, D3-Net, robustly reduces bias and variance across different horizons, counterfactuals, and time-varying confoundings, compared to existing state-of-the-art ICE-based estimators.",

We propose an alternative route based on two theoretically grounded and empirically testable signatures of deep Jacobians: depth-induced exponential scaling of ordered singular values and strong spectral separation. Adopting a fixed-gates view of piecewise-linear networks, where Jacobians reduce to products of masked linear maps within a single activation region, we prove the existence of Lyapunov exponents governing the top singular values at initialization, give closed-form expressions in a tractable masked model, and quantify finite-depth corrections. We further show that sufficiently strong separation forces singular-vector alignment in matrix products, yielding an approximately shared singular basis for intermediate Jacobians. Together, these results motivate an approximation regime in which singular-value dynamics become effectively decoupled, mirroring classical balanced deep-linear analyses without requiring balancing. Experiments in fixed-gates settings validate the predicted scaling, alignment, and resulting dynamics, supporting a mechanistic account of emergent low-rank Jacobian structure as a driver of implicit bias.",

This gap is primarily due to (i) the absence of high-quality, privacy-sensitive data that capture personalized user-LLM interactions at scale, and (ii) the lack of robust reward signals for individual preferences. To overcome existing data limitations, we introduce a high-fidelity synthetic data generation framework called PersonaGym. Unlike prior work that treats personalization as static persona-preference pairs, PersonaGym models a dynamic preference process via an agentic LLM system to simulate realistic preference behaviors and semantic-aware noise in order to generate personalized multi-turn interaction trajectories. Using PersonaGym, we release PersonaAtlas, a large-scale, high-quality, and diverse synthetic dataset of high-fidelity multi-turn personalized interaction trajectories that closely mirror real-world preference expression and noise patterns. We further propose Personalized Prompt Optimization (PPOpt), a scalable and model-agnostic framework that optimizes user prompts based on interaction histories without modifying the deployed LLM. PPOpt adopts a reason-then-optimize paradigm that infers an explicit user profile and conditions prompt rewriting on the user profile to avoid reward hacking. Our training procedure for PPOpt integrates a cold-start supervised prior with outcome-driven multi-objective reinforcement learning. We present extensive experiments to demonstrate consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines in terms of task performance, personalization quality, and robustness to noisy as well as to sparse preference signals.",

We study this soft contamination of training data by semantic duplicates. Among other experiments, we embed the Olmo3 training corpus and find that: 1) contamination remains widespread, e.g. we find semantic duplicates for 78% of CodeForces and exact duplicates for 50% of ZebraLogic problems; 2) including semantic duplicates of benchmark data in training does improve benchmark performance; and 3) when finetuning on duplicates of benchmark datapoints, performance also improves on truly-held-out datapoints from the same benchmark. We argue that recent benchmark gains are thus confounded: the prevalence of soft contamination means gains reflect both genuine capability improvements and the accumulation of test data and effective test data in growing training corpora.",

Low-rank factorization offers a promising route to reduce training and inference costs, but the community lacks a stable recipe for training models from scratch using exclusively low-rank weights while matching the performance of the dense model. We demonstrate that Large Language Models (LLMs) can be trained from scratch using exclusively low-rank factorized weights for all non-embedding matrices without auxiliary \"full-rank\" guidance required by prior methods. While native low-rank training often suffers from instability and loss spikes, we identify uncontrolled growth in the spectral norm (largest singular value) of the weight matrix update as the dominant factor. To address this, we introduce Spectron: Spectral renormalization with orthogonalization, which dynamically bounds the resultant weight updates based on the current spectral norms of the factors. Our method enables stable, end-to-end factorized training with negligible overhead. Finally, we establish compute-optimal scaling laws for natively low-rank transformers, demonstrating predictable power-law behavior and improved inference efficiency relative to dense models.",

On the other hand, computationally efficient algorithms for learning Gibbs distributions rely on access to full sample configurations generated from the model. For many systems of interest that arise in physical contexts, expecting a full sample to be observed is not practical, and hence it is important to look for computationally efficient methods that solve the learning problem with access to only a limited set of statistics. We examine the trade-offs between the power of computation and observation within this scenario, employing the Ising model as a paradigmatic example. We demonstrate that it is feasible to reconstruct the model parameters for a model with $\\ell_1$ width $\\gamma$ by observing statistics up to an order of $O(\\gamma)$. This approach allows us to infer the model's structure and also learn its couplings and magnetic fields. We also discuss a setting where prior information about structure of the model is available and show that the learning problem can be solved efficiently with even more limited observational power.",

We introduce a training-free guidance method for steering continuous diffusion language models to satisfy formal syntactic constraints expressed using regular expressions. Our approach constructs an analytic score estimating the probability that a latent state decodes to a valid string accepted by a given regular expression, and uses its gradient to guide sampling, without training auxiliary classifiers. The denoising process targets the base model conditioned on syntactic validity. We implement our method in Diffinity on top of the PLAID diffusion model and evaluate it on 180 regular-expression constraints over JSON and natural-language benchmarks. Diffinity achieves 68-96\\% constraint satisfaction while incurring only a small perplexity cost relative to unconstrained sampling, outperforming autoregressive constrained decoding in both constraint satisfaction and output quality.",

        "abstract": "Deep ensemble methods often improve predictive performance, yet they suffer from three practical limitations: redundancy among base models that inflates computational cost and degrades conditioning, unstable weighting under multicollinearity, and overfitting in meta-learning pipelines. We propose a regularized meta-learning framework that addresses these challenges through a four-stage pipeline combining redundancy-aware projection, statistical meta-feature augmentation, and cross-validated regularized meta-models (Ridge, Lasso, and ElasticNet). Our multi-metric de-duplication strategy removes near-collinear predictors using correlation and MSE thresholds ($\\tau_{\\text{corr}}=0.95$), reducing the effective condition number of the meta-design matrix while preserving predictive diversity. Engineered ensemble statistics and interaction terms recover higher-order structure unavailable to raw prediction columns. A final inverse-RMSE blending stage mitigates regularizer-selection variance. On the Playground Series S6E1 benchmark (100K samples, 72 base models), the proposed framework achieves an out-of-fold RMSE of 8.582, improving over simple averaging (8.894) and conventional Ridge stacking (8.627), while matching greedy hill climbing (8.603) with substantially lower runtime (4 times faster). Conditioning analysis shows a 53.7\\% reduction in effective matrix condition number after redundancy projection. Comprehensive ablations demonstrate consistent contributions from de-duplication, statistical meta-features, and meta-ensemble blending. These results position regularized meta-learning as a stable and deployment-efficient stacking strategy for high-dimensional ensemble systems.",

Our study adopts a structured data model with tokens that include both class-relevant and class-irrelevant patterns under token-level noise and examines two canonical regimes: majority-voting and locality-structured data sequences. We prove that the model achieves guaranteed generalization by establishing non-asymptotic sample complexity and convergence rate bounds, which improve as the effective signal increases and the noise decreases. Furthermore, we show that the gating vector aligns with class-relevant features while ignoring irrelevant ones, thereby formalizing a feature-selection role similar to attention but realized through selective recurrence. Numerical experiments on synthetic data justify our theoretical results. Overall, our results provide principled insight into when and why Mamba-style selective SSMs learn efficiently, offering a theoretical counterpoint to Transformer-centric explanations.",

While RL-tuned VLMs improve on visual reasoning benchmarks, they remain vulnerable to weak visual grounding, hallucinations, and over-reliance on textual cues. We show that simple, controlled textual perturbations--misleading captions or incorrect chain-of-thought (CoT) traces--cause substantial drops in robustness and confidence, and that these effects are more pronounced when CoT consistency is taken into account across open-source multimodal reasoning models. Entropy-based metrics further show that these perturbations reshape model uncertainty and probability mass on the correct option, exposing model-specific trends in miscalibration. To better understand these vulnerabilities, we further analyze RL fine-tuning dynamics and uncover an accuracy-faithfulness trade-off: fine-tuning raises benchmark accuracy, but can simultaneously erode the reliability of the accompanying CoT and its robustness to contextual shifts. Although adversarial augmentation improves robustness, it does not by itself prevent faithfulness drift. Incorporating a faithfulness-aware reward can restore alignment between answers and reasoning, but when paired with augmentation, training risks collapsing onto shortcut strategies and robustness remains elusive. Together, these findings highlight the limitations of accuracy-only evaluations and motivate training and assessment protocols that jointly emphasize correctness, robustness, and the faithfulness of visually grounded reasoning.",

We introduce a taxonomy of problem classes, ranging from no-interaction and monotone games to potential and dynamics-coupled games, and provide prototypical environments for each. Furthermore, we propose MF-Garnets, a method for generating random MFG instances to facilitate rigorous statistical testing. We benchmark a variety of learning algorithms across these environments, including a novel black-box approach (MF-PSO) for exploitability minimization.

SALE is injected into both the imagination module that forecasts plausible future roll-outs and the joint agent network whose individual action values are combined through a mixing network to estimate the joint action-value function. By coupling imagined trajectories with SALE-based action values, the agents acquire a richer understanding of how their choices influence collective outcomes, leading to improved long-term planning and optimization under limited real-environment interactions.

While longer reasoning traces can improve answer quality and unlock abilities such as self-correction, they also incur high inference costs and often introduce redundant steps, known as overthinking. Recent research seeks to develop efficient reasoning strategies that balance reasoning length and accuracy, either through length-aware reward design or prompt-based calibration. However, these heuristic-based approaches may suffer from severe accuracy drop and be very sensitive to hyperparameters. To address these problems, we introduce CRT (Constraint-Rectified Training), a principled post-training framework based on reference-guarded constrained optimization, yielding a more stable and interpretable formulation for efficient reasoning. CRT alternates between minimizing reasoning length and rectifying accuracy only when performance falls below the reference, enabling stable and effective pruning of redundant reasoning. We further extend CRT with a two-stage training scheme that first discovers the shortest reliable reasoning patterns and then refines accuracy under a learnt length budget, preventing the re-emergence of verbose CoT. Our comprehensive evaluation shows that this framework consistently reduces token usage while maintaining answer quality at a robust and reliable level. Further analysis reveals that CRT improves reasoning efficiency not only by shortening responses but also by reducing internal language redundancy, leading to a new evaluation metric. Moreover, CRT-based training naturally yields a sequence of intermediate checkpoints that span a spectrum of explanation lengths while preserving correctness, enabling fine-grained control over reasoning verbosity without retraining.",

In particular, exponential family distributions offer a unified and analytically tractable modeling paradigm that encompasses many commonly used distributions. In this paper, we investigate analytic results for two important members of the exponential family within the HDP framework: the Poisson distribution and the normal distribution. We derive explicit closed-form expressions for the corresponding Gamma-Poisson and Normal-Gamma-Normal conjugate pairs under the hierarchical Dirichlet process construction. Detailed derivations and proofs are provided to clarify the underlying mathematical structure and to demonstrate how conjugacy can be systematically exploited in hierarchical nonparametric models.

Depending on the input, they may over-rely on linguistic priors relative to visual evidence, or conversely over-attend to visually salient but facts in textual contexts. Prior work has applied a uniform steering intensity to adjust the modality preference of MLLMs. However, strong steering can impair standard inference and increase error rates, whereas weak steering is often ineffective. In addition, because steering sensitivity varies substantially across multimodal instances, a single global strength is difficult to calibrate. To address this limitation with minimal disruption to inference, we introduce an instance-aware diagnostic metric that quantifies each modality's information contribution and reveals sample-specific susceptibility to steering. Building on these insights, we propose a scaling strategy that reduces steering for sensitive samples and a learnable module that infers scaling patterns, enabling instance-aware control of modality preference. Experimental results show that our instance-aware steering outperforms conventional steering in modulating modality preference, achieving effective adjustment while keeping generation error rates low.",

Conventional FedAvg and many advanced methods can suffer from excessive drift and degraded convergence under these realistic constraints. This work introduces Fractional-Order Roughness-Informed Federated Averaging (FO-RI-FedAvg), a lightweight and modular extension of FedAvg that improves stability through two complementary client-side mechanisms: (i) adaptive roughness-informed proximal regularization, which dynamically tunes the pull toward the global model based on local loss-landscape roughness, and (ii) non-integer-order local optimization, which incorporates short-term memory to smooth conflicting update directions. The approach preserves standard FedAvg server aggregation, adds only element-wise operations with amortizable overhead, and allows independent toggling of each component. Experiments on two real-world BEV energy prediction datasets, VED and its extended version eVED, show that FO-RI-FedAvg achieves improved accuracy and more stable convergence compared to strong federated baselines, particularly under reduced client participation.",

        "abstract": "Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures are often considered a natural fit for continual learning because sparse routing should localize updates and reduce interference, yet MoE Transformers still forget substantially even with sparse, well-balanced expert utilization. We attribute this gap to a pre-routing bottleneck: multi-head attention concatenates head-specific signals into a single post-attention router input, forcing routing to act on co-occurring feature compositions rather than separable head channels. We show that this router input simultaneously encodes multiple separately decodable semantic and structural factors with uneven head support, and that different feature compositions induce weakly aligned parameter-gradient directions; as a result, routing maps many distinct compositions to the same route. We quantify this collision effect via a route-wise effective composition number $N_{eff}$ and find that higher $N_{eff}$ is associated with larger old-task loss increases after continual training. Motivated by these findings, we propose MH-MoE, which performs head-wise routing over sub-representations to increase routing granularity and reduce composition collisions. On TRACE with Qwen3-0.6B/8B, MH-MoE effectively mitigates forgetting, reducing BWT on Qwen3-0.6B from 11.2% (LoRAMoE) to 4.5%.",

However, detecting single-lane abnormalities, that lead to congestions, is still a challenge. These single-lane abnormalities can be detected by monitoring lane change behaviour of vehicles, performed to avoid congestion along the monitoring section of a road. This paper presents a method to detect single-lane abnormalities by tracking individual vehicle paths and detecting vehicle lane changes along a section of a road. We propose a method to estimate the vehicle position at all time instances and fit a path using clustering techniques. We detect vehicle lane change by monitoring any change in spectral centroid of vehicle vibrations by tracking a reference vehicle along a highway. The evaluation of our proposed method with real traffic data showed 80% accuracy for lane change detection events that represent presence of abnormalities.",

We advocate a simpler and more unified perspective: an autoregressive attention head can be viewed as a dynamic two-layer MLP whose weights are instantiated from the context history. From this view, attention scores form an ever-growing hidden representation, and standard MLP activations such as ReLU or GLU naturally implement input-conditioned selection over a context-dependent memory pool rather than a probability distribution. Based on this formulation, we introduce HyperMLP and HyperGLU, which learn dynamic mixing in both feature space and sequence space, using a reverse-offset (lag) layout to align temporal mixing with autoregressive semantics. We provide theoretical characterizations of the expressivity and implications of this structure, and empirically show that HyperMLP/HyperGLU consistently outperform strong softmax-attention baselines under matched parameter budgets.",

While PAC-Bayes bounds (probably approximately correct) typically give bounds for the generalization error that hold with high probability, MAC-Bayes bounds have a similar form but bound the expected generalization error instead. The family of bounds we propose can be understood as a generalization of an expectation version of known PAC-Bayes bounds. Compared to standard PAC-Bayes bounds, the new bounds contain divergence terms that only depend on subsets (or \\emph{blocks}) of the training data. The proposed MAC-Bayes bounds hold the promise of significantly improving upon the tightness of traditional PAC-Bayes and MAC-Bayes bounds. This is illustrated with a simple numerical example in which the original PAC-Bayes bound is vacuous regardless of the choice of prior, while the proposed family of bounds are finite for appropriate choices of the block size. We also explore the question whether high-probability versions of our MAC-Bayes bounds (i.e., PAC-Bayes bounds of a similar form) are possible. We answer this question in the negative with an example that shows that in general, it is not possible to establish a PAC-Bayes bound which (a) vanishes with a rate faster than $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\log n)$ whenever the proposed MAC-Bayes bound vanishes with rate $\\mathcal{O}(n^{-1/2})$ and (b) exhibits a logarithmic dependence on the permitted error probability.",

As this paradigm evolves toward larger models and relational foundation models, scalable and realistic benchmarks are essential for enabling systematic evaluation and progress.

RelBench v2 adds four large-scale relational datasets spanning scholarly publications, enterprise resource planning, consumer platforms, and clinical records, increasing the benchmark to 11 datasets comprising over 22 million rows across 29 tables. We further introduce autocomplete tasks, a new class of predictive objectives that require models to infer missing attribute values directly within relational tables while respecting temporal constraints, expanding beyond traditional forecasting tasks constructed via SQL queries. In addition, RelBench v2 expands beyond its native datasets by integrating external benchmarks and evaluation frameworks: we translate event streams from the Temporal Graph Benchmark into relational schemas for unified relational-temporal evaluation, interface with ReDeLEx to provide uniform access to 70+ real-world databases suitable for pretraining, and incorporate 4DBInfer datasets and tasks to broaden multi-table prediction coverage. Experimental results demonstrate that RDL models consistently outperform single-table baselines across autocomplete, forecasting, and recommendation tasks, highlighting the importance of modeling relational structure explicitly.",

Although federated learning (FL) has gained prominence as a privacy-preserving framework for distributed IoT environments, current federated principal component analysis (PCA) methods lack the integration of personalization and robustness, which are critical for effective anomaly detection. To address these limitations, we propose an efficient personalized federated PCA (FedEP) method for anomaly detection in IoT networks. The proposed model achieves personalization through introducing local representations with the $\\ell_1$-norm for element-wise sparsity, while maintaining robustness via enforcing local models with the $\\ell_{2,1}$-norm for row-wise sparsity. To solve this non-convex problem, we develop a manifold optimization algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) with rigorous theoretical convergence guarantees. Experimental results confirm that the proposed FedEP outperforms the state-of-the-art FedPG, achieving excellent F1-scores and accuracy in various IoT security scenarios.

Trajectory success rewards are suitable for human judges or model fitting, but the sparsity severely limits RL sample efficiency. While recent methods have effectively improved RL via dense rewards, they rely heavily on high-quality human-annotated data or abundant expert supervision. To tackle these issues, this paper proposes Dual-granularity contrastive reward via generated Episodic Guidance (DEG), a novel framework to seek sample-efficient dense rewards without requiring human annotations or extensive supervision. Leveraging the prior knowledge of large video generation models, DEG only needs a small number of expert videos for domain adaptation to generate dedicated task guidance for each RL episode. Then, the proposed dual-granularity reward that balances coarse-grained exploration and fine-grained matching, will guide the agent to efficiently approximate the generated guidance video sequentially in the contrastive self-supervised latent space, and finally complete the target task. Extensive experiments on 18 diverse tasks across both simulation and real-world settings show that DEG can not only serve as an efficient exploration stimulus to help the agent quickly discover sparse success rewards, but also guide effective RL and stable policy convergence independently.",

We prove that LWCP preserves finite-sample marginal validity for any weight function; achieves asymptotically optimal conditional coverage at essentially no width cost when heteroscedasticity factors through leverage; and recovers the form and width of classical prediction intervals under Gaussian assumptions while retaining distribution-free guarantees. We further establish that randomized leverage approximations preserve coverage exactly with controlled width perturbation, and that vanilla CP suffers a persistent, sample-size-independent conditional coverage gap that LWCP eliminates. The method requires no hyperparameters beyond the choice of weight function and adds negligible computational overhead to vanilla CP. Experiments on synthetic and real data confirm the theoretical predictions, demonstrating substantial reductions in conditional coverage disparity across settings.",

To accurately and efficiently approximate original combinatorial calculations, SWING applies customized Gumbel-softmax sampling mechanism with linearized kernels, obtained via random features coupled with importance sampling techniques. This algorithm is of its own interest. SWING relies on the deep connection between implicitly defined graphs and Fourier analysis, presented in this paper.

However, purely data-driven models often require extensive training data and can generalize poorly, especially in small-data regimes and under unseen (out-of-distribution) input functions that are not represented in the training data. To address these limitations, we propose the Physics-Informed Laplace Neural Operator (PILNO), which enhances the Laplace Neural Operator (LNO) by embedding governing physics into training through PDE, boundary condition, and initial condition residuals. To improve expressivity, we first introduce an Advanced LNO (ALNO) backbone that retains a pole-residue transient representation while replacing the steady-state branch with an FNO-style Fourier multiplier. To make physics-informed training both data-efficient and robust, PILNO further leverages (i) virtual inputs: an unlabeled ensemble of input functions spanning a broad spectral range that provides abundant physics-only supervision and explicitly targets out-of-distribution (OOD) regimes; and (ii) temporal-causality weighting: a time-decaying reweighting of the physics residual that prioritizes early-time dynamics and stabilizes optimization for time-dependent PDEs. Across four representative benchmarks -- Burgers' equation, Darcy flow, a reaction-diffusion system, and a forced KdV equation -- PILNO consistently improves accuracy in small-data settings (e.g., N_train <= 27), reduces run-to-run variability across random seeds, and achieves stronger OOD generalization than purely data-driven baselines.",

However, most existing VFL frameworks rely on the idealized assumption of full sample alignment across participants, a premise that rarely holds in real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap, this work introduces Split-MoPE, a novel framework that integrates Split Learning with a specialized Mixture of Predefined Experts (MoPE) architecture. Unlike standard Mixture of Experts (MoE), where routing is learned dynamically, MoPE uses predefined experts to process specific data alignments, effectively maximizing data usage during both training and inference without requiring full sample overlap. By leveraging pretrained encoders for target data domains, Split-MoPE achieves state-of-the-art performance in a single communication round, significantly reducing the communication footprint compared to multi-round end-to-end training. Furthermore, unlike existing proposals that address sample misalignment, this novel architecture provides inherent robustness against malicious or noisy participants and offers per-sample interpretability by quantifying each collaborator's contribution to each prediction. Extensive evaluations on vision (CIFAR-10/100) and tabular (Breast Cancer Wisconsin) datasets demonstrate that Split-MoPE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art systems such as LASER and Vertical SplitNN, particularly in challenging scenarios with high data missingness.",

In contrast, self-supervised speech encoders such as WavLM provide strong acoustic representations yet remain opaque discriminative models with limited interpretability. To bridge this gap, we introduce ADEPT (Agentic Decoding of Emotion via Evidence Probing Tools), a framework that reframes emotion recognition as a multi-turn inquiry process rather than a single-pass prediction. ADEPT transforms an SLLM into an agent that maintains an evolving candidate emotion set and adaptively invokes dedicated semantic and acoustic probing tools within a structured pipeline of candidate generation, evidence collection, and adjudication. Crucially, ADEPT enables a paradigm shift from consensus learning to ambiguity-driven emotion reasoning. Since human affect exhibits inherent complexity and frequent co-occurrence of emotions, we treat minority annotations as informative perceptual signals rather than discarding them as noise. Finally, we integrate Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with an Evidence Trust Gate to explicitly couple tool-usage behaviors with prediction quality and enforce evidence-grounded reasoning. Experiments show that ADEPT improves primary emotion accuracy in most settings while substantially improving minor emotion characterization, producing explanations grounded in auditable acoustic and semantic evidence.",

While structured pruning can address these issues by removing redundant filters, existing methods typically rely on manually tuned hyperparameters such as pruning ratios which limit scalability and generalization across datasets. In this work, we propose Dynamic Structured Pruning (DSP), a fully automatic, structured pruning framework for convolution-based TSC models. DSP introduces an instance-wise sparsity loss during training to induce channel-level sparsity, followed by a global activation analysis to identify and prune redundant filters without needing any predefined pruning ratio. This work tackles computational bottlenecks of deep TSC models for deployment on resource-constrained devices. We validate DSP on 128 UCR datasets using two different deep state-of-the-art architectures: LITETime and InceptionTime. Our approach achieves an average compression of 58% for LITETime and 75% for InceptionTime architectures while maintaining classification accuracy. Redundancy analyses confirm that DSP produces compact and informative representations, offering a practical path for scalable and efficient deep TSC deployment.",

        "abstract": "The successor representation (SR) provides a powerful framework for decoupling predictive dynamics from rewards, enabling rapid generalisation across reward configurations. However, the classical SR is limited by its inherent policy dependence: policies change due to ongoing learning, environmental non-stationarities, and changes in task demands, making established predictive representations obsolete. Furthermore, in topologically complex environments, SRs suffer from spectral diffusion, leading to dense and overlapping features that scale poorly. Here we propose the Hierarchical Successor Representation (HSR) for overcoming these limitations. By incorporating temporal abstractions into the construction of predictive representations, HSR learns stable state features which are robust to task-induced policy changes. Applying non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF) to the HSR yields a sparse, low-rank state representation that facilitates highly sample-efficient transfer to novel tasks in multi-compartmental environments. Further analysis reveals that HSR-NMF discovers interpretable topological structures, providing a policy-agnostic hierarchical map that effectively bridges model-free optimality and model-based flexibility. Beyond providing a useful basis for task-transfer, we show that HSR's temporally extended predictive structure can also be leveraged to drive efficient exploration, effectively scaling to large, procedurally generated environments.",

We identify a critical theoretical flaw in this paradigm: during inference, the model operates in an open-loop manner, consuming its own generated outputs recursively. This leads to inevitable error accumulation (exposure bias), where minor early deviations cascade into significant trajectory drift over long horizons. In this paper, we reformulate autoregressive forecasting through the lens of control theory, proposing \\textbf{F-LLM} (Feedback-driven LLM), a novel closed-loop framework. Unlike standard methods that passively propagate errors, F-LLM actively stabilizes the trajectory via a learnable residual estimator (Observer) and a feedback controller. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical guarantee that our closed-loop mechanism ensures uniformly bounded error, provided the base model satisfies a local Lipschitz constraint. Extensive experiments demonstrate that F-LLM significantly mitigates error propagation, achieving good performance on time series benchmarks.",

We propose GRAIL, a framework that models longitudinal EHRs using structured geometric representations and structure-aware retrieval. GRAIL constructs a unified clinical graph by combining deterministic coding-system hierarchies with data-driven temporal associations across event types, embeds this graph in hyperbolic space, and summarizes each visit as a probabilistic Central Event that denoises sparse observations. At inference time, GRAIL retrieves a structured set of clinically plausible future events aligned with hierarchical and temporal progression, and optionally refines their ranking using an LLM as a constrained inference-time reranker. Experiments on MIMIC-IV show that GRAIL consistently improves multi-type next-visit prediction and yields more hierarchy-consistent forecasts.",

We introduce TRACE (Temporal Reasoning via Agentic Context Evolution), a framework that enables temporal clinical reasoning with frozen LLMs by explicitly structuring and maintaining context rather than extending context windows or updating parameters. TRACE operates over a dual-memory architecture consisting of a static Global Protocol encoding institutional clinical rules and a dynamic Individual Protocol tracking patient-specific state.

Tracking how vortices move, weaken, and dissipate over time from LiDAR measurements is still difficult because scans are sparse, vortex signatures fade as the flow breaks down under atmospheric turbulence and instabilities, and point-wise annotation is prohibitively expensive. Existing approaches largely treat each scan as an independent, fully supervised segmentation problem, which overlooks temporal structure and does not scale to the vast unlabeled archives collected in practice. We present X-VORTEX, a spatio-temporal contrastive learning framework grounded in Augmentation Overlap Theory that learns physics-aware representations from unlabeled LiDAR point cloud sequences. X-VORTEX addresses two core challenges: sensor sparsity and time-varying vortex dynamics. It constructs paired inputs from the same underlying flight event by combining a weakly perturbed sequence with a strongly augmented counterpart produced via temporal subsampling and spatial masking, encouraging the model to align representations across missing frames and partial observations. Architecturally, a time-distributed geometric encoder extracts per-scan features and a sequential aggregator models the evolving vortex state across variable-length sequences. We evaluate on a real-world dataset of over one million LiDAR scans. X-VORTEX achieves superior vortex center localization while using only 1% of the labeled data required by supervised baselines, and the learned representations support accurate trajectory forecasting.",

Furthermore, we introduce an explanatory competition-based category-aware recovery mechanism that leverages the proposed Specific Category-Specific Mutual Information (SCSMI) and Distinct Category-Specific Mutual Information (DCSMI) to salvage causal features obscured by label correlations. The method also incorporates structural symmetry checks and cross-dimensional redundancy removal to ensure the robustness and compactness of the identified Markov Blankets.

        "abstract": "Satellite-derived data products and climate model simulations of geophysical variables like precipitation, often exhibit systematic biases compared to in-situ measurements. Bias correction and spatial downscaling are fundamental components to develop operational weather forecast systems, as they seek to improve the consistency between coarse-resolution climate model simulations or satellite-based estimates and ground-based observations. In recent years, deep learning-based models have been increasingly replaced traditional statistical methods to generate high-resolution, bias free projections of climate variables. For example, Max-Average U-Net (MAUNet) architecture has been demonstrated for its ability to downscale precipitation estimates. The versatility and adaptability of these neural models make them highly effective across a range of applications, though this often come at the cost of high computational and memory requirements. The aim of this research is to develop light-weight neural network architectures for both bias correction and downscaling of precipitation, for which the teacher-student based learning paradigm is explored. This research demonstrates the adaptability of MAUNet to the task of bias correction, and further introduces a compact, lightweight neural network architecture termed this http URL proposed MAUNet-Light model is developed by transferring knowledge from the trained MAUNet, and it is designed to perform both downscaling and bias correction with reduced computational requirements without any significant loss in accuracy compared to state-of-the-art.",

However, existing multi-dimensional data recovery methods leveraging FCTN decomposition still have room for further enhancement, particularly in computational efficiency and modeling capability. To address these issues, we first propose a FCTN-based generalized nonconvex regularization paradigm from the perspective of gradient mapping. Then, reliable and scalable multi-dimensional data recovery models are investigated, where the model formulation is shifted from unquantized observations to coarse-grained quantized observations. Based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) framework, we derive efficient optimization algorithms with convergence guarantees to solve the formulated models. To alleviate the computational bottleneck encountered when processing large-scale multi-dimensional data, fast and efficient randomized compression algorithms are devised in virtue of sketching techniques in numerical linear algebra. These dimensionality-reduction techniques serve as the computational acceleration core of our proposed algorithm framework. Theoretical results on approximation error upper bounds and convergence analysis for the proposed method are derived. Extensive numerical experiments illustrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed algorithm over other state-of-the-art methods in terms of quantitative metrics, visual quality, and running time.",

Recent federated variants of GC have targeted distributed infrastructure applications (e.g., smart grids) with distributed clients that generate high-dimensional data bound by data-sovereignty constraints. However, Federated GC algorithms only yield deterministic point estimates of causality and neglect uncertainty. This paper establishes the first methodology for rigorously quantifying uncertainty and its propagation within federated GC frameworks. We systematically classify sources of uncertainty, explicitly differentiating aleatoric (data noise) from epistemic (model variability) effects. We derive closed-form recursions that model the evolution of uncertainty through client-server interactions and identify four novel cross-covariance components that couple data uncertainties with model parameter uncertainties across the federated architecture. We also define rigorous convergence conditions for these uncertainty recursions and obtain explicit steady-state variances for both server and client model parameters. Our convergence analysis demonstrates that steady-state variances depend exclusively on client data statistics, thus eliminating dependence on initial epistemic priors and enhancing robustness. Empirical evaluations on synthetic benchmarks and real-world industrial datasets demonstrate that explicitly characterizing uncertainty significantly improves the reliability and interpretability of federated causal inference.",

This study evaluates whether functional MRI-derived regional homogeneity (ReHo) can be used to classify ACAM-J using machine-learning approaches. We collected group-level fMRI data from 20 advanced meditators to train the classifiers, and intensive single-case data from an advanced practitioner performing ACAM-J and control tasks to evaluate generalization. ReHo maps were computed, and features were extracted from predefined brain regions of interest. We trained multiple machine learning classifiers using stratified cross-validation to evaluate whether ReHo patterns distinguish ACAM-J from non-meditative states. Ensemble models achieved 66.82% (p < 0.05) accuracy in distinguishing ACAM-J from control conditions. Feature-importance analysis indicated that prefrontal and anterior cingulate areas contributed most to model decisions, aligning with established involvement of these regions in attentional regulation and metacognitive processes. Moreover, moderate agreement reflected in Cohen's kappa supports the feasibility of using machine learning to distinguish ACAM-J from non-meditative states. These findings advocate machine-learning's feasibility in classifying advanced meditation states, future research on neuromodulation and mechanistic models of advanced meditation.",

This paper illustrates how to obtain probabilistic day-ahead forecasts of wind power generation via gradient boosting trees using an ensemble of weather forecasts. To this end, we perform a comparative analysis across three state-of-the-art probabilistic prediction methods-conformalised quantile regression, natural gradient boosting and conditional diffusion models-all of which can be combined with tree-based machine learning. The methods are validated using four years of data for all wind farms present within the Belgian offshore zone. Additionally, the point forecasts are benchmarked against deterministic engineering methods, using either the power curve or an advanced approach incorporating a calibrated analytical wake model. The experimental results show that the machine learning methods improve the mean absolute error by up to 53% and 33% compared to the power curve and the calibrated wake model. Considering the three probabilistic prediction methods, the conditional diffusion model is found to yield the best overall probabilistic and point estimate of wind power generation. Moreover, the findings suggest that the use of an ensemble of weather forecasts can improve point forecast accuracy by up to 23%.",

While lightweight architectures like MobileNet improve efficiency, they still demand thousands of parameters, limiting deployment on textile-integrated platforms. We introduce a convexified attention mechanism for wearable applications that dynamically weights features while preserving convexity through nonexpansive simplex projection and convex loss functions. Unlike conventional attention mechanisms using non-convex softmax operations, our approach employs Euclidean projection onto the probability simplex combined with multi-class hinge loss, ensuring global convergence guarantees. Implemented on a textile-based capacitive sensor with four connection points, our approach achieves 100.00\\% accuracy on tap gestures and 100.00\\% on swipe gestures -- consistent across 10-fold cross-validation and held-out test evaluation -- while requiring only 120--360 parameters, a 97\\% reduction compared to conventional approaches. With sub-millisecond inference times (290--296$\\mu$s) and minimal storage requirements ($<$7KB), our method enables gesture interfaces directly within e-textiles without external processing. Our evaluation, conducted in controlled laboratory conditions with a single-user dataset, demonstrates feasibility for basic gesture interactions. Real-world deployment would require validation across multiple users, environmental conditions, and more complex gesture vocabularies. These results demonstrate how convex optimization can enable efficient on-device machine learning for textile interfaces.",

To tackle these challenges, we propose TCRL, a novel temporal-coupled adversarial training framework for robust constrained reinforcement learning (TCRL) in worst-case scenarios. First, TCRL introduces a worst-case-perceived cost constraint function that estimates safety costs under temporally coupled perturbations without the need to explicitly model adversarial attackers. Second, TCRL establishes a dual-constraint defense mechanism on the reward to counter temporally coupled adversaries while maintaining reward unpredictability. Experimental results demonstrate that TCRL consistently outperforms existing methods in terms of robustness against temporally coupled perturbation attacks across a variety of CRL tasks.",

These environments can include factors such as sensor drift, changing user behavior, device aging, and adversarial dynamics. Contrastive continual learning (CCL) combines contrastive representation learning with incremental adaptation, enabling robust feature reuse across tasks and domains. However, the geometric nature of contrastive objectives, when paired with replay-based rehearsal and stability-preserving regularization, introduces new security vulnerabilities. Notably, backdoor attacks can exploit embedding alignment and replay reinforcement, enabling the implantation of persistent malicious behaviors that endure through updates and deployment cycles. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of backdoor attacks on CCL within IoT systems. We formalize the objectives of embedding-level attacks, examine persistence mechanisms unique to IoT deployments, and develop a layered taxonomy tailored to IoT. Additionally, we compare vulnerabilities across various learning paradigms and evaluate defense strategies under IoT constraints, including limited memory, edge computing, and federated aggregation. Our findings indicate that while CCL is effective for enhancing adaptive IoT intelligence, it may also elevate long-lived representation-level threats if not adequately secured.",

We propose Memory-efficient Structured Backpropagation (MeSP), which bridges this gap by manually deriving backward passes that exploit LoRA's low-rank structure. Our key insight is that the intermediate projection $h = xA$ can be recomputed during backward at minimal cost since rank $r \\ll d_{in}$, eliminating the need to store it. MeSP achieves 49\\% average memory reduction compared to MeBP on Qwen2.5 models (0.5B--3B) while computing mathematically identical gradients. Our analysis also reveals that MeZO's gradient estimates show near-zero correlation with true gradients (cosine similarity $\\approx$0.001), explaining its slow convergence. MeSP reduces peak memory from 361MB to 136MB for Qwen2.5-0.5B, enabling fine-tuning scenarios previously infeasible on memory-constrained devices.",

        "abstract": "Memory-efficient backpropagation (MeBP) has enabled first-order fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) on mobile devices with less than 1GB memory. However, MeBP requires backward computation through all transformer layers at every step, where weight decompression alone accounts for 32--42% of backward time. We propose Layer-Cyclic Selective Backpropagation (LCSB), which computes gradients for only a subset of layers per step. Our key insight is that residual connections guarantee gradient flow through identity paths, while AdamW momentum provides implicit updates for non-selected layers. We interpret LCSB as Block Coordinate Descent on the LoRA parameter space, providing theoretical justification for convergence. LCSB achieves up to 1.40$\\times$ speedup with less than 2\\% quality degradation across five models and three tasks. Surprisingly, in 4-bit quantized settings, LCSB exhibits superior stability: a 3B model that completely diverges under full backpropagation converges smoothly with LCSB, suggesting an implicit regularization effect from selective gradient computation.",

        "abstract": "Graph pre-training has achieved remarkable success in recent years, delivering transferable representations for downstream adaptation. However, most existing methods are designed for either homogeneous or heterogeneous graphs, thereby hindering unified graph modeling across diverse graph types. This separation contradicts real-world applications, where mixed homogeneous and heterogeneous graphs are ubiquitous, and distribution shifts between upstream pre-training and downstream deployment are common. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate that a balanced mixture of homogeneous and heterogeneous graph pre-training benefits downstream tasks and propose a unified multi-domain \\textbf{G}raph \\textbf{P}re-training method across \\textbf{H}omogeneous and \\textbf{H}eterogeneous graphs ($\\mathbf{GPH^{2}}$). To address the lack of a unified encoder for homogeneous and heterogeneous graphs, we propose a Unified Multi-View Graph Construction that simultaneously encodes both without explicit graph-type-specific designs. To cope with the increased cross-domain distribution discrepancies arising from mixed graphs, we introduce domain-specific expert encoding. Each expert is independently pre-trained on a single graph to capture domain-specific knowledge, thereby shielding the pre-training encoder from the adverse effects of cross-domain discrepancies. For downstream tasks, we further design a Task-oriented Expert Fusion Strategy that adaptively integrates multiple experts based on their discriminative strengths. Extensive experiments on mixed graphs demonstrate that $\\text{GPH}^{2}$ enables stable transfer across graph types and domains, significantly outperforming existing graph pre-training methods.",

However, existing frameworks like R-Zero often exhibit non-sustained improvement, where early gains degrade as self-play continues. We identify a key failure mode, Diversity Illusion, where the Solver's training signals appear diverse yet collapse into recurring underlying patterns. It manifests as (1) Local Diversity Illusion, where diversity is enforced only within-batch, inducing cross-iteration mode cycling; and (2) Surface Diversity Illusion, where questions vary superficially but require near-identical reasoning skills. To mitigate them, we propose R-Diverse with two aligned innovations: Memory-Augmented Penalty (MAP), which uses a persistent memory bank to discourage recycling across iterations, and Skill-Aware Measurement (SAM), which evaluates diversity by the reasoning skills exercised rather than surface variation of questions. Across 10 math and general reasoning benchmarks, R-Diverse sustains gains over more iterations and consistently outperforms prior self-play methods. Code is available at this https URL.",

However, their discrete, highly non-linear behavior makes them difficult to explain, validate and formally verify. As a result, BNNs remain largely opaque, limiting their suitability in safety-critical domains, where causal transparency and behavioral guarantees are essential. In this work, we introduce a Petri net (PN)-based framework that captures the BNN's internal operations as event-driven processes. By \"eventizing\" their operations, we expose their causal relationships and dependencies for a fine-grained analysis of concurrency, ordering, and state evolution. Here, we construct modular PN blueprints for core BNN components including activation, gradient computation and weight updates, and compose them into a complete system-level model. We then validate the composed PN against a reference software-based BNN, verify it against reachability and structural checks to establish 1-safeness, deadlock-freeness, mutual exclusion and correct-by-construction causal sequencing, before we assess its scalability and complexity at segment, component, and system levels using the automated measurement tools in Workcraft. Overall, this framework enables causal introspection of transparent and event-driven BNNs that are amenable to formal reasoning and verification.",

We address this gap with a key insight: atom ordering in neural representations matters. Building on this insight, we propose a structure-aware template-free framework that encodes the two-stage nature of chemical reactions as a positional inductive bias. By placing reaction center atoms at the sequence head, our method transforms implicit chemical knowledge into explicit positional patterns that the model can readily capture. The proposed RetroDiT backbone, a graph transformer with rotary position embeddings, exploits this ordering to prioritize chemically critical regions. Combined with discrete flow matching, our approach decouples training from sampling and enables generation in 20--50 steps versus 500 for prior diffusion methods. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both USPTO-50k (61.2% top-1) and the large-scale USPTO-Full (51.3% top-1) with predicted reaction centers. With oracle centers, performance reaches 71.1% and 63.4% respectively, surpassing foundation models trained on 10 billion reactions while using orders of magnitude less data. Ablation studies further reveal that structural priors outperform brute-force scaling: a 280K-parameter model with proper ordering matches a 65M-parameter model without it.",

We show that a missing principle is making GNN-MD IO-aware, carefully accounting for reads and writes between GPU high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and on-chip SRAM. We present FlashSchNet, an efficient and accurate IO-aware SchNet-style GNN-MD framework built on four techniques: (1) flash radial basis, which fuses pairwise distance computation, Gaussian basis expansion, and cosine envelope into a single tiled pass, computing each distance once and reusing it across all basis functions; (2) flash message passing, which fuses cutoff, neighbor gather, filter multiplication, and reduction to avoid materializing edge tensors in HBM; (3) flash aggregation, which reformulates scatter-add via CSR segment reduce, reducing atomic writes by a factor of feature dimension and enabling contention-free accumulation in both forward and backward passes; (4) channel-wise 16-bit quantization that exploits the low per-channel dynamic range in SchNet MLP weights to further improve throughput with negligible accuracy loss. On a single NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000, FlashSchNet achieves 1000 ns/day aggregate simulation throughput over 64 parallel replicas on coarse-grained (CG) protein containing 269 beads (6.5x faster than CGSchNet baseline with 80% reduction of peak memory), surpassing classical force fields (e.g. MARTINI) while retaining SchNet-level accuracy and transferability.",

However, aggressive low-bit PTQ can mask or erase unlearning updates, causing quantized models to revert to pre-unlearning behavior. We show that standard full-parameter fine-tuning often induce parameter changes that are too small to survive 4-bit quantization. We propose quantization-robust unlearning via low-rank adaptation (LoRA): we freeze the base model and concentrate unlearning into trainable adapters so that the effective update is preserved after quantization. On Llama-2-7B evaluated with MUSE dataset (BOOKS and NEWS), LoRA improves 4-bit utility by up to 7.93 points (NPO+GDR on BOOKS: 50.17 to 58.10) and yields higher 4-bit utility on NEWS for GA+GDR (40.06 to 44.82, increase of 4.76). LoRA also substantially reduces privacy leakage under 4-bit PTQ, e.g., for GA+KLR on BOOKS, PrivLeak moves from -25.68 to -5.86 (closer to ideal 0), while maintaining strong forgetting (VerMem and KnowMem near 0). Thus, using LoRA for Machine Unlearning is beneficial for scenarios where quantization is necessary for model deployment.",

However, existing learning-based approaches for hard combinatorial optimization tasks often rely on supervised training data, reinforcement learning, or gradient estimators, leading to significant computational overhead, unstable training, or a lack of provable performance guarantees. In contrast, classical approximation algorithms offer such performance guarantees under worst-case inputs but are non-differentiable and unable to adaptively exploit structural regularities in natural input distributions. We address this dichotomy with the fundamental example of Uniform Facility Location (UniFL), a variant of the combinatorial facility location problem with applications in clustering, data summarization, logistics, and supply chain design. We develop a fully differentiable MPNN model that embeds approximation-algorithmic principles while avoiding the need for solver supervision or discrete relaxations. Our approach admits provable approximation and size generalization guarantees to much larger instances than seen during training. Empirically, we show that our approach outperforms standard non-learned approximation algorithms in terms of solution quality, closing the gap with computationally intensive integer linear programming approaches.

This work presents a comprehensive analysis of GF characteristics through fault-current analysis and a simulation-based case study covering multiple fault locations. Building on these insights, we propose an edge-AI-based GF localization approach tailored for three-phase TN-earthed PV systems. A PLECS-based simulation model that incorporates PV hysteresis effects is developed to generate diverse GF scenarios, from which correlation-based features are extracted throughout the inverter's four-stage shutdown sequence. Using the simulated dataset, a lightweight Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB)-based localization model is designed and trained, achieving over 93% localization accuracy at typical sampling rates with low computational cost, demonstrating strong potential for deployment on resource-constrained PV inverters.",

We analyzed Automatic Identification System (AIS) data from 2010-2019 to examine vessel speed over ground (SOG). Over half of the AIS records showed zero SOG, and treating zero and positive SOG as a single continuous process can obscure important patterns. We therefore applied a two-stage machine learning framework, first modeling the probability of SOG greater than zero and then modeling SOG conditional on being positive. AIS observations were integrated with sea ice concentration, course over ground, wind, bathymetric depth, distance to coast, vessel group, and navigational status. Gradient boosted decision trees with random effects captured nonlinear environmental responses while accounting for repeated observations. The positive SOG classifier achieved strong discrimination (AUC = 0.85), while the conditional speed model explained approximately 77 percent of out-of-fold variance. SHAP values quantified covariate effects by decomposing model predictions into additive contributions from individual variables. Distance to coast and bathymetric depth were dominant determinants of both the likelihood and magnitude of vessel speed, while changes in course, vessel group, and navigational status introduced secondary variation. Wind and sea ice effects were modest. Together, these results empirically characterize Arctic vessel operating regimes relevant to speed management and corridor-level assessment.",

We then investigate how reliably large language models (LLMs) can extract these music descriptors, finding that they do capture explicit descriptors but struggle with context-dependent ones. This work can further serve as a benchmark for fine-grained modeling of user intent and for gaining insights into improving LLM-based music understanding systems.",

        "abstract": "Medical image foundation models (MIFMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential for a wide range of clinical tasks, yet their development is constrained by the scarcity, heterogeneity, and high cost of large-scale annotated datasets. Here, we propose RaSD (Randomized Synthesis and Disentanglement), a scalable framework for pre-training MIFMs entirely on synthetic data. By modeling anatomical structures and appearance variations with randomized Gaussian distributions, RaSD exposes models to sufficient multi-scale structural and appearance perturbations, forcing them to rely on invariant and task-relevant anatomical cues rather than dataset-specific textures, thereby enabling robust and transferable representation learning. We pre-trained RaSD on 1.2 million 3D volumes and 9.6 million 2D images, and extensively evaluated the resulting models across 6 imaging modalities, 48 datasets, and 56 downstream tasks. Across all evaluated downstream tasks, RaSD consistently outperforms training-from-scratch models, achieves the best performance on 17 tasks, and remains comparable to models pre-trained on large real datasets in most others. These results demonstrate that the capacity of synthetic data alone to drive robust representation learning. Our findings establish a paradigm shift in medical AI, demonstrating that synthetic data can serve as a \"free lunch\" for scalable, privacy-preserving, and clinically generalizable foundation models.",

While stationary strategies are preferred for their practicality, computing stationary forms of classic game-theoretic equilibria is computationally intractable -- a stark contrast to the comparative ease of solving single-agent RL or zero-sum games. To bridge this gap, we study Risk-averse Quantal response Equilibria (RQE), a solution concept rooted in behavioral game theory that incorporates risk aversion and bounded rationality. We demonstrate that RQE possesses strong regularity conditions that make it uniquely amenable to learning in MGs. We propose a novel two-timescale Actor-Critic algorithm characterized by a fast-timescale actor and a slow-timescale critic.

Prior approaches either treat failure reasoning as a closed-set classification problem or assume access to ample human annotations. Failures in the real world are typically subtle, combinatorial, and difficult to enumerate, whereas rich reasoning labels are expensive to acquire. We address this problem by introducing ARMOR: Adaptive Round-based Multi-task mOdel for Robotic failure detection and reasoning. We formulate detection and reasoning as a multi-task self-refinement process, where the model iteratively predicts detection outcomes and natural language reasoning conditioned on past outputs. During training, ARMOR learns from heterogeneous supervision - large-scale sparse binary labels and small-scale rich reasoning annotations - optimized via a combination of offline and online imitation learning. At inference time, ARMOR generates multiple refinement trajectories and selects the most confident prediction via a self-certainty metric. Experiments across diverse environments show that ARMOR achieves state-of-the-art performance by improving over the previous approaches by up to 30% on failure detection rate and up to 100% in reasoning measured through LLM fuzzy match score, demonstrating robustness to heterogeneous supervision and open-ended reasoning beyond predefined failure modes.

Across four aligned instruction-tuned models and twelve jailbreak attacks, CC-Delta achieves comparable or better safety-utility tradeoffs than baseline defenses operating in dense latent space. In particular, our method clearly outperforms dense mean-shift steering on all four models, and particularly against out-of-distribution attacks, showing that steering in sparse SAE feature space offers advantages over steering in dense activation space for jailbreak mitigation.

It has recently been proposed as a powerful tool for executing consensus-based optimization algorithms in fully decentralized systems. A key advantage of NCOTA is that it enables unbiased consensus estimation without channel state information at either transmitters or receivers, requires no transmission scheduling, and scales efficiently to dense network deployments. However, NCOTA is inherently susceptible to external interference, which can bias the consensus estimate and deteriorate the convergence of the underlying decentralized optimization algorithm. In this paper, we propose a novel interference-robust (IR-)NCOTA scheme. The core idea is to apply a coordinated random rotation of the frame of reference across all nodes, and transmit a pseudo-random pilot signal, allowing to transform external interference into a circularly symmetric distribution with zero mean relative to the rotated frame. This ensures that the consensus estimates remain unbiased, preserving the convergence guarantees of the underlying optimization algorithm. Through numerical results on a classification task, it is demonstrated that IR-NCOTA exhibits superior performance over the baseline NCOTA algorithm in the presence of external interference.",

We show that response bias is prevalent in LMs pre-correction and that $\\texttt{RBCorr}$ effectively eliminates bias and boosts model performance. We also explore the generalizability of bias behavior across models, datasets, and prompt formats, showing that LogProbs-based correction is highly dependent on all three of these aspects. Overall, $\\texttt{RBCorr}$ is an easy-to-use method that can boost the performance of smaller LMs and ensure that LM performance on closed-response benchmarks aligns more closely with their true capabilities.",

Since automated algorithms for analyzing such signals increasingly inform clinically relevant decisions, identifying signal segments on which these algorithms may produce unreliable outputs is of critical importance. Signal quality indices (SQIs) are commonly used for this purpose. However, most existing SQIs are task agnostic and do not account for the specific algorithm and performance metric used downstream. In this work, we formalize signal quality as a task- and metric-dependent concept and propose a perturbation-based SQI (pSQI) that aims to detect an algorithm's performance degradation on an input signal with respect to a metric. The pSQI is defined as the worst-case value of the performance metric under an additive, colored Gaussian noise perturbation with a lower-bounded signal-to-noise ratio. We introduce formal requirements for task- and metric-specific SQIs, including monotonicity of the metric in expectation and maximal separation under thresholding. Experiments on R-peak detection and atrial fibrillation classification benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed pSQI consistently outperforms existing feature- and deep learning-based SQIs in identifying unreliable inputs without requiring training.",

While traditional GP-based approaches provide reliable Bayesian predictions with uncertainty quantification, they are computationally expensive and thus unsuitable for real-time simulations. To address this challenge, we integrate gradient information to improve accuracy and introduce a novel partitioning and approximation strategy to reduce online computational cost. In particular, for the latter, we associate a local GP with each non-overlapping region; by splitting the training data into local near and far subsets, and by using Schur complements, we show that a large part of the matrix inversions required for inference can be performed offline, enabling real-time inference at frequencies above 30 Hz on standard desktop hardware. To generate a training dataset that captures aerodynamic effects, such as rotor-rotor interactions and apparent wind direction, we use the CHARM code, which is a mid-fidelity aerodynamic solver. It is applied to the SUI Endurance quadrotor to predict force and torque, along with noise at three specified locations. The derivative information is obtained via finite differences. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed partitioned GP with gradient conditioning achieves higher accuracy than standard partitioned GPs without gradient information, while greatly reducing computational time. This framework provides an efficient foundation for real-time aerodynamic prediction and control algorithms in complex and unsteady environments.",

        "abstract": "As autonomous robots move into complex, dynamic real-world environments, they must learn to navigate safely in real time, yet anticipating all possible behaviors is infeasible. We propose a composable, model-free reinforcement learning method that learns a value function and an optimal policy for each individual environment element (e.g., goal or obstacle) and composes them online to achieve goal reaching and collision avoidance. Assuming unknown nonlinear dynamics that evolve in continuous time and are input-affine, we derive a continuous-time Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation for the value function and show that the corresponding advantage function is quadratic in the action and optimal policy. Based on this structure, we introduce a model-free actor-critic algorithm that learns policies and value functions for static or moving obstacles using gradient descent. We then compose multiple reach/avoid models via a quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP), yielding formal obstacle-avoidance guarantees in terms of value-function level sets, providing a model-free alternative to CLF/CBF-based controllers. Simulations demonstrate improved performance over a PPO baseline applied to a discrete-time approximation.",

        "abstract": "In truncated linear regression, samples $(x,y)$ are shown only when the outcome $y$ falls inside a certain survival set $S^\\star$ and the goal is to estimate the unknown $d$-dimensional regressor $w^\\star$. This problem has a long history of study in Statistics and Machine Learning going back to the works of (Galton, 1897; Tobin, 1958) and more recently in, e.g., (Daskalakis et al., 2019; 2021; Lee et al., 2023; 2024). Despite this long history, however, most prior works are limited to the special case where $S^\\star$ is precisely known. The more practically relevant case, where $S^\\star$ is unknown and must be learned from data, remains open: indeed, here the only available algorithms require strong assumptions on the distribution of the feature vectors (e.g., Gaussianity) and, even then, have a $d^{\\mathrm{poly} (1/\\varepsilon)}$ run time for achieving $\\varepsilon$ accuracy. In this work, we give the first algorithm for truncated linear regression with unknown survival set that runs in $\\mathrm{poly} (d/\\varepsilon)$ time, by only requiring that the feature vectors are sub-Gaussian. Our algorithm relies on a novel subroutine for efficiently learning unions of a bounded number of intervals using access to positive examples (without any negative examples) under a certain smoothness condition. This learning guarantee adds to the line of works on positive-only PAC learning and may be of independent interest.",

Although rigorous, these approaches require large samples and may be constrained by data availability and cross-cultural comparability. Recent advances in natural language processing suggest that the semantic structure of questionnaire items may encode latent construct organization, offering a complementary response-free perspective. We introduce a topic-modeling framework that operationalizes semantic latent structure for scale simplification. Items are encoded using contextual sentence embeddings and grouped via density-based clustering to discover latent semantic factors without predefining their number. Class-based term weighting derives interpretable topic representations that approximate constructs and enable merging of semantically adjacent clusters. Representative items are selected using membership criteria within an integrated reduction pipeline. We benchmarked the framework across DASS, IPIP, and EPOCH, evaluating structural recovery, internal consistency, factor congruence, correlation preservation, and reduction efficiency. The proposed method recovered coherent factor-like groupings aligned with established constructs. Selected items reduced scale length by 60.5% on average while maintaining psychometric adequacy. Simplified scales showed high concordance with original factor structures and preserved inter-factor correlations, indicating that semantic latent organization provides a response-free approximation of measurement structure. Our framework formalizes semantic structure as an inspectable front-end for scale construction and reduction. To facilitate adoption, we provide a visualization-supported tool enabling one-click semantic analysis and structured simplification.",

In particular, minimum-norm interpolating estimators can perform well, suggesting the need for new tradeoff in these settings. Accordingly, we propose a regularization-sharpness tradeoff for overparameterized linear regression with an $\\ell^p$ penalty. Inspired by the interpolating information criterion, our framework decomposes the selection penalty into a regularization term (quantifying the alignment of the regularizer and the interpolator) and a geometric sharpness term on the interpolating manifold (quantifying the effect of local perturbations), yielding a tradeoff analogous to bias-variance. Building on prior analyses that established this information criterion for ridge regularizers, this work first provides a general expression of the interpolating information criterion for $\\ell^p$ regularizers where $p \\ge 2$. Subsequently, we extend this to the LASSO interpolator with $\\ell^1$ regularizer, which induces stronger sparsity. Empirical results on real-world datasets with random Fourier features and polynomials validate our theory, demonstrating how the tradeoff terms can distinguish performant linear interpolators from weaker ones.",

Traditional approaches, such as static and dynamic analysis, extract valuable insights from stripped binaries, but often demand substantial expertise and manual effort. Recent advances in deep learning have opened promising opportunities to enhance binary analysis by capturing latent features and disclosing underlying code semantics. Despite the growing number of binary analysis models based on machine learning, their robustness to adversarial code transformations at the binary level remains underexplored. We evaluate the robustness of deep learning models for the task of binary code similarity detection (BCSD) under semantics-preserving transformations. The unique nature of machine instructions presents distinct challenges compared to the typical input perturbations found in other domains. We introduce asmFooler, a system that evaluates the resilience of BCSD models using a diverse set of adversarial code transformations that preserve functional semantics. We construct a dataset of 9,565 binary variants from 620 baseline samples by applying eight semantics-preserving transformations across six representative BCSD models. Our major findings highlight several key insights: i) model robustness relies on the processing pipeline, including code pre-processing, architecture, and feature selection; ii) adversarial transformation effectiveness is bounded by a budget shaped by model-specific constraints like input size and instruction expressive capacity; iii) well-crafted transformations can be highly effective with minimal perturbations; and iv) such transformations efficiently disrupt model decisions (e.g., misleading to false positives or false negatives) by focusing on semantically significant instructions.",

The key to our method lies in a carefully designed training recipe and deployment strategy. Xiaomi-Robotics-0 is first pre-trained on large-scale cross-embodiment robot trajectories and vision-language data, endowing it with broad and generalizable action-generation capabilities while avoiding catastrophic forgetting of the visual-semantic knowledge of the underlying pre-trained VLM. During post-training, we propose several techniques for training the VLA model for asynchronous execution to address the inference latency during real-robot rollouts. During deployment, we carefully align the timesteps of consecutive predicted action chunks to ensure continuous and seamless real-time rollouts. We evaluate Xiaomi-Robotics-0 extensively in simulation benchmarks and on two challenging real-robot tasks that require precise and dexterous bimanual manipulation. Results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across all simulation benchmarks. Moreover, Xiaomi-Robotics-0 can roll out fast and smoothly on real robots using a consumer-grade GPU, achieving high success rates and throughput on both real-robot tasks.

Our approach couples a classical morphological detector with a learning-based refinement module: a SegFormer backbone adapted via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Uniquely, we employ a detector-guided strategy, injecting the morphological map as an input spatial prior, while a masked hybrid loss and logit adjustment constrain the training to focus specifically on refining candidate crack regions. The refined masks subsequently guide an Anisotropic Diffusion inpainting stage to reconstruct missing content. Experimental results demonstrate that our pipeline significantly outperforms state-of-the-art photographic restoration models in zero-shot settings, while faithfully preserving the original paint brushwork.",

Conformal Prediction (CP) could be directly wrapped around existing methods to obtain prediction sets with guaranteed coverage. However, a direct application of CP would treat OS identification as a flat classification problem, ignoring the natural taxonomic structure of OSs and providing brittle point predictions. This work addresses these limitations by introducing and evaluating two distinct structured CP strategies: level-wise CP (L-CP), which calibrates each hierarchy level independently, and projection-based CP (P-CP), which ensures structural consistency by projecting leaf-level sets upwards. Our results demonstrate that, while both methods satisfy validity guarantees, they expose a fundamental trade-off between level-wise efficiency and structural consistency. L-CP yields tighter prediction sets suitable for human forensic analysis but suffers from taxonomic inconsistencies. Conversely, P-CP guarantees hierarchically consistent, nested sets ideal for automated policy enforcement, albeit at the cost of reduced efficiency at coarser levels.",

In this work, we revisit the fundamental limits of single-TOSC through the lens of indirect rate-distortion theory. We highlight the conditions under which existing rate-distortion bounds are achievable and show their limitations in realistic settings. We then introduce task model-aware rate-distortion bounds that account for task model suboptimality and architectural constraints.

        "abstract": "We study repeated bilateral trade when the valuations of the sellers and the buyers are contextual. More precisely, the agents' valuations are given by the inner product of a context vector with two unknown $d$-dimensional vectors -- one for the buyers and one for the sellers. At each time step $t$, the learner receives a context and posts two prices, one for the seller and one for the buyer, and the trade happens if both agents accept their price. We study two objectives for this problem, gain from trade and profit, proving no-regret with respect to a surprisingly strong benchmark: the best omniscient dynamic strategy. In the natural scenario where the learner observes \\emph{separately} whether the agents accept their price -- the so-called \\emph{two-bit} feedback -- we design algorithms that achieve $O(d\\log d)$ regret for gain from trade, and $O(d \\log\\log T + d\\log d)$ regret for profit maximization. Both results are tight, up to the $\\log(d)$ factor, and implement per-step budget balance, meaning that the learner never incurs negative profit. In the less informative \\emph{one-bit} feedback model, the learner only observes whether a trade happens or not. For this scenario, we show that the tight two-bit regret regimes are still attainable, at the cost of allowing the learner to possibly incur a small negative profit of order $O(d\\log d)$, which is notably independent of the time horizon. As a final set of results, we investigate the combination of one-bit feedback and per-step budget balance. There, we design an algorithm for gain from trade that suffers regret independent of the time horizon, but \\emph{exponential} in the dimension $d$. For profit maximization, we maintain this exponential dependence on the dimension, which gets multiplied by a $\\log T$ factor.",

At each round, the learner faces a seller-buyer pair and must propose a trade price without observing their private valuations for the item being sold. The goal of the learner is to post prices to facilitate trades between the two parties. Before posting a price, the learner observes a $d$-dimensional context vector that influences the agent's valuations. Prior work in the contextual setting has focused on linear models. In this work, we tackle a general nonparametric setting in which the buyer's and seller's valuations behave according to arbitrary Lipschitz functions of the context. We design an algorithm that leverages contextual information through a hierarchical tree construction and guarantees regret $\\widetilde{O}(T^{{(d-1)}/d})$. Remarkably, our algorithm operates under two stringent features of the setting: (1) one-bit feedback, where the learner only observes whether a trade occurred or not, and (2) strong budget balance, where the learner cannot subsidize or profit from the market participants. We further provide a matching lower bound in the full-feedback setting, demonstrating the tightness of our regret bound.",

Leveraging a low dimensional summary statistics description, we precisely characterize the interplay between the initial temperature and the annealing rate, and derive a sharp formula for the probability of mode collapse. Our analysis shows that an appropriately chosen annealing scheme can robustly prevent mode collapse. Finally, we present numerical evidence that these theoretical tradeoffs qualitatively extend to neural network based models, RealNVP normalizing flows, providing guidance for designing annealing strategies mitigating mode collapse in practical variational inference pipelines.",

By analyzing models trained on single-label ADI data, we show that the main difficulty in repurposing such datasets for Multi-Label Arabic Dialect Identification (MLADI) lies in the selection of negative samples, as many sentences treated as negative could be acceptable in multiple dialects. To address these issues, we construct a multi-label dataset by generating automatic multi-label annotations using GPT-4o and binary dialect acceptability classifiers, with aggregation guided by the Arabic Level of Dialectness (ALDi). Afterward, we train a BERT-based multi-label classifier using curriculum learning strategies aligned with dialectal complexity and label cardinality. On the MLADI leaderboard, our best-performing LAHJATBERT model achieves a macro F1 of 0.69, compared to 0.55 for the strongest previously reported system.

Observed clicks reflect a mixture of users' intrinsic preferences and the uplift induced by these interventions. This causes conventional models to miscalibrate base CTRs, which distorts downstream ranking and billing decisions. Furthermore, marketing interventions often operate as multi-valued treatments with varying magnitudes, introducing additional complexity to CTR prediction. To address these issues, we propose the \\textbf{Uni}fied \\textbf{M}ulti-\\textbf{V}alued \\textbf{T}reatment Network (UniMVT). Specifically, UniMVT disentangles confounding factors from treatment-sensitive representations, enabling a full-space counterfactual inference module to jointly reconstruct the debiased base CTR and intensity-response curves. To handle the complexity of multi-valued treatments, UniMVT employs an auxiliary intensity estimation task to capture treatment propensities and devise a unit uplift objective that normalizes the intervention effect. This ensures comparable estimation across the continuous coupon-value spectrum. UniMVT simultaneously achieves debiased CTR prediction for accurate system calibration and precise uplift estimation for incentive allocation. Extensive experiments on synthetic and industrial datasets demonstrate UniMVT's superiority in both predictive accuracy and calibration. Furthermore, real-world A/B tests confirm that UniMVT significantly improves business metrics through more effective coupon distribution.",

        "abstract": "Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has been proposed as an effective and efficient alternative to reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). However, neither RLHF nor DPO take into account the fact that learning certain preferences is more difficult than learning other preferences, rendering the optimization process suboptimal. To address this gap in text-to-image generation, we recently proposed Curriculum-DPO, a method that organizes image pairs by difficulty. In this paper, we introduce Curriculum-DPO++, an enhanced method that combines the original data-level curriculum with a novel model-level curriculum. More precisely, we propose to dynamically increase the learning capacity of the denoising network as training advances. We implement this capacity increase via two mechanisms. First, we initialize the model with only a subset of the trainable layers used in the original Curriculum-DPO. As training progresses, we sequentially unfreeze layers until the configuration matches the full baseline architecture. Second, as the fine-tuning is based on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we implement a progressive schedule for the dimension of the low-rank matrices. Instead of maintaining a fixed capacity, we initialize the low-rank matrices with a dimension significantly smaller than that of the baseline. As training proceeds, we incrementally increase their rank, allowing the capacity to grow until it converges to the same rank value as in Curriculum-DPO. Furthermore, we propose an alternative ranking strategy to the one employed by Curriculum-DPO. Finally, we compare Curriculum-DPO++ against Curriculum-DPO and other state-of-the-art preference optimization approaches on nine benchmarks, outperforming the competing methods in terms of text alignment, aesthetics and human preference.

We reinterpret the nonlinear component through the lens of Barron function approximation, viewing two-layer networks, random Fourier features, and extreme learning machines as discretizations of integral representations over parameter measures. This perspective naturally admits Bayesian inference on the nonlinear map and yields posterior predictive uncertainty. By combining Laguerre-parameterized causal dynamics with probabilistic Barron-type nonlinear approximators, we obtain a structured yet expressive class of causal operators equipped with uncertainty quantification. The resulting framework bridges classical system identification and modern measure-based function approximation, providing a principled approach to time-series modeling and nonlinear systems identification.",

This perspective yields an exact variance identity for the forest predictor that separates finite-aggregation variability from a structural dependence term that persists even under infinite aggregation. We further decompose both single-tree dispersion and inter-tree covariance using the laws of total variance and covariance, isolating two fundamental design mechanisms-reuse of training observations and alignment of data-adaptive partitions. These mechanisms induce a strict covariance floor, demonstrating that predictive variability cannot be eliminated by increasing the number of trees alone. The resulting framework clarifies how resampling, feature-level randomization, and split selection govern resolution, tree variability, and dependence, and establishes random forests as explicit finite-sample statistical designs whose behavior is determined by their underlying randomized construction.",

        "abstract": "OMD and its variants give a flexible framework for OCO where the performance depends crucially on the choice of the mirror map. While the geometries underlying OPGD and OEG, both special cases of OMD, are well understood, it remains a challenging open question on how to construct an optimal mirror map for any given constrained set and a general family of loss functions, e.g., sparse losses. Motivated by parameterizing a near-optimal set of mirror maps, we consider a simpler question: is it even possible to obtain polynomial gains in regret by using mirror maps for geometries that interpolate between $L_1$ and $L_2$, which may not be possible by restricting to only OEG ($L_1$) or OPGD ($L_2$). Our main result answers this question positively. We show that mirror maps based on block norms adapt better to the sparsity of loss functions, compared to previous $L_p$ (for $p \\in [1, 2]$) interpolations. In particular, we construct a family of online convex optimization instances in $\\mathbb{R}^d$, where block norm-based mirror maps achieve a provable polynomial (in $d$) improvement in regret over OEG and OPGD for sparse loss functions. We then turn to the setting in which the sparsity level of the loss functions is unknown. In this case, the choice of geometry itself becomes an online decision problem. We first show that naively switching between OEG and OPGD can incur linear regret, highlighting the intrinsic difficulty of geometry selection. To overcome this issue, we propose a meta-algorithm based on multiplicative weights that dynamically selects among a family of uniform block norms. We show that this approach effectively tunes OMD to the sparsity of the losses, yielding adaptive regret guarantees. Overall, our results demonstrate that online mirror-map selection can significantly enhance the ability of OMD to exploit sparsity in online convex optimization.",

        "abstract": "Effective water resource management depends on accurate projections of flows in water channels. For projected climate data, use of different General Circulation Models (GCM) simulates contrasting results. This study shows selection of GCM for the latest generation CMIP6 for hydroclimate change impact studies. Envelope based method was used for the selection, which includes components based on machine learning techniques, allowing the selection of GCMs without the need for in-situ reference data. According to our knowledge, for the first time, such a comparison was performed for the CMIP6 Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) scenarios data. In addition, the effect of climate change under SSP scenarios was studied, along with the calculation of extreme indices. Finally, GCMs were compared to quantify spatiotemporal differences between CMIP5 and CMIP6 data. Results provide NorESM2 LM, FGOALS g3 as selected models for the Jhelum and Chenab River. Highly vulnerable regions under the effect of climate change were highlighted through spatial maps, which included parts of Punjab, Jammu, and Kashmir. Upon comparison of CMIP5 and CMIP6, no discernible difference was found between the RCP and SSP scenarios precipitation projections. In the future, more detailed statistical comparisons could further reinforce the proposition.",
