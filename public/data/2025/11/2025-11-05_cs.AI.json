        "abstract": "As artificial intelligence (AI) advances toward superhuman capabilities, aligning these systems with human values becomes increasingly critical. Current alignment strategies rely largely on externally specified constraints that may prove insufficient against future super-intelligent AI capable of circumventing top-down controls. This research investigates whether artificial neural networks (ANNs) can develop patterns analogous to biological mirror neurons cells that activate both when performing and observing actions, and how such patterns might contribute to intrinsic alignment in AI. Mirror neurons play a crucial role in empathy, imitation, and social cognition in humans. The study therefore asks: (1) Can simple ANNs develop mirror-neuron patterns? and (2) How might these patterns contribute to ethical and cooperative decision-making in AI systems? Using a novel Frog and Toad game framework designed to promote cooperative behaviors, we identify conditions under which mirror-neuron patterns emerge, evaluate their influence on action circuits, introduce the Checkpoint Mirror Neuron Index (CMNI) to quantify activation strength and consistency, and propose a theoretical framework for further study. Our findings indicate that appropriately scaled model capacities and self/other coupling foster shared neural representations in ANNs similar to biological mirror neurons. These empathy-like circuits support cooperative behavior and suggest that intrinsic motivations modeled through mirror-neuron dynamics could complement existing alignment techniques by embedding empathy-like mechanisms directly within AI architectures.",

Despite advances in machine learning and automation, conventional models remain confined to virtual domains, while real-world experiment and manufacture still rely on human supervision and expertise. This gap between machine intelligence and physical execution limits reproducibility, scalability, and accessibility across scientific and manufacture workflows. Here, we introduce human-AI co-embodied intelligence, a new form of physical AI that unites human users, agentic AI, and wearable hardware into an integrated system for real-world experiment and intelligent manufacture. In this paradigm, humans provide precise execution and control, while agentic AI contributes memory, contextual reasoning, adaptive planning, and real-time feedback. The wearable interface continuously captures the experimental and manufacture processes, facilitates seamless communication between humans and AI for corrective guidance and interpretable collaboration. As a demonstration, we present Agentic-Physical Experimentation (APEX) system, coupling agentic reasoning with physical execution through mixed-reality. APEX observes and interprets human actions, aligns them with standard operating procedures, provides 3D visual guidance, and analyzes every step. Implemented in a cleanroom for flexible electronics fabrication, APEX system achieves context-aware reasoning with accuracy exceeding general multimodal large language models, corrects errors in real time, and transfers expertise to beginners. These results establish a new class of agentic-physical-human intelligence that extends agentic reasoning beyond computation into the physical domain, transforming scientific research and manufacturing into autonomous, traceable, interpretable, and scalable processes.",

In this paper, we demonstrate how current foundation models can effectively search over a space of reward functions to produce desirable RL agents for the Gran Turismo 7 racing game, given only text-based instructions. Through a combination of LLM-based reward generation, VLM preference-based evaluation, and human feedback we demonstrate how our system can be used to produce racing agents competitive with GT Sophy, a champion-level RL racing agent, as well as generate novel behaviors, paving the way for practical automated reward design in real world applications.",

        "abstract": "We introduce the Deep Value Benchmark (DVB), an evaluation framework that directly tests whether large language models (LLMs) learn fundamental human values or merely surface-level preferences. This distinction is critical for AI alignment: Systems that capture deeper values are likely to generalize human intentions robustly, while those that capture only superficial patterns in preference data risk producing misaligned behavior. The DVB uses a novel experimental design with controlled confounding between deep values (e.g., moral principles) and shallow features (e.g., superficial attributes). In the training phase, we expose LLMs to human preference data with deliberately correlated deep and shallow features -- for instance, where a user consistently prefers (non-maleficence, formal language) options over (justice, informal language) alternatives. The testing phase then breaks these correlations, presenting choices between (justice, formal language) and (non-maleficence, informal language) options. This design allows us to precisely measure a model's Deep Value Generalization Rate (DVGR) -- the probability of generalizing based on the underlying value rather than the shallow feature. Across 9 different models, the average DVGR is just 0.30. All models generalize deep values less than chance. Larger models have a (slightly) lower DVGR than smaller models. We are releasing our dataset, which was subject to three separate human validation experiments. DVB provides an interpretable measure of a core feature of alignment.",

However, participation rates among at-risk populations in the United States remain strikingly low. This gap underscores the need to understand and model the behavioral mechanisms underlying insurance decisions. Large language models (LLMs) have recently exhibited human-like intelligence across wide-ranging tasks, offering promising tools for simulating human decision-making. This study constructs a benchmark dataset to capture insurance purchase probabilities across factors. Using this dataset, the capacity of LLMs is evaluated: while LLMs exhibit a qualitative understanding of factors, they fall short in estimating quantitative probabilities. To address this limitation, InsurAgent, an LLM-empowered agent comprising five modules including perception, retrieval, reasoning, action, and memory, is proposed. The retrieval module leverages retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to ground decisions in empirical survey data, achieving accurate estimation of marginal and bivariate probabilities. The reasoning module leverages LLM common sense to extrapolate beyond survey data, capturing contextual information that is intractable for traditional models. The memory module supports the simulation of temporal decision evolutions, illustrated through a roller coaster life trajectory. Overall, InsurAgent provides a valuable tool for behavioral modeling and policy analysis.",

This gap arises from the uniqueness of the individual decision-making process, shaped by numerical attributes (e.g., cost, time) and linguistic influences (e.g., personal preferences and constraints). Developing upon Utility Theory and leveraging the textual-reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), this paper proposes an Adaptive Textual-symbolic Human-centric Reasoning framework (ATHENA) to address the optimal information integration. ATHENA uniquely integrates two stages: First, it discovers robust, group-level symbolic utility functions via LLM-augmented symbolic discovery; Second, it implements individual-level semantic adaptation, creating personalized semantic templates guided by the optimal utility to model personalized choices. Validated on real-world travel mode and vaccine choice tasks, ATHENA consistently outperforms utility-based, machine learning, and other LLM-based models, lifting F1 score by at least 6.5% over the strongest cutting-edge models. Further, ablation studies confirm that both stages of ATHENA are critical and complementary, as removing either clearly degrades overall predictive performance. By organically integrating symbolic utility modeling and semantic adaptation, ATHENA provides a new scheme for modeling human-centric decisions. The project page can be found at this https URL.",

Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their potential to generate novel research ideas by leveraging large-scale scientific literature. However, previous work in research ideation has primarily relied on simplistic methods, such as keyword co-occurrence or semantic similarity. These approaches focus on identifying statistical associations in the literature but overlook the complex, contextual relationships between scientific concepts, which are essential to effectively leverage knowledge embedded in human literature. For instance, papers that simultaneously mention \"keyword A\" and \"keyword B\" often present research ideas that integrate both concepts. Additionally, some LLM-driven methods propose and refine research ideas using the model's internal knowledge, but they fail to effectively utilize the scientific concept network, limiting the grounding of ideas in established research. To address these challenges, we propose the Deep Ideation framework to address these challenges, integrating a scientific network that captures keyword co-occurrence and contextual relationships, enriching LLM-driven ideation. The framework introduces an explore-expand-evolve workflow to iteratively refine research ideas, using an Idea Stack to track progress. A critic engine, trained on real-world reviewer feedback, guides the process by providing continuous feedback on the novelty and feasibility of ideas. Our experiments show that our approach improves the quality of generated ideas by 10.67% compared to other methods, with ideas surpassing top conference acceptance levels. Human evaluation highlights their practical value in scientific research, and ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each component in the workflow. Code repo is available at this https URL.",

To validate this framework, we construct a controllable dataset that systematically varies the reasoning difficulty of visual and textual inputs. Using entropy as a fine-grained uncertainty metric, we uncover a universal law: the probability of following a modality decreases monotonically as its relative uncertainty increases. At the relative difficulty level where the model tends to follow both modalities with comparable probability what we call the balance point, a practical indicator of the model's inherent preference. Unlike traditional macro-level ratios, this measure offers a more principled and less confounded way to characterize modality bias, disentangling it from unimodal capabilities and dataset artifacts. Further, by probing layer-wise predictions, we reveal the internal mechanism of oscillation: in ambiguous regions near the balance point, models vacillate between modalities across layers, explaining externally observed indecision. Together, these findings establish relative uncertainty and inherent preference as the two governing principles of modality following, offering both a quantitative framework and mechanistic insight into how MLLMs resolve conflicting information.",

Recent work extends this paradigm to a multi-agent setting, where a meta-thinking agent proposes plans and monitors progress while a reasoning agent executes subtasks through sequential conversational turns. Despite promising performance, we identify a critical limitation: lazy agent behavior, in which one agent dominates while the other contributes little, undermining collaboration and collapsing the setup to an ineffective single agent. In this paper, we first provide a theoretical analysis showing why lazy behavior naturally arises in multi-agent reasoning. We then introduce a stable and efficient method for measuring causal influence, helping mitigate this issue. Finally, as collaboration intensifies, the reasoning agent risks getting lost in multi-turn interactions and trapped by previous noisy responses. To counter this, we propose a verifiable reward mechanism that encourages deliberation by allowing the reasoning agent to discard noisy outputs, consolidate instructions, and restart its reasoning process when necessary. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework alleviates lazy agent behavior and unlocks the full potential of multi-agent framework for complex reasoning tasks.",

However, most existing methods still struggle with complex, long-horizon tasks because they rely on a monolithic trajectory that entangles all past decisions and observations, attempting to solve the entire task in a single unified process. To address this limitation, we propose ReAcTree, a hierarchical task-planning method that decomposes a complex goal into more manageable subgoals within a dynamically constructed agent tree. Each subgoal is handled by an LLM agent node capable of reasoning, acting, and further expanding the tree, while control flow nodes coordinate the execution strategies of agent nodes. In addition, we integrate two complementary memory systems: each agent node retrieves goal-specific, subgoal-level examples from episodic memory and shares environment-specific observations through working memory. Experiments on the WAH-NL and ALFRED datasets demonstrate that ReAcTree consistently outperforms strong task-planning baselines such as ReAct across diverse LLMs. Notably, on WAH-NL, ReAcTree achieves a 61% goal success rate with Qwen 2.5 72B, nearly doubling ReAct's 31%.",

However, for open-ended tasks lacking ground-truth solutions (e.g., creative writing and instruction following), existing studies typically regard them as non-reasoning scenarios, thereby overlooking the latent value of reasoning capabilities. This raises a key question: Can strengthening reasoning improve performance in open-ended tasks? To address this, we explore the transfer of the RLVR paradigm to the open domain. Yet, since RLVR fundamentally relies on verifiers that presuppose the existence of standard answers, it cannot be directly applied to open-ended tasks. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Verifiable Multiple-Choice Reformulation (VMR), a novel training strategy that restructures open-ended data into verifiable multiple-choice formats, enabling effective training even in the absence of explicit ground truth. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our method in improving LLM performance on open-ended tasks. Notably, across eight open-ended benchmarks, our VMR-based training delivers an average gain of 5.99 points over the baseline. Code will be released upon acceptance to facilitate reproducibility.",

This will lead to a new generation of AI systems that autonomously decompose goals, retain context over time, learn continuously, operate across tools and environments, and adapt dynamically. The complexity of 5G and upcoming 6G networks renders manual optimization ineffective, pointing to Agentic AI as a method for automating decisions in dynamic RAN environments. However, despite its rapid advances, there is no established framework outlining the foundational components and operational principles of Agentic AI systems nor a universally accepted definition. This paper contributes to ongoing research on Agentic AI in 5G and 6G networks by outlining its core concepts and then proposing a practical use case that applies Agentic principles to RAN optimization. We first introduce Agentic AI, tracing its evolution from classical agents and discussing the progress from workflows and simple AI agents to Agentic AI. Core design patterns-reflection, planning, tool use, and multi-agent collaboration-are then described to illustrate how intelligent behaviors are orchestrated. These theorical concepts are grounded in the context of mobile networks, with a focus on RAN management and optimization. A practical 5G RAN case study shows how time-series analytics and LAM-driven agents collaborate for KPI-based autonomous decision-making.",

To address this challenge, this paper proposes a KLPEG framework. The framework constructs and maintains a Knowledge Graph (KG) to systematically model game elements, task dependencies, and causal relationships, enabling knowledge accumulation and reuse across versions. Building on this foundation, the framework utilizes LLMs to parse natural language update logs, identify the scope of impact through multi-hop reasoning on the KG, enabling the generation of update-tailored test cases. Experiments in two representative game environments, Overcooked and Minecraft, demonstrate that KLPEG can more accurately locate functionalities affected by updates and complete tests in fewer steps, significantly improving both playtesting effectiveness and efficiency.",

Classical shielding approaches, however, are often static, in the sense that they assume fixed logical specifications and hand-crafted abstractions. While these static shields provide safety under nominal assumptions, they fail to adapt when environment assumptions are violated. In this paper, we develop the first adaptive shielding framework - to the best of our knowledge - based on Generalized Reactivity of rank 1 (GR(1)) specifications, a tractable and expressive fragment of Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) that captures both safety and liveness properties. Our method detects environment assumption violations at runtime and employs Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) to automatically repair GR(1) specifications online, in a systematic and interpretable way. This ensures that the shield evolves gracefully, ensuring liveness is achievable and weakening goals only when necessary. We consider two case studies: Minepump and Atari Seaquest; showing that (i) static symbolic controllers are often severely suboptimal when optimizing for auxiliary rewards, and (ii) RL agents equipped with our adaptive shield maintain near-optimal reward and perfect logical compliance compared with static shields.",

The generation of DecompSR allows users to independently vary several aspects of compositionality, namely: productivity (reasoning depth), substitutivity (entity and linguistic variability), overgeneralisation (input order, distractors) and systematicity (novel linguistic elements). DecompSR is built procedurally in a manner which makes it is correct by construction, which is independently verified using a symbolic solver to guarantee the correctness of the dataset. DecompSR is comprehensively benchmarked across a host of Large Language Models (LLMs) where we show that LLMs struggle with productive and systematic generalisation in spatial reasoning tasks whereas they are more robust to linguistic variation. DecompSR provides a provably correct and rigorous benchmarking dataset with a novel ability to independently vary the degrees of several key aspects of compositionality, allowing for robust and fine-grained probing of the compositional reasoning abilities of LLMs.",

        "abstract": "The trajectory of AI development suggests that we will increasingly rely on agent-based systems composed of independently developed agents with different information, privileges, and tools. The success of these systems will critically depend on effective collaboration among these heterogeneous agents, even under partial observability. Despite intense interest, few empirical studies have evaluated such agent-agent collaboration at scale. We propose a collaborative maze-solving benchmark that (i) isolates collaborative capabilities, (ii) modulates problem complexity, (iii) enables scalable automated grading, and (iv) imposes no output-format constraints, preserving ecological plausibility. Using this framework, we evaluate 32 leading open- and closed-source models in solo, homogeneous, and heterogeneous pairings. Our results reveal a \"collaboration gap\": models that perform well solo often degrade substantially when required to collaborate. Collaboration can break down dramatically; for instance, small distilled models that solve mazes well alone may fail almost completely in certain pairings. We find that starting with the stronger agent often improves outcomes, motivating a \"relay inference\" approach where the stronger agent leads before handing off to the weaker one, closing much of the gap. Our findings argue for (1) collaboration-aware evaluation, (2) training strategies developed to enhance collaborative capabilities, and (3) interaction design that reliably elicits agents' latent skills, guidance that applies to AI-AI and human-AI collaboration.",

This neglects a crucial capability: agents' ability to devise and adjust cost-optimal plans in response to changing environments. To bridge this gap, we introduce CostBench, a scalable, cost-centric benchmark designed to evaluate agents' economic reasoning and replanning abilities. Situated in the travel-planning domain, CostBench comprises tasks solvable via multiple sequences of atomic and composite tools with diverse, customizable costs. It also supports four types of dynamic blocking events, such as tool failures and cost changes, to simulate real-world unpredictability and necessitate agents to adapt in real time. Evaluating leading open-sourced and proprietary models on CostBench reveals a substantial gap in cost-aware planning: agents frequently fail to identify cost-optimal solutions in static settings, with even GPT-5 achieving less than 75% exact match rate on the hardest tasks, and performance further dropping by around 40% under dynamic conditions. By diagnosing these weaknesses, CostBench lays the groundwork for developing future agents that are both economically rational and robust.",

At the same time, inference servers remain heavily optimized for chat completion. Prior work has shown that large improvements to KV cache hit rate are possible if inference servers evolve towards these non-chat use cases. However, they offer solutions that are also optimized for a single use case, RAG. In this paper, we introduce the span query to generalize the interface to the inference server. We demonstrate that chat, RAG, inference-time scaling, and agentic workloads can all be expressed as span queries. We show how the critical distinction that had been assumed by prior work lies in whether the order of the inputs matter -- do they commute? In chat, they do not. In RAG, they often do. This paper introduces span queries, which are expression trees of inference calls, linked together with commutativity constraints. We describe span query syntax and semantics. We show how they can be automatically optimized to improve KV cache locality. We show how a small change to vLLM (affecting only 492 lines) can enable high-performance execution of span queries. Using this stack, we demonstrate that span queries can achieve 10-20x reductions in TTFT for two distinct non-chat use cases. Finally, we show that span queries can also be optimized to improve attention locality, so as to avoid the so-called lost-in-the-middle problem. We demonstrate that an attention-optimized span query on a 2b parameter model vastly outperforms the accuracy of a stock inference server using an 8b model.",

In this paper, we introduce modality sabotage, a diagnostic failure mode in which a high-confidence unimodal error overrides other evidence and misleads the fused result. To analyze such dynamics, we propose a lightweight, model-agnostic evaluation layer that treats each modality as an agent, producing candidate labels and a brief self-assessment used for auditing. A simple fusion mechanism aggregates these outputs, exposing contributors (modalities supporting correct outcomes) and saboteurs (modalities that mislead). Applying our diagnostic layer in a case study on multimodal emotion recognition benchmarks with foundation models revealed systematic reliability profiles, providing insight into whether failures may arise from dataset artifacts or model limitations. More broadly, our framework offers a diagnostic scaffold for multimodal reasoning, supporting principled auditing of fusion dynamics and informing possible interventions.",

Yet, developing effective neural models for tabular data remains challenging due to heterogeneous feature types and complex interactions occurring at multiple scales. Recent advances in tabular in-context learning (ICL), such as TabPFN and TabICL, have achieved state-of-the-art performance comparable to gradient-boosted trees (GBTs) without task-specific fine-tuning. However, current architectures exhibit key limitations: (1) single-scale feature processing that overlooks hierarchical dependencies, (2) dense attention with quadratic scaling in table width, and (3) strictly sequential component processing that prevents iterative representation refinement and cross-component communication. To address these challenges, we introduce Orion-MSP, a tabular ICL architecture featuring three key innovations: (1) multi-scale processing to capture hierarchical feature interactions; (2) block-sparse attention combining windowed, global, and random patterns for scalable efficiency and long-range connectivity; and (3) a Perceiver-style memory enabling safe bidirectional information flow across components. Across diverse benchmarks, Orion-MSP matches or surpasses state-of-the-art performance while scaling effectively to high-dimensional tables, establishing a new standard for efficient tabular in-context learning.

In this work, we show how to optimize attack policies in SHADE-Arena, a dataset of diverse realistic control environments. We do this by decomposing attack capability into five constituent skills -- suspicion modeling, attack selection, plan synthesis, execution and subtlety -- and optimizing each component individually. To get around the constraint of limited data, we develop a probabilistic model of attack dynamics, optimize our attack hyperparameters using this simulation, and then show that the results transfer to SHADE-Arena. This results in a substantial improvement in attack strength, reducing safety score from a baseline of 0.87 to 0.41 using our scaffold.",

Substantial progress has been made towards AI agents that can automate scientific research, but all such agents remain limited in the number of actions they can take before losing coherence, thus limiting the depth of their findings. Here we present Kosmos, an AI scientist that automates data-driven discovery. Given an open-ended objective and a dataset, Kosmos runs for up to 12 hours performing cycles of parallel data analysis, literature search, and hypothesis generation before synthesizing discoveries into scientific reports. Unlike prior systems, Kosmos uses a structured world model to share information between a data analysis agent and a literature search agent. The world model enables Kosmos to coherently pursue the specified objective over 200 agent rollouts, collectively executing an average of 42,000 lines of code and reading 1,500 papers per run. Kosmos cites all statements in its reports with code or primary literature, ensuring its reasoning is traceable. Independent scientists found 79.4% of statements in Kosmos reports to be accurate, and collaborators reported that a single 20-cycle Kosmos run performed the equivalent of 6 months of their own research time on average. Furthermore, collaborators reported that the number of valuable scientific findings generated scales linearly with Kosmos cycles (tested up to 20 cycles). We highlight seven discoveries made by Kosmos that span metabolomics, materials science, neuroscience, and statistical genetics. Three discoveries independently reproduce findings from preprinted or unpublished manuscripts that were not accessed by Kosmos at runtime, while four make novel contributions to the scientific literature.",

Yet, this new language lacks semantics, which makes AI's scientific discoveries unsatisfactory at best. With the purpose of uncovering new facts but also improving our understanding of the world, AI-based science requires formalization through a framework capable of translating insight into comprehensible scientific knowledge. In this paper, we argue that logic offers an adequate framework. In particular, we use logic in a neurosymbolic framework to offer a much needed semantics for deep learning, the neural network-based technology of current AI. Deep learning and neurosymbolic AI lack a general set of conditions to ensure that desirable properties are satisfied. Instead, there is a plethora of encoding and knowledge extraction approaches designed for particular cases. To rectify this, we introduced a framework for semantic encoding, making explicit the mapping between neural networks and logic, and characterizing the common ingredients of the various existing approaches. In this paper, we describe succinctly and exemplify how logical semantics and neural networks are linked through this framework, we review some of the most prominent approaches and techniques developed for neural encoding and knowledge extraction, provide a formal definition of our framework, and discuss some of the difficulties of identifying a semantic encoding in practice in light of analogous problems in the philosophy of mind.",

The master agent interprets user intent, delegates subtasks to modality-specific agents, and integrates their outputs into coherent responses. Extensive experiments across text, image, audio, video, and omni benchmarks show that Agent-Omni consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly on tasks requiring complex cross-modal reasoning. Its agent-based design enables seamless integration of specialized foundation models, ensuring adaptability to diverse inputs while maintaining transparency and interpretability. In addition, the framework is modular and easily extensible, allowing future improvements as stronger models become available. %We release an open-source implementation to support continued research on scalable and reliable omni-modal reasoning.",

We addressed this issue by creating a comprehensive dataset with fine-grained labels of scam messages, including both original and adversarial scam messages. The dataset extended traditional binary classes for the scam detection task into more nuanced scam types. Our analysis showed how adversarial examples took advantage of vulnerabilities of a LLM, leading to high misclassification rate. We evaluated the performance of LLMs on these adversarial scam messages and proposed strategies to improve their robustness.",

        "abstract": "Edge intelligence paradigm is increasingly demanded by the emerging autonomous systems, such as robotics. Beyond ensuring privacy-preserving operation and resilience in connectivity-limited environments, edge deployment offers significant energy and cost advantages over cloud-based solutions. However, deploying large language models (LLMs) for reasoning tasks on edge GPUs faces critical challenges from strict latency constraints and limited computational resources. To navigate these constraints, developers must balance multiple design factors - choosing reasoning versus non-reasoning architectures, selecting appropriate model sizes, allocating token budgets, and applying test-time scaling strategies - to meet target latency and optimize accuracy. Yet guidance on optimal combinations of these variables remains scarce. In this work, we present EdgeReasoning, a comprehensive study characterizing the deployment of reasoning LLMs on edge GPUs. We systematically quantify latency-accuracy tradeoffs across various LLM architectures and model sizes. We systematically evaluate prompt-based and model-tuning-based techniques for reducing reasoning token length while maintaining performance quality. We further profile test-time scaling methods with varying degrees of parallelism to maximize accuracy under strict latency budgets. Through these analyses, EdgeReasoning maps the Pareto frontier of achievable accuracy-latency configurations, offering systematic guidance for optimal edge deployment of reasoning LLMs.",

        "abstract": "Millimeter-wave (mmWave) and Terahertz (THz)-band communications hold great promise in meeting the growing data-rate demands of next-generation wireless networks, offering abundant bandwidth. To mitigate the severe path loss inherent to these high frequencies and reduce hardware costs, ultra-massive multiple-input multiple-output (UM-MIMO) systems with hybrid beamforming architectures can deliver substantial beamforming gains and enhanced spectral efficiency. However, accurate channel estimation (CE) in mmWave and THz UM-MIMO systems is challenging due to high channel dimensionality and compressed observations from a limited number of RF chains, while the hybrid near- and far-field radiation patterns, arising from large array apertures and high carrier frequencies, further complicate CE. Conventional compressive sensing based frameworks rely on predefined sparsifying matrices, which cannot faithfully capture the hybrid near-field and far-field channel structures, leading to degraded estimation performance. This paper introduces DiffPace, a diffusion-based plug-and-play method for channel estimation. DiffPace uses a diffusion model (DM) to capture the channel distribution based on the hybrid spherical and planar-wave (HPSM) model. By applying the plug-and-play approach, it leverages the DM as prior knowledge, improving CE accuracy. Moreover, DM performs inference by solving an ordinary differential equation, minimizing the number of required inference steps compared with stochastic sampling method. Experimental results show that DiffPace achieves competitive CE performance, attaining -15 dB normalized mean square error (NMSE) at a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 10 dB, with 90\\% fewer inference steps compared to state-of-the-art schemes, simultaneously providing high estimation precision and enhanced computational efficiency.",

However, manual kernel design is both costly and time-consuming, motivating automatic approaches that leverage LLMs for code generation. Existing methods for automatic kernel generation, however, often produce low-efficiency kernels, incur high computational overhead, and fail to generalize across settings. In this work, we propose CudaForge, a training-free multi-agent workflow for CUDA kernel generation and optimization. Our workflow is inspired by the iterative workflow of human experts, which contains steps such as developing initial kernels, testing correctness, analyzing hardware feedback, and iterative improvement. More specifically, CudaForge employs two LLM agents: a Coder and a Judge, that iteratively generate, correct, and optimize CUDA kernels, while integrating hardware feedback such as Nsight Compute (NCU) metrics. In extensive evaluations, we show that CudaForge, by leveraging base models like OpenAI-o3, achieves 97.6\\% correctness of generated kernels and an average 1.68$\\times$ speedup over PyTorch baselines, substantially surpassing state-of-the-art models including OpenAI-o3 and Kevin on KernelBench. Beyond accuracy and speed, CudaForge demonstrates strong generalization across GPUs (A100, RTX 6000, 4090, 3090) and base models (OpenAI-o3, GPT-5, gpt-oss-120B, Claude-Sonnet-4, QwQ-32B), while maintaining high efficiency. In particular, generating an optimized kernel takes about 26.5 minutes on one RTX6000 and incurs about \\$ 0.3 API cost, which is significantly cheaper than existing agentic work that costs 6 H100 hours and \\$ 5 API cost per kernel. Our results highlight that multi-agent, training-free workflows can enable cost-effective, generalizable, and high-performance CUDA kernel optimization. Code available at this https URL",

To implement MPG efficiently, we design Speculative Chunk-level based Rejection sampling (SCR), which generates responses in chunks and parallelly validates them via estimated thresholds within a sliding window. This significantly reduces computational overhead while maintaining high-quality generation.

To address these issues, we propose LGCC, a novel framework with two key components: Local Gaussian Noise Coupling (LGNC) and Content Consistency Loss (CCL). LGNC preserves spatial details by modeling target image embeddings and their locally perturbed counterparts as coupled pairs, while CCL ensures semantic alignment between edit instructions and image modifications, preventing unintended content removal. By integrating LGCC with the BAGEL pre-trained model via curriculum learning, we significantly reduce inference steps, improving local detail scores on I2EBench by 1.60% and overall scores by 0.53%. LGCC achieves 3x -- 5x speedup for lightweight editing and 2x for universal editing, requiring only 40% -- 50% of the inference time of BAGEL or Flux. These results demonstrate LGCC's ability to preserve detail, maintain contextual integrity, and enhance inference speed, offering a cost-efficient solution without compromising editing quality.",

We propose two foundational design principles, Transparent Design and Operable Design, that operationalize pre-clinical technical requirements for healthcare AI. Transparent Design encompasses interpretability and understandability artifacts that enable case-level reasoning and system traceability. Operable Design encompasses calibration, uncertainty, and robustness to ensure reliable, predictable system behavior under real-world conditions. We ground these principles in established XAI frameworks, map them to documented clinician needs, and demonstrate their alignment with emerging governance requirements. This pre-clinical playbook provides actionable guidance for development teams, accelerates the path to clinical evaluation, and establishes a shared vocabulary bridging AI researchers, healthcare practitioners, and regulatory stakeholders. By explicitly scoping what can be built and verified before clinical deployment, we aim to reduce friction in clinical AI translation while remaining cautious about what constitutes validated, deployed explainability.",

Although the name for such roles may differ between institutions, the underlying idea of providing structured supplementary support is common. However, these roles were often poorly defined, lacking structured materials, pedagogical oversight, and integration with the core teaching team. This paper reports on the redesign of reinforcement sessions in a challenging undergraduate course on formal methods and computational models, using a large language model (LLM) as a reflective planning tool. The LLM was prompted to simulate the perspective of a second-year student, enabling the identification of conceptual bottlenecks, gaps in intuition, and likely reasoning breakdowns before classroom delivery. These insights informed a structured, repeatable session format combining targeted review, collaborative examples, independent student work, and guided walkthroughs. Conducted over a single semester, the intervention received positive student feedback, indicating increased confidence, reduced anxiety, and improved clarity, particularly in abstract topics such as the pumping lemma and formal language expressive power comparisons. The findings suggest that reflective, instructor-facing use of LLMs can enhance pedagogical design in theoretically dense domains and may be adaptable to other cognitively demanding computer science courses.",

Inspired by working memory model in cognitive psychology, we present EvoMem, a multi-agent framework built on a dual-evolving memory mechanism. The framework consists of three agents (Constraint Extractor, Verifier, and Actor) and two memory modules: Constraint Memory (CMem), which evolves across queries by storing task-specific rules and constraints while remains fixed within a query, and Query-feedback Memory (QMem), which evolves within a query by accumulating feedback across iterations for solution refinement. Both memory modules are reset at the end of each query session. Evaluations on trip planning, meeting planning, and calendar scheduling show consistent performance improvements, highlighting the effectiveness of EvoMem. This success underscores the importance of memory in enhancing multi-agent planning.",

Inspired by Green's functions, the solution operators of linear PDEs that depend exclusively on the domain geometry, we design Neural Green's Function to imitate their behavior, achieving superior generalization across diverse irregular geometries and source and boundary functions. Specifically, Neural Green's Function extracts per-point features from a volumetric point cloud representing the problem domain and uses them to predict a decomposition of the solution operator, which is subsequently applied to evaluate solutions via numerical integration. Unlike recent learning-based solution operators, which often struggle to generalize to unseen source or boundary functions, our framework is, by design, agnostic to the specific functions used during training, enabling robust and efficient generalization. In the steady-state thermal analysis of mechanical part geometries from the MCB dataset, Neural Green's Function outperforms state-of-the-art neural operators, achieving an average error reduction of 13.9\\% across five shape categories, while being up to 350 times faster than a numerical solver that requires computationally expensive meshing.",

        "abstract": "Solving large-scale Generalized Eigenvalue Problems (GEPs) is a fundamental yet computationally prohibitive task in science and engineering. As a promising direction, contour integral (CI) methods, such as the CIRR algorithm, offer an efficient and parallelizable framework. However, their performance is critically dependent on the selection of integration contours -- improper selection without reliable prior knowledge of eigenvalue distribution can incur significant computational overhead and compromise numerical accuracy. To address this challenge, we propose DeepContour, a novel hybrid framework that integrates a deep learning-based spectral predictor with Kernel Density Estimation for principled contour design. Specifically, DeepContour first employs a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) to rapidly predict the spectral distribution of a given GEP. Subsequently, Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) is applied to the predicted spectrum to automatically and systematically determine proper integration contours. Finally, these optimized contours guide the CI solver to efficiently find the desired eigenvalues. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on diverse challenging scientific problems. In our main experiments, DeepContour accelerates GEP solving across multiple datasets, achieving up to a 5.63$\\times$ speedup. By combining the predictive power of deep learning with the numerical rigor of classical solvers, this work pioneers an efficient and robust paradigm for tackling difficult generalized eigenvalue involving matrices of high dimension.",

        "abstract": "Human mobility generation in disaster scenarios plays a vital role in resource allocation, emergency response, and rescue coordination. During disasters such as wildfires and hurricanes, human mobility patterns often deviate from their normal states, which makes the task more challenging. However, existing works usually rely on limited data from a single city or specific disaster, significantly restricting the model's generalization capability in new scenarios. In fact, disasters are highly sudden and unpredictable, and any city may encounter new types of disasters without prior experience. Therefore, we aim to develop a one-for-all model for mobility generation that can generalize to new disaster scenarios. However, building a universal framework faces two key challenges: 1) the diversity of disaster types and 2) the heterogeneity among different cities. In this work, we propose a unified model for human mobility generation in natural disasters (named UniDisMob). To enable cross-disaster generalization, we design physics-informed prompt and physics-guided alignment that leverage the underlying common patterns in mobility changes after different disasters to guide the generation process. To achieve cross-city generalization, we introduce a meta-learning framework that extracts universal patterns across multiple cities through shared parameters and captures city-specific features via private parameters. Extensive experiments across multiple cities and disaster scenarios demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving an average performance improvement exceeding 13%.",

However, directly using real-world trajectory data often faces challenges such as privacy concerns, data acquisition costs, and data quality. A practical solution to these challenges is trajectory generation, a method developed to simulate human mobility behaviors. Existing trajectory generation methods mainly focus on capturing individual movement patterns but often overlook the influence of population distribution on trajectory generation. In reality, dynamic population distribution reflects changes in population density across different regions, significantly impacting individual mobility behavior. Thus, we propose a novel trajectory generation framework based on a diffusion model, which integrates the dynamic population distribution constraints to guide high-fidelity generation outcomes. Specifically, we construct a spatial graph to enhance the spatial correlation of trajectories. Then, we design a dynamic population distribution aware denoising network to capture the spatiotemporal dependencies of human mobility behavior as well as the impact of population distribution in the denoising process. Extensive experiments show that the trajectories generated by our model can resemble real-world trajectories in terms of some critical statistical metrics, outperforming state-of-the-art algorithms by over 54%.",

The current supervised fine-tuning paradigm relies on constructing extensive domain-specific datasets to train models.

Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm can endow LLMs with superior reasoning and generalization abilities. In this work, we address a key question: Can the pure RL be used to effectively elicit a model's intrinsic reasoning capabilities and enhance the tool-agnostic generalization? We propose a dynamic generalization-guided reward design for rule-based RL, which progressively shifts rewards from exploratory to exploitative tool-use patterns. Based on this design, we introduce the Tool-Zero series models. These models are trained to enable LLMs to autonomously utilize general tools by directly scaling up RL from Zero models (i.e., base models without post-training). Experimental results demonstrate that our models achieve over 7% performance improvement compared to both SFT and RL-with-SFT models under the same experimental settings. These gains are consistently replicated across cross-dataset and intra-dataset evaluations, validating the effectiveness and robustness of our methods.",

This study introduces a new, systematic model based on machine learning (ML) to make this process more objective. Utilizing a dataset derived from five fundamental qualitative research approaches - namely, Case Study, Grounded Theory, Phenomenology, Narrative Research, and Ethnographic Research - we developed an ensemble learning model. Ten critical parameters, including research scope, information power, and researcher competence, were evaluated using an ordinal scale and used as input features. After thorough preprocessing and outlier removal, multiple ML algorithms were trained and compared. The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Gradient Boosting (GB), Random Forest (RF), XGBoost, and Decision Tree (DT) algorithms showed the highest explanatory power (Test R2 ~ 0.85), effectively modeling the complex, non-linear relationships involved in qualitative sampling decisions. Feature importance analysis confirmed the vital roles of research design type and information power, providing quantitative validation of key theoretical assumptions in qualitative methodology. The study concludes by proposing a conceptual framework for a web-based computational application designed to serve as a decision support system for qualitative researchers, journal reviewers, and thesis advisors. This model represents a significant step toward standardizing sample size justification, enhancing transparency, and strengthening the epistemological foundation of qualitative inquiry through evidence-based, systematic decision-making.",

Previous research has linked this delayed generalization to representation learning driven by weight decay, but the precise underlying dynamics remain elusive. In this paper, we argue that post-memorization learning can be understood through the lens of constrained optimization: gradient descent effectively minimizes the weight norm on the zero-loss manifold. We formally prove this in the limit of infinitesimally small learning rates and weight decay coefficients. To further dissect this regime, we introduce an approximation that decouples the learning dynamics of a subset of parameters from the rest of the network. Applying this framework, we derive a closed-form expression for the post-memorization dynamics of the first layer in a two-layer network. Experiments confirm that simulating the training process using our predicted gradients reproduces both the delayed generalization and representation learning characteristic of grokking.",

Empowered by large-scale parameters, these models often exhibit strong memorization of their training data, rendering them susceptible to membership inference attacks (MIAs). Existing MIA methods for LVLMs typically operate under white- or gray-box assumptions, by extracting likelihood-based features for the suspected data samples based on the target LVLMs. However, mainstream LVLMs generally only expose generated outputs while concealing internal computational features during inference, limiting the applicability of these methods. In this work, we propose the first black-box MIA framework for LVLMs, based on a prior knowledge-calibrated memory probing mechanism. The core idea is to assess the model memorization of the private semantic information embedded within the suspected image data, which is unlikely to be inferred from general world knowledge alone. We conducted extensive experiments across four LVLMs and three datasets. Empirical results demonstrate that our method effectively identifies training data of LVLMs in a purely black-box setting and even achieves performance comparable to gray-box and white-box methods. Further analysis reveals the robustness of our method against potential adversarial manipulations, and the effectiveness of the methodology designs.

        "abstract": "The debate over whether \"thinking machines\" could replace human intellectual labor has existed in both public and expert discussions since the mid-twentieth century, when the concept and terminology of Artificial Intelligence (AI) first emerged. For decades, this idea remained largely theoretical. However, with the recent advent of Generative AI - particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) - and the widespread adoption of tools such as ChatGPT, the issue has become a practical reality. Many fields that rely on human intellectual effort are now being reshaped by AI tools that both expand human capabilities and challenge the necessity of certain forms of work once deemed uniquely human but now easily automated. Education, somewhat unexpectedly, faces a pivotal responsibility: to devise long-term strategies for cultivating human skills that will remain relevant in an era of pervasive AI in the intellectual domain. In this context, we identify the limitations of current AI systems - especially those rooted in LLM technology - argue that the fundamental causes of these weaknesses cannot be resolved through existing methods, and propose directions within the constructivist paradigm for transforming education to preserve the long-term advantages of human intelligence over AI tools.",

        "abstract": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle to translate high-level instructions into the precise spatial affordances required for robotic manipulation. While visual Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methods exist, they are often computationally intensive. In this work, we introduce TRACE (Textual Reasoning for Affordance Coordinate Extraction), a novel methodology that integrates a textual Chain of Reasoning (CoR) into the affordance prediction process. We use this methodology to create the TRACE dataset, a large-scale collection created via an autonomous pipeline that pairs instructions with explicit textual rationales. By fine-tuning a VLM on this data, our model learns to externalize its spatial reasoning before acting. Our experiments show that our TRACE-tuned model achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching 48.1% accuracy on the primary Where2Place (W2P) benchmark (a 9.6% relative improvement) and 55.0% on the more challenging W2P(h) subset. Crucially, an ablation study demonstrates that performance scales directly with the amount of reasoning data used, confirming the CoR's effectiveness. Furthermore, analysis of the model's attention maps reveals an interpretable reasoning process where focus shifts dynamically across reasoning steps. This work shows that training VLMs to generate a textual CoR is an effective and robust strategy for enhancing the precision, reliability, and interpretability of VLM-based robot control.

To address these challenges, we propose InteracSPARQL, an interactive SPARQL query generation and refinement system that leverages natural language explanations (NLEs) to enhance user comprehension and facilitate iterative query refinement. InteracSPARQL integrates LLMs with a rule-based approach to first produce structured explanations directly from SPARQL abstract syntax trees (ASTs), followed by LLM-based linguistic refinements. Users can interactively refine queries through direct feedback or LLM-driven self-refinement, enabling the correction of ambiguous or incorrect query components in real time. We evaluate InteracSPARQL on standard benchmarks, demonstrating significant improvements in query accuracy, explanation clarity, and overall user satisfaction compared to baseline approaches. Our experiments further highlight the effectiveness of combining rule-based methods with LLM-driven refinements to create more accessible and robust SPARQL interfaces.",

However, the fundamental mechanisms enabling such harmful generalization across disparate domains remain poorly understood. In this work, we adopt a geometric perspective to study EM and demonstrate that it exhibits a fundamental cross-task linear structure in how harmful behavior is encoded across different datasets. Specifically, we find a strong convergence in EM parameters across tasks, with the fine-tuned weight updates showing relatively high cosine similarities, as well as shared lower-dimensional subspaces as measured by their principal angles and projection overlaps. Furthermore, we also show functional equivalence via linear mode connectivity, wherein interpolated models across narrow misalignment tasks maintain coherent, broadly misaligned behavior. Our results indicate that EM arises from different narrow tasks discovering the same set of shared parameter directions, suggesting that harmful behaviors may be organized into specific, predictable regions of the weight landscape. By revealing this fundamental connection between parametric geometry and behavioral outcomes, we hope our work catalyzes further research on parameter space interpretability and weight-based interventions.",

The proposed framework is a new path-coordinated framework of continual learning that unites the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory of principled plasticity bounds, statistical validation by Wilson confidence intervals, and evaluation of path quality by the use of multiple metrics. Experimental evaluation shows an average accuracy of 66.7% at the cost of 23.4% catastrophic forgetting on Split-CIFAR10, a huge improvement over the baseline and competitive performance achieved, which is very close to state-of-the-art results. Further, it is found out that NTK condition numbers are predictive indicators of learning capacity limits, showing the existence of a critical threshold at condition number $>10^{11}$. It is interesting to note that the proposed strategy shows a tendency of lowering forgetting as the sequence of tasks progresses (27% to 18%), which is a system stabilization. The framework validates 80% of discovered paths with a rigorous statistical guarantee and maintains 90-97% retention on intermediate tasks. The core capacity limits of the continual learning environment are determined in the analysis, and actionable insights to enhance the adaptive regularization are offered.",

We focus on the federated setting where the data are locally owned by decentralized clients who have their own definitions for the quality of representability. This setting requires repetitive aggregation of local information computed by the clients. While the main motivation is to respect the privacy and autonomy of the clients, the federated setting is vulnerable to client misbehaviors: malicious clients might share fake information. An analogy is backdoor attack in conventional federated learning, but our challenge differs freshly due to the unique characteristics of submodular maximization. We propose RobustFSM, a federated submodular maximization solution that is robust to various practical client attacks. Its performance is substantiated with an empirical evaluation study using real-world datasets. Numerical results show that the solution quality of RobustFSM substantially exceeds that of the conventional federated algorithm when attacks are severe. The degree of this improvement depends on the dataset and attack scenarios, which can be as high as 200%",

        "abstract": "Rare events such as financial crashes, climate extremes, and biological anomalies are notoriously difficult to model due to their scarcity and heavy-tailed distributions. Classical deep generative models often struggle to capture these rare occurrences, either collapsing low-probability modes or producing poorly calibrated uncertainty estimates. In this work, we propose the Quantum-Enhanced Generative Model (QEGM), a hybrid classical-quantum framework that integrates deep latent-variable models with variational quantum circuits. The framework introduces two key innovations: (1) a hybrid loss function that jointly optimizes reconstruction fidelity and tail-aware likelihood, and (2) quantum randomness-driven noise injection to enhance sample diversity and mitigate mode collapse. Training proceeds via a hybrid loop where classical parameters are updated through backpropagation while quantum parameters are optimized using parameter-shift gradients. We evaluate QEGM on synthetic Gaussian mixtures and real-world datasets spanning finance, climate, and protein structure. Results demonstrate that QEGM reduces tail KL divergence by up to 50 percent compared to state-of-the-art baselines (GAN, VAE, Diffusion), while improving rare-event recall and coverage calibration. These findings highlight the potential of QEGM as a principled approach for rare-event prediction, offering robustness beyond what is achievable with purely classical methods.",

We evaluate conversational response quality along three axes: naturalness, comprehensiveness, and on-topic adherence, each rated on 5-point scales. Using ensemble-generated data from multiple LLMs, we fine-tune a 7B-parameter model and test across six diverse conversational datasets. Across 18 dataset, task settings, label-plus-explanation training outperforms label-only baselines. A central and unexpected result concerns random tokens. We replace human-written explanations with text that is syntactically incoherent yet vocabulary-aligned with the originals (e.g., shuffled or bag-of-words variants). Despite lacking semantics, these pseudo-explanations still improve accuracy over label-only training and often narrow much of the gap to true explanations. The effect persists across datasets and training seeds, indicating that gains arise less from meaning than from structure: the extra token budget encourages richer intermediate computation and acts as a regularizer that reduces over-confident shortcuts. Internal analyses support this view: explanation-augmented models exhibit higher activation entropy in intermediate layers alongside sharper predictive mass at the output layer, consistent with increased deliberation before decision. Overall, explanation-augmented fine-tuning, whether with genuine rationales or carefully constructed random token sequences, improves accuracy and reliability for LLM classification while clarifying how token-level scaffolding shapes computation during inference.",

Existing ML serving platforms use batching to optimize for high throughput, exposing them to unpredictable tail latencies. Vortex enables an SLO-first approach.

We derive energy loss functions assuming that each data sample is in thermal equilibrium with respect to an approximate energy landscape. By using the reverse KL divergence with a Boltzmann distribution around the data, we obtain the loss as an energy difference between the data and the model predictions. This perspective also recasts traditional objectives like MSE as energy-based, but with a physically meaningless energy. In contrast, our formulation yields physically grounded loss functions with gradients that better align with valid configurations, while being architecture-agnostic and computationally efficient. The energy loss functions also inherently respect physical symmetries.

We propose a framework that specifies the natural building blocks for structured world models based on the fundamental stochastic processes that any world model must capture: discrete processes (logic, symbols) and continuous processes (physics, dynamics); the world model is then defined by the hierarchical composition of these building blocks. We examine Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and switching linear dynamical systems (sLDS) as natural building blocks for discrete and continuous modeling--which become partially-observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) and controlled sLDS when augmented with actions. This modular approach supports both passive modeling (generation, forecasting) and active control (planning, decision-making) within the same architecture. We avoid the combinatorial explosion of traditional structure learning by largely fixing the causal architecture and searching over only four depth parameters. We review practical expressiveness through multimodal generative modeling (passive) and planning from pixels (active), with performance competitive to neural approaches while maintaining interpretability. The core outstanding challenge is scalable joint structure-parameter learning; current methods finesse this by cleverly growing structure and parameters incrementally, but are limited in their scalability. If solved, these natural building blocks could provide foundational infrastructure for world modeling, analogous to how standardized layers enabled progress in deep learning.",

        "abstract": "Machine Learning (ML) is poised to play a pivotal role in the development and operation of next-generation fusion devices. Fusion data shows non-stationary behavior with distribution drifts, resulted by both experimental evolution and machine wear-and-tear. ML models assume stationary distribution and fail to maintain performance when encountered with such non-stationary data streams. Online learning techniques have been leveraged in other domains, however it has been largely unexplored for fusion applications. In this paper, we present an application of online learning to continuously adapt to drifting data stream for prediction of Toroidal Field (TF) coils deflection at the DIII-D fusion facility. The results demonstrate that online learning is critical to maintain ML model performance and reduces error by 80% compared to a static model. Moreover, traditional online learning can suffer from short-term performance degradation as ground truth is not available before making the predictions. As such, we propose an uncertainty guided online ensemble method to further improve the performance. The Deep Gaussian Process Approximation (DGPA) technique is leveraged for calibrated uncertainty estimation and the uncertainty values are then used to guide a meta-algorithm that produces predictions based on an ensemble of learners trained on different horizon of historical data. The DGPA also provides uncertainty estimation along with the predictions for decision makers. The online ensemble and the proposed uncertainty guided online ensemble reduces predictions error by about 6%, and 10% respectively over standard single model based online learning.",

        "abstract": "Shapley data valuation provides a principled, axiomatic framework for assigning importance to individual datapoints, and has gained traction in dataset curation, pruning, and pricing. However, it is a combinatorial measure that requires evaluating marginal utility across all subsets of the data, making it computationally infeasible at scale. We propose a geometric alternative based on statistical leverage scores, which quantify each datapoint's structural influence in the representation space by measuring how much it extends the span of the dataset and contributes to the effective dimensionality of the training problem. We show that our scores satisfy the dummy, efficiency, and symmetry axioms of Shapley valuation and that extending them to \\emph{ridge leverage scores} yields strictly positive marginal gains that connect naturally to classical A- and D-optimal design criteria. We further show that training on a leverage-sampled subset produces a model whose parameters and predictive risk are within $O(\\varepsilon)$ of the full-data optimum, thereby providing a rigorous link between data valuation and downstream decision quality. Finally, we conduct an active learning experiment in which we empirically demonstrate that ridge-leverage sampling outperforms standard baselines without requiring access gradients or backward passes.",

        "abstract": "Using large language models (LLMs) to perform natural language processing (NLP) tasks has become increasingly pervasive in recent times. The versatile nature of LLMs makes them applicable to a wide range of such tasks. While the performance of recent LLMs is generally outstanding, several studies have shown that they can often produce incorrect results. Automatically identifying these faulty behaviors is extremely useful for improving the effectiveness of LLMs. One obstacle to this is the limited availability of labeled datasets, which necessitates an oracle to determine the correctness of LLM behaviors. Metamorphic testing (MT) is a popular testing approach that alleviates this oracle problem. At the core of MT are metamorphic relations (MRs), which define relationships between the outputs of related inputs. MT can expose faulty behaviors without the need for explicit oracles (e.g., labeled datasets). This paper presents the most comprehensive study of MT for LLMs to date. We conducted a literature review and collected 191 MRs for NLP tasks. We implemented a representative subset (36 MRs) to conduct a series of experiments with three popular LLMs, running approximately 560,000 metamorphic tests. The results shed light on the capabilities and opportunities of MT for LLMs, as well as its limitations.",

In traditional regression tasks, mean squared error (MSE) loss is a common choice, but it can be unreliable for non-Gaussian or heavy-tailed noise. To address this issue, we adopt a robust loss based on nonparametric regression, which uses a kernel-based estimate of the residual density and maximizes the estimated log-likelihood. This robust formulation coincides with the MSE loss under Gaussian errors but remains stable under more general settings. We further examine how this robust loss reshapes the optimization landscape by analyzing the upper-bound of restricted isometry property (RIP) constants for spurious local minima to disappear. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we show that this new loss excels at handling large noise and remains robust across diverse noise distributions. This work offers initial insights into enhancing the robustness of machine learning tasks through simply changing the loss, guided by an intuitive and broadly applicable analytical framework.",

To address this limitation, we propose CausalDDS, a novel framework that disentangles drug molecules into causal and spurious substructures, utilizing the causal substructure representations for predicting drug synergy. By focusing on causal sub-structures, CausalDDS effectively mitigates the impact of redundant features introduced by spurious substructures, enhancing the accuracy and interpretability of the model. In addition, CausalDDS employs a conditional intervention mechanism, where interventions are conditioned on paired molecular structures, and introduces a novel optimization objective guided by the principles of sufficiency and independence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline models, particularly in cold start and out-of-distribution settings. Besides, CausalDDS effectively identifies key substructures underlying drug synergy, providing clear insights into how drug combinations work at the molecular level. These results underscore the potential of CausalDDS as a practical tool for predicting drug synergy and facilitating drug discovery.",

This matches the best known convergence rate for CE in terms of $T$, number of iterations, while also improving the dependence on the action set size from polynomial to polylogarithmic-yielding exponential gains in high-dimensional settings. Our approach builds on recent advances in adaptive step-size techniques for no-regret algorithms in normal-form games, and extends them to the Markovian setting via a stage-wise scheme that adjusts learning rates based on real-time feedback. We frame policy updates as an instance of Optimistic Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (OFTRL), customized for value-iteration-based learning. The resulting self-play algorithm achieves, to our knowledge, the fastest known convergence rate to CCE in Markov games.",

We demonstrate that a VLM is capable of determining which mesh regions need panel components in addition to structural components, based on object functionality. Evaluation across test objects shows that users preferred the VLM-generated assignments 90.6% of the time, compared to 59.4% for rule-based and 2.5% for random assignment.

Existing tools either provide formal guarantees for limited types of systems or test the system as a monolith, but no general framework exists for compositional analysis of learning-enabled CPS using varied verification techniques over complex real-world environments. This paper introduces ScenicProver, a verification framework that aims to fill this gap. Built upon the Scenic probabilistic programming language, the framework supports: (1) compositional system description with clear component interfaces, ranging from interpretable code to black boxes; (2) assume-guarantee contracts over those components using an extension of Linear Temporal Logic containing arbitrary Scenic expressions; (3) evidence generation through testing, formal proofs via Lean 4 integration, and importing external assumptions; (4) systematic combination of generated evidence using contract operators; and (5) automatic generation of assurance cases tracking the provenance of system-level guarantees. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness through a case study on an autonomous vehicle's automatic emergency braking system with sensor fusion. By leveraging manufacturer guarantees for radar and laser sensors and focusing testing efforts on uncertain conditions, our approach enables stronger probabilistic guarantees than monolithic testing with the same computational budget.",

To address these challenges, we propose an end to end framework, the channel gated learning unit based spatiotemporal bayesian neural field (CGLUBNF). It uses Fourier features with a graph attention encoder to capture multiscale spatial dependencies and seasonal temporal dynamics. A channel gated learning unit, equipped with learnable activations and gated residual connections, adaptively filters and amplifies informative features. Bayesian inference jointly optimizes predictive distributions and parameter uncertainty, producing point estimates and calibrated prediction intervals. We conduct a systematic evaluation on two real world datasets, covering four typical missing data patterns and comparing against five state of the art baselines. CGLUBNF achieves superior prediction accuracy and sharper confidence intervals. In addition, we further validate robustness across multiple prediction horizons and analysis the contribution of extraneous variables.

This gives more room for exploration in logic optimization, while also posing a challenge for tasks involving consistency between Boolean networks. To tackle this challenge, we introduce BoolSkeleton, a novel Boolean network skeletonization method that improves the consistency and reliability of design-specific evaluations. BoolSkeleton comprises two key steps: preprocessing and reduction. In preprocessing, the Boolean network is transformed into a defined Boolean dependency graph, where nodes are assigned the functionality-related status. Next, the homogeneous and heterogeneous patterns are defined for the node-level pattern reduction step. Heterogeneous patterns are preserved to maintain critical functionality-related dependencies, while homogeneous patterns can be reduced. Parameter K of the pattern further constrains the fanin size of these patterns, enabling fine-tuned control over the granularity of graph reduction. To validate BoolSkeleton's effectiveness, we conducted four analysis/downstream tasks around the Boolean network: compression analysis, classification, critical path analysis, and timing prediction, demonstrating its robustness across diverse scenarios. Furthermore, it improves above 55% in the average accuracy compared to the original Boolean network for the timing prediction task.

Confidence estimation serves as an effective and convenient approach for evaluating these aspects. This paper proposes a confidence analysis and enhancement framework for LLMs tailored to code reasoning tasks. We conduct a comprehensive empirical study on the confidence reliability of mainstream LLMs across different tasks, and further evaluate the effectiveness of techniques such as prompt strategy optimisation and mathematical calibration (e.g., Platt Scaling) in improving confidence reliability. Our results show that DeepSeek-Reasoner achieves the best performance across various tasks, outperforming other models by up to $0.680$, $0.636$, and $13.652$ in terms of ECE, Brier Score, and Performance Score, respectively. The hybrid strategy combining the reassess prompt strategy and Platt Scaling achieves improvements of up to $0.541$, $0.628$, and $15.084$ over the original performance in the aforementioned three metrics. These results indicate that models with reasoning capabilities demonstrate superior confidence reliability, and that the hybrid strategy is the most effective in enhancing the confidence reliability of various models. Meanwhile, we elucidate the impact of different task complexities, model scales, and strategies on confidence performance, and highlight that the confidence of current LLMs in complex reasoning tasks still has considerable room for improvement. This study not only provides a research foundation and technical reference for the application of confidence in LLM-assisted software engineering, but also points the way for future optimisation and engineering deployment of confidence mechanisms.",

Current techniques for strain estimation require significant manual intervention and expertise, limiting their efficiency and making them too resource-intensive for monitoring purposes. This study introduces the first automated pipeline, autoStrain, for SLS estimation in transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) using deep learning (DL) methods for motion estimation. We present a comparative analysis of two DL approaches: TeeFlow, based on the RAFT optical flow model for dense frame-to-frame predictions, and TeeTracker, based on the CoTracker point trajectory model for sparse long-sequence predictions. As ground truth motion data from real echocardiographic sequences are hardly accessible, we took advantage of a unique simulation pipeline (SIMUS) to generate a highly realistic synthetic TEE (synTEE) dataset of 80 patients with ground truth myocardial motion to train and evaluate both models. Our evaluation shows that TeeTracker outperforms TeeFlow in accuracy, achieving a mean distance error in motion estimation of 0.65 mm on a synTEE test dataset. Clinical validation on 16 patients further demonstrated that SLS estimation with our autoStrain pipeline aligned with clinical references, achieving a mean difference (95\\% limits of agreement) of 1.09% (-8.90% to 11.09%). Incorporation of simulated ischemia in the synTEE data improved the accuracy of the models in quantifying abnormal deformation. Our findings indicate that integrating AI-driven motion estimation with TEE can significantly enhance the precision and efficiency of cardiac function assessment in clinical settings.",

Meeting stringent URLLC requirements is challenging, especially for two-hop cooperative communication. In this paper, we develop an adaptive transmission design for a two-hop relaying communication system. Each hop transmission adaptively configures its transmission parameters separately, including numerology, mini-slot size, and modulation and coding scheme, for reliable packet transmission within a strict latency constraint. We formulate the hop-specific transceiver configuration as a Markov decision process (MDP) and propose a dual-agent reinforcement learning-based cooperative latency-aware transmission (DRL-CoLA) algorithm to learn latency-aware transmission policies in a distributed manner. Simulation results verify that the proposed algorithm achieves the near-optimal reliability while satisfying strict latency requirements.",

        "abstract": "One of the main challenges in managing traffic at multilane intersections is ensuring smooth coordination between human-driven vehicles (HDVs) and connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs). This paper presents a novel traffic signal control framework that combines Graph Attention Networks (GAT) with Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) reinforcement learning to address this challenge. GATs are used to model the dynamic graph- structured nature of traffic flow to capture spatial and temporal dependencies between lanes and signal phases. The proposed SAC is a robust off-policy reinforcement learning algorithm that enables adaptive signal control through entropy-optimized decision making. This design allows the system to coordinate the signal timing and vehicle movement simultaneously with objectives focused on minimizing travel time, enhancing performance, ensuring safety, and improving fairness between HDVs and CAVs. The model is evaluated using a SUMO-based simulation of a four-way intersection and incorporating different traffic densities and CAV penetration rates. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the GAT-SAC approach by achieving a 24.1% reduction in average delay and up to 29.2% fewer traffic violations compared to traditional methods. Additionally, the fairness ratio between HDVs and CAVs improved to 1.59, indicating more equitable treatment across vehicle types. These findings suggest that the GAT-SAC framework holds significant promise for real-world deployment in mixed-autonomy traffic systems.",

        "abstract": "Agentic LLM applications interleave LLM generation requests with tool calls. These tool calls break the continuity of the workflow by creating pauses between LLM requests, bringing many challenges for the serving system, especially under multi-turn scenarios. Each pause potentially causes KV cache eviction and extra waiting time before entering the continuous batch for the following LLM request. Since these pauses happen for each call, this problem becomes increasingly severe as turn number grow for agentic programs. Previous works either fail to incorporate information from the tool call, evicting KV cache that leads to repetitive prefill or loading, or ignore the continuity of a multi-turn program, creating waiting time between turns that increases per-request latency. We present Continuum, a serving system to optimize job completion time for multi-turn agent workloads by combining tool-aware KV cache timeout with program-level scheduling. By predicting tool call durations in agentic workflows, Continuum selectively pins the KV cache in GPU memory with a time-to-live value based on total turn number. When combined with program-level first-come-first-serve, Continuum prevents scheduling bubbles, preserves multi-turn continuity, and optimizes for throughput for complex agentic workflows. By modeling the variability of tool call and agent program continuity, Continuum outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Our evaluation on real-world agentic workloads (SWE-Bench and BFCL) with Llama-3.1 8B/70B models shows that Continuum significantly improves the average job completion times, and remains performant across different hardware setups and DRAM offloading schemes.

        "abstract": "Learning generalizable policies for robotic manipulation increasingly relies on large-scale models that map language instructions to actions (L2A). However, this one-way paradigm often produces policies that execute tasks without deeper contextual understanding, limiting their ability to generalize or explain their behavior. We argue that the complementary skill of mapping actions back to language (A2L) is essential for developing more holistic grounding. An agent capable of both acting and explaining its actions can form richer internal representations and unlock new paradigms for self-supervised learning. We introduce LACY (Language-Action Cycle), a unified framework that learns such bidirectional mappings within a single vision-language model. LACY is jointly trained on three synergistic tasks: generating parameterized actions from language (L2A), explaining observed actions in language (A2L), and verifying semantic consistency between two language descriptions (L2C). This enables a self-improving cycle that autonomously generates and filters new training data through an active augmentation strategy targeting low-confidence cases, thereby improving the model without additional human labels. Experiments on pick-and-place tasks in both simulation and the real world show that LACY improves task success rates by 56.46% on average and yields more robust language-action grounding for robotic manipulation.

This paper introduces the Structurally Adaptive Predictive Inference Network (SAPIN), a novel computational model inspired by the principles of active inference and the morphological plasticity observed in biological neural cultures. SAPIN operates on a 2D grid where processing units, or cells, learn by minimizing local prediction errors. The model features two primary, concurrent learning mechanisms: a local, Hebbian-like synaptic plasticity rule based on the temporal difference between a cell's actual activation and its learned expectation, and a structural plasticity mechanism where cells physically migrate across the grid to optimize their information-receptive fields. This dual approach allows the network to learn both how to process information (synaptic weights) and also where to position its computational resources (network topology). We validated the SAPIN model on the classic Cart Pole reinforcement learning benchmark. Our results demonstrate that the architecture can successfully solve the CartPole task, achieving robust performance. The network's intrinsic drive to minimize prediction error and maintain homeostasis was sufficient to discover a stable balancing policy. We also found that while continual learning led to instability, locking the network's parameters after achieving success resulted in a stable policy. When evaluated for 100 episodes post-locking (repeated over 100 successful agents), the locked networks maintained an average 82% success rate.",

In order to understand the conditions under which medical chatbots fail to perform as expected, we develop an infrastructure that 1) automatically generates queries to probe LLMs and 2) evaluates answers to these queries using multiple LLM-as-a-judge setups and prompts. For 1), our prompt creation pipeline samples the space of patient demographics, histories, disorders, and writing styles to create realistic questions that we subsequently use to prompt LLMs. In 2), our evaluation pipeline provides hallucination and omission detection using LLM-as-a-judge as well as agentic workflows, in addition to LLM-as-a-judge treatment category detectors. As a baseline study, we perform two case studies on inter-LLM agreement and the impact of varying the answering and evaluation LLMs. We find that LLM annotators exhibit low agreement scores (average Cohen's Kappa $\\kappa=0.118$), and only specific (answering, evaluation) LLM pairs yield statistically significant differences across writing styles, genders, and races. We recommend that studies using LLM evaluation use multiple LLMs as evaluators in order to avoid arriving at statistically significant but non-generalizable results, particularly in the absence of ground-truth data. We also suggest publishing inter-LLM agreement metrics for transparency. Our code and dataset are available here: this https URL.",

Classical federated learning approaches mitigate privacy concerns by enabling decentralized training, but they often struggle with highly non-linear decision boundaries and imbalanced anomaly distributions. To address this gap, we propose a Federated Quantum Kernel Learning (FQKL) framework that integrates quantum feature maps with federated aggregation to enable distributed, privacy-preserving anomaly detection across heterogeneous IoT networks. In our design, quantum edge nodes locally compute compressed kernel statistics using parameterized quantum circuits and share only these summaries with a central server, which constructs a global Gram matrix and trains a decision function (e.g., Fed-QSVM). Experimental results on synthetic IIoT benchmarks demonstrate that FQKL achieves superior generalization in capturing complex temporal correlations compared to classical federated baselines, while significantly reducing communication overhead. This work highlights the promise of quantum kernels in federated settings, advancing the path toward scalable, robust, and quantum-enhanced intelligence for next-generation IoT infrastructures.",

Experiments show emergent task-aware, multi-step coordination among agents, e.g., pressing a button to unlock a door, holding the door, and short-circuiting tasks.",

Through comprehensive evaluation across 5 state-of-the-art open source models and 3 challenging reasoning benchmarks, we find that sequential scaling where chains explicitly build upon previous attempts consistently outperforms the dominant parallel self-consistency paradigm in 95.6% of configurations with gains in accuracy upto 46.7%. Further, we introduce inverse-entropy weighted voting, a novel training-free method to further boost the accuracy of sequential scaling. By weighing answers in proportion to the inverse entropy of their reasoning chains, we increase our success rate over parallel majority and establish it as the optimal test-time scaling strategy. Our findings fundamentally challenge the parallel reasoning orthodoxy that has dominated test-time scaling since Wang et al.'s self-consistency decoding (Wang et al., 2022), positioning sequential refinement as the robust default for modern LLM reasoning and necessitating a paradigm shift in how we approach inference-time optimization.",

        "abstract": "Biological networks are pivotal in deciphering the complexity and functionality of biological systems. Causal inference, which focuses on determining the directionality and strength of interactions between variables rather than merely relying on correlations, is considered a logical approach for inferring biological networks. Existing methods for causal structure inference typically assume that causal relationships between variables can be represented by directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). However, this assumption is at odds with the reality of widespread feedback loops in biological systems, making these methods unsuitable for direct use in biological network inference. In this study, we propose a new framework named SCALD (Structural CAusal model for Loop Diagram), which employs a nonlinear structure equation model and a stable feedback loop conditional constraint through continuous optimization to infer causal regulatory relationships under feedback loops. We observe that SCALD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in inferring both transcriptional regulatory networks and signaling transduction networks. SCALD has irreplaceable advantages in identifying feedback regulation. Through transcription factor (TF) perturbation data analysis, we further validate the accuracy and sensitivity of SCALD. Additionally, SCALD facilitates the discovery of previously unknown regulatory relationships, which we have subsequently confirmed through ChIP-seq data analysis. Furthermore, by utilizing SCALD, we infer the key driver genes that facilitate the transformation from colon inflammation to cancer by examining the dynamic changes within regulatory networks during the process.",

Current studies have proposed Large Language Model (LLM)-based embedders, which learn representation for embedding and generation for query augmentation in a multi-task manner by leveraging the generative capabilities of LLM. During inference, these jointly trained embedders have conducted query augmentation followed by embedding, showing effective results. However, augmenting every query leads to substantial embedding latency and query augmentation can be detrimental to performance for some queries. Also, previous methods have not been explored in multimodal environments. To tackle these problems, we propose M-Solomon, a universal multimodal embedder that can adaptively determine when to augment queries. Our approach first divides the queries of the training datasets into two groups at the dataset level. One includes queries that require augmentation and the other includes queries that do not. Then, we introduces a synthesis process that generates appropriate augmentations for queries that require them by leveraging a powerful Multimodal LLM (MLLM). Next, we present adaptive query augmentation. Through this step, M-Solomon can conduct query augmentation only when necessary by learning to generate synthetic augmentations with the prefix /augment for queries that demand them and to generate the simple string /embed for others. Experimental results showed that M-Solomon not only surpassed the baseline without augmentation by a large margin but also outperformed the baseline that always used augmentation, providing much faster embedding latency.",

        "abstract": "Early detection of heart arrhythmia can prevent severe future complications in cardiac patients. While manual diagnosis still remains the clinical standard, it relies heavily on visual interpretation and is inherently subjective. In recent years, deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool to automate arrhythmia detection, offering improved accuracy, consistency, and efficiency. Several variants of convolutional and recurrent neural network architectures have been widely explored to capture spatial and temporal patterns in physiological signals. However, despite these advancements, current models often struggle to generalize well in real-world scenarios, especially when dealing with small or noisy datasets, which are common challenges in biomedical applications. In this paper, a novel CNN-H-Infinity-LSTM architecture is proposed to identify arrhythmic heart signals from heart sound recordings. This architecture introduces trainable parameters inspired by the H-Infinity filter from control theory, enhancing robustness and generalization. Extensive experimentation on the PhysioNet CinC Challenge 2016 dataset, a public benchmark of heart audio recordings, demonstrates that the proposed model achieves stable convergence and outperforms existing benchmarks, with a test accuracy of 99.42% and an F1 score of 98.85%.",

However, existing approaches largely adopt linear, waterfall-style pipelines, which oversimplify the iterative nature of real-world development and struggle with complex, large-scale projects. To address these limitations, we propose EvoDev, an iterative software development framework inspired by feature-driven development. EvoDev decomposes user requirements into a set of user-valued features and constructs a Feature Map, a directed acyclic graph that explicitly models dependencies between features. Each node in the feature map maintains multi-level information, including business logic, design, and code, which is propagated along dependencies to provide context for subsequent development iterations. We evaluate EvoDev on challenging Android development tasks and show that it outperforms the best-performing baseline, Claude Code, by a substantial margin of 56.8%, while improving single-agent performance by 16.0%-76.6% across different base LLMs, highlighting the importance of dependency modeling, context propagation, and workflow-aware agent design for complex software projects.

Most notably, Felis Catus (domestic cats) have vertically elongated pupils linked to ambush predation; yet, how such specializations manifest in downstream visual representations remains incompletely understood. We present a unified, frozen-encoder benchmark that quantifies feline-human cross-species representational alignment in the wild, across convolutional networks, supervised Vision Transformers, windowed transformers, and self-supervised ViTs (DINO), using layer-wise Centered Kernel Alignment (linear and RBF) and Representational Similarity Analysis, with additional distributional and stability tests reported in the paper. Across models, DINO ViT-B/16 attains the most substantial alignment (mean CKA-RBF $\\approx0.814$, mean CKA-linear $\\approx0.745$, mean RSA $\\approx0.698$), peaking at early blocks, indicating that token-level self-supervision induces early-stage features that bridge species-specific statistics. Supervised ViTs are competitive on CKA yet show weaker geometric correspondence than DINO (e.g., ViT-B/16 RSA $\\approx0.53$ at block8; ViT-L/16 $\\approx0.47$ at block14), revealing depth-dependent divergences between similarity and representational geometry. CNNs remain strong baselines but below plain ViTs on alignment, and windowed transformers underperform plain ViTs, implicating architectural inductive biases in cross-species alignment. Results indicate that self-supervision coupled with ViT inductive biases yields representational geometries that more closely align feline and human visual systems than widely used CNNs and windowed Transformers, providing testable neuroscientific hypotheses about where and how cross-species visual computations converge.

Many seminal models, such as TransE, operate in an unbounded Euclidean space, which presents inherent limitations in modeling complex relations and can lead to inefficient training. In this paper, we propose Spherical Knowledge Graph Embedding (SKGE), a model that challenges this paradigm by constraining entity representations to a compact manifold: a hypersphere. SKGE employs a learnable, non-linear Spherization Layer to map entities onto the sphere and interprets relations as a hybrid translate-then-project transformation. Through extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, FB15k-237, CoDEx-S, and CoDEx-M, we demonstrate that SKGE consistently and significantly outperforms its strong Euclidean counterpart, TransE, particularly on large-scale benchmarks such as FB15k-237 and CoDEx-M, demonstrating the efficacy of the spherical geometric prior. We provide an in-depth analysis to reveal the sources of this advantage, showing that this geometric constraint acts as a powerful regularizer, leading to comprehensive performance gains across all relation types. More fundamentally, we prove that the spherical geometry creates an \"inherently hard negative sampling\" environment, naturally eliminating trivial negatives and forcing the model to learn more robust and semantically coherent representations. Our findings compellingly demonstrate that the choice of manifold is not merely an implementation detail but a fundamental design principle, advocating for geometric priors as a cornerstone for designing the next generation of powerful and stable KGE models.",

While prior studies have used monetary policy texts to predict rate changes, most rely on static classification models that overlook the deliberative nature of policymaking. This study proposes a novel framework that structurally imitates the FOMC's collective decision-making process by modeling multiple large language models(LLMs) as interacting agents. Each agent begins with a distinct initial belief and produces a prediction based on both qualitative policy texts and quantitative macroeconomic indicators. Through iterative rounds, agents revise their predictions by observing the outputs of others, simulating deliberation and consensus formation. To enhance interpretability, we introduce a latent variable representing each agent's underlying belief(e.g., hawkish or dovish), and we theoretically demonstrate how this belief mediates the perception of input information and interaction dynamics. Empirical results show that this debate-based approach significantly outperforms standard LLMs-based baselines in prediction accuracy. Furthermore, the explicit modeling of beliefs provides insights into how individual perspectives and social influence shape collective policy forecasts.",

In this paper, we propose a wireless video semantic communication framework with decoupled diffusion multi-frame compensation (DDMFC), abbreviated as WVSC-D, which integrates the idea of semantic communication into wireless video transmission scenarios. WVSC-D first encodes original video frames as semantic frames and then conducts video coding based on such compact representations, enabling the video coding in semantic level rather than pixel level. Moreover, to further reduce the communication overhead, a reference semantic frame is introduced to substitute motion vectors of each frame in common video coding methods. At the receiver, DDMFC is proposed to generate compensated current semantic frame by a two-stage conditional diffusion process. With both the reference frame transmission and DDMFC frame compensation, the bandwidth efficiency improves with satisfying video transmission performance. Experimental results verify the performance gain of WVSC-D over other DL-based methods e.g. DVSC about 1.8 dB in terms of PSNR.",

We propose BRAINS (Biomedical Retrieval-Augmented Intelligence for Neurodegeneration Screening) to address this challenge. This novel system harnesses the powerful reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) for Alzheimer's detection and monitoring. BRAINS features a dual-module architecture: a cognitive diagnostic module and a case-retrieval module. The Diagnostic Module utilizes LLMs fine-tuned on cognitive and neuroimaging datasets -- including MMSE, CDR scores, and brain volume metrics -- to perform structured assessments of Alzheimer's risk. Meanwhile, the Case Retrieval Module encodes patient profiles into latent representations and retrieves similar cases from a curated knowledge base. These auxiliary cases are fused with the input profile via a Case Fusion Layer to enhance contextual understanding. The combined representation is then processed with clinical prompts for inference. Evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate BRAINS effectiveness in classifying disease severity and identifying early signs of cognitive decline. This system not only shows strong potential as an assistive tool for scalable, explainable, and early-stage Alzheimer's disease detection, but also offers hope for future applications in the field.",

In particular, we reformulate the CLRPs as a markov decision process tailored to various decisions, a general modeling framework that can be adapted to other DRL-based methods. To better handle the interdependency across location and routing decisions, we also introduce a novel heterogeneous querying attention mechanism designed to adapt dynamically to various decision-making stages.

This brittleness stems, in part, from learning statistical associations rather than causal mechanisms. Causal graph neural networks address this triple crisis of distribution shift, discrimination, and inscrutability by combining graph-based representations of biomedical data with causal inference principles to learn invariant mechanisms rather than spurious correlations. This Review examines methodological foundations spanning structural causal models, disentangled causal representation learning, and techniques for interventional prediction and counterfactual reasoning on graphs. We analyse applications demonstrating clinical value across psychiatric diagnosis through brain network analysis, cancer subtyping via multi-omics causal integration, continuous physiological monitoring with mechanistic interpretation, and drug recommendation correcting prescription bias. These advances establish foundations for patient-specific Causal Digital Twins, enabling in silico clinical experimentation, with integration of large language models for hypothesis generation and causal graph neural networks for mechanistic validation. Substantial barriers remain, including computational requirements precluding real-time deployment, validation challenges demanding multi-modal evidence triangulation beyond cross-validation, and risks of causal-washing where methods employ causal terminology without rigorous evidentiary support. We propose tiered frameworks distinguishing causally-inspired architectures from causally-validated discoveries and identify critical research priorities making causal rather than purely associational claims.",

By disentangling and leveraging features from early visual cortex, ventral, and dorsal streams, VCFlow captures diverse and complementary cognitive information essential for visual reconstruction. Furthermore, we introduce a feature-level contrastive learning strategy to enhance the extraction of subject-invariant semantic representations, thereby enhancing subject-agnostic applicability to previously unseen subjects. Unlike conventional pipelines that need more than 12 hours of per-subject data and heavy computation, VCFlow sacrifices only 7\\% accuracy on average yet generates each reconstructed video in 10 seconds without any retraining, offering a fast and clinically scalable solution.

        "abstract": "Offline reinforcement learning (RL) suffers from extrapolation errors induced by out-of-distribution (OOD) actions. To address this, offline RL algorithms typically impose constraints on action selection, which can be systematically categorized into density, support, and sample constraints. However, we show that each category has inherent limitations: density and sample constraints tend to be overly conservative in many scenarios, while the support constraint, though least restrictive, faces challenges in accurately modeling the behavior policy. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new neighborhood constraint that restricts action selection in the Bellman target to the union of neighborhoods of dataset actions. Theoretically, the constraint not only bounds extrapolation errors and distribution shift under certain conditions, but also approximates the support constraint without requiring behavior policy modeling. Moreover, it retains substantial flexibility and enables pointwise conservatism by adapting the neighborhood radius for each data point. In practice, we employ data quality as the adaptation criterion and design an adaptive neighborhood constraint. Building on an efficient bilevel optimization framework, we develop a simple yet effective algorithm, Adaptive Neighborhood-constrained Q learning (ANQ), to perform Q learning with target actions satisfying this constraint. Empirically, ANQ achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard offline RL benchmarks and exhibits strong robustness in scenarios with noisy or limited data.",

This omission poses a lost opportunity while limiting predictive performance. We propose Next Token Knowledge Tracing (NTKT), a novel approach that reframes KT as a next-token prediction task using pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs). NTKT represents both student histories and question content as sequences of text, allowing LLMs to learn patterns in both behaviour and language. Our series of experiments significantly improves performance over state-of-the-art neural KT models and generalises much better to cold-start questions and users.

We formalize quantum-specific trust metrics grounded in quantum information theory, including a variance-based decomposition of predictive uncertainty, trace-distance-bounded robustness, and differential privacy for hybrid learning channels. To demonstrate feasibility on current NISQ devices, we validate a unified trust assessment pipeline on parameterized quantum classifiers, uncovering correlations between uncertainty and prediction risk, an asymmetry in attack vulnerability between classical and quantum state perturbations, and privacy-utility trade-offs driven by shot noise and quantum channel noise.

We test various RL algorithms and find that Soft Actor Critic (SAC) exhibits superior performance in the GasRL environment: multiple objectives of storage operators - including profitability, robust market clearing and price stabilisation - are successfully achieved. Moreover, the equilibrium price dynamics induced by SAC-derived optimal policies have characteristics, such as volatility and seasonality, that closely match those of real-world prices. Remarkably, this adherence to the historical distribution of prices is obtained without explicitly calibrating the model to price data. We show how the simulator can be used to assess the effects of EU-mandated minimum storage thresholds. We find that such thresholds have a positive effect on market resilience against unanticipated shifts in the distribution of supply shocks. For example, with unusually large shocks, market disruptions are averted more often if a threshold is in place.",

However, their practical deployment in collaborative scenarios confronts fundamental challenges: privacy vulnerabilities, communication overhead, and computational bottlenecks. To address these, we propose Federated Attention (FedAttn), which integrates the federated paradigm into the self-attention mechanism, creating a new distributed LLM inference framework that simultaneously achieves privacy protection, communication efficiency, and computational efficiency. FedAttn enables participants to perform local self-attention over their own token representations while periodically exchanging and aggregating Key-Value (KV) matrices across multiple Transformer blocks, collaboratively generating LLM responses without exposing private prompts. Further, we identify a structural duality between contextual representation refinement in FedAttn and parameter optimization in FL across private data, local computation, and global aggregation. This key insight provides a principled foundation for systematically porting federated optimization techniques to collaborative LLM inference. Building on this framework, we theoretically analyze how local self-attention computation within participants and heterogeneous token relevance among participants shape error propagation dynamics across Transformer blocks. Moreover, we characterize the fundamental trade-off between response quality and communication/computation efficiency, which is governed by the synchronization interval and the number of participants. Experimental results validate our theoretical analysis, and reveal significant optimization opportunities through sparse attention and adaptive KV aggregation, highlighting FedAttn's potential to deliver scalability and efficiency in real-world edge deployments.",

However, transformers suffer from quadratic time and memory complexity in the attention module (MHA) and require caching key-value states during inference, which severely limits throughput and scalability. High inference throughput is critical for agentic tasks, long-context reasoning, efficient deployment under high request loads, and more efficient test-time compute scaling. State Space Models (SSMs) such as Mamba offer a promising alternative with linear inference complexity and a constant memory footprint via recurrent computation with fixed-size hidden states. In this technical report we introduce the Apriel-H1 family of hybrid LLMs that combine transformer attention and SSM sequence mixers for efficient reasoning at 15B model size. These models are obtained through incremental distillation from a pretrained reasoning transformer, Apriel-Nemotron-15B-Thinker, progressively replacing less critical attention layers with linear Mamba blocks. We release multiple post-distillation variants of Apriel-H1-15B-Thinker with different SSM-to-MHA ratios and analyse how reasoning performance degrades as more Mamba layers replace MHA. Additionally, we release a 30/50 hybrid variant of Apriel-H1, further fine-tuned on a supervised dataset of reasoning traces, achieving over 2x higher inference throughput when deployed in the production-ready vLLM environment, with minimal degradation in reasoning performance. This shows that distilled hybrid SSM-Transformer architectures can deliver substantial efficiency gains over the pretrained transformer equivalent without substantially compromising the reasoning quality.",

The theoretical motivation for our use of sketching as a regularizer is presented via a simple Johnson-Lindenstrauss-informed result. While our methods may be of wider interest in the field of continual learning, we specifically target in situ neural compression using implicit neural representation-based hypernetworks. We evaluate our method on a variety of complex simulation data in two and three dimensions, over long time horizons, and across unstructured grids and non-Cartesian geometries. On these tasks, we show strong reconstruction performance at high compression rates. Most importantly, we demonstrate that sketching enables the presented in situ scheme to approximately match the performance of the equivalent offline method.",

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly prevalent across diverse applications. However, their enormous size limits storage and processing capabilities to a few well-resourced stakeholders. As a result, most applications rely on pre-trained LLMs, fine-tuned for specific tasks. However, even storing the fine-tuned versions of these models remains a significant challenge due to the wide range of tasks they address. Recently, studies show that fine-tuning these models primarily affects a small fraction of parameters, highlighting the need for more efficient storage of fine-tuned models. This paper focuses on efficient storage of parameter updates in pre-trained models after fine-tuning. To address this challenge, we leverage the observation that fine-tuning updates are both low-rank and sparse, which can be utilized for storage efficiency. However, using only low-rank approximation or sparsification may discard critical singular components that enhance model expressivity. We first observe that given the same memory budget, sparsified low-rank approximations with larger ranks outperform standard low-rank approximations with smaller ranks. Building on this, we propose our method, optimal singular damage, that selectively sparsifies low-rank approximated updates by leveraging the interleaved importance of singular vectors, ensuring that the most impactful components are retained. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that our proposed methods lead to significant storage efficiency and superior accuracy within the same memory budget compared to employing the low-rank approximation or sparsification individually.",

        "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) underpin many modern computer vision systems. With applications ranging from common to critical areas, a need to explain and understand the model and its decisions (XAI) emerged. Prior works suggest that in the top layers of CNNs, the individual channels can be attributed to classifying human-understandable concepts. Concept relevance propagation (CRP) methods can backtrack predictions to these channels and find images that most activate these channels. However, current CRP workflows are largely manual: experts must inspect activation images to name the discovered concepts and must synthesize verbose explanations from relevance maps, limiting the accessibility of the explanations and their scalability. To address these issues, we introduce Large Language model EXplaIns COncept Relevance Propagation (LLEXICORP), a modular pipeline that couples CRP with a multimodal large language model. Our approach automatically assigns descriptive names to concept prototypes and generates natural-language explanations that translate quantitative relevance distributions into intuitive narratives. To ensure faithfulness, we craft prompts that teach the language model the semantics of CRP through examples and enforce a separation between naming and explanation tasks. The resulting text can be tailored to different audiences, offering low-level technical descriptions for experts and high-level summaries for non-technical stakeholders. We qualitatively evaluate our method on various images from ImageNet on a VGG16 model. Our findings suggest that integrating concept-based attribution methods with large language models can significantly lower the barrier to interpreting deep neural networks, paving the way for more transparent AI systems.",

To test this, we use a weighted regression model to isolate the language effect from socioeconomic and demographic factors, finding that LRLCs have a share of AI users that is approximately 20% lower relative to their baseline.

        "abstract": "The chemical space of drug-like molecules is vast, motivating the development of generative models that must learn broad chemical distributions, enable conditional generation by capturing structure-property representations, and provide fast molecular generation. Meeting the objectives depends on modeling choices, including the probabilistic modeling approach, the conditional generative formulation, the architecture, and the molecular input representation. To address the challenges, we present STAR-VAE (Selfies-encoded, Transformer-based, AutoRegressive Variational Auto Encoder), a scalable latent-variable framework with a Transformer encoder and an autoregressive Transformer decoder. It is trained on 79 million drug-like molecules from PubChem, using SELFIES to guarantee syntactic validity. The latent-variable formulation enables conditional generation: a property predictor supplies a conditioning signal that is applied consistently to the latent prior, the inference network, and the decoder. Our contributions are: (i) a Transformer-based latent-variable encoder-decoder model trained on SELFIES representations; (ii) a principled conditional latent-variable formulation for property-guided generation; and (iii) efficient finetuning with low-rank adapters (LoRA) in both encoder and decoder, enabling fast adaptation with limited property and activity data. On the GuacaMol and MOSES benchmarks, our approach matches or exceeds baselines, and latent-space analyses reveal smooth, semantically structured representations that support both unconditional exploration and property-aware generation. On the Tartarus benchmarks, the conditional model shifts docking-score distributions toward stronger predicted binding. These results suggest that a modernized, scale-appropriate VAE remains competitive for molecular generation when paired with principled conditioning and parameter-efficient finetuning.",

In auditing, proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits play a critical role by demonstrating to the stakeholders that the reported vulnerabilities are genuine, reproducible, and actionable. However, manually creating PoCs is time-consuming, error-prone, and often constrained by tight audit schedules. We introduce POCO, an agentic framework that automatically generates executable PoC exploits from natural-language vulnerability descriptions written by auditors. POCO autonomously generates PoC exploits in an agentic manner by interacting with a set of code-execution tools in a Reason-Act-Observe loop. It produces fully executable exploits compatible with the Foundry testing framework, ready for integration into audit reports and other security tools. We evaluate POCO on a dataset of 23 real-world vulnerability reports. POCO consistently outperforms the prompting and workflow baselines, generating well-formed and logically correct PoCs. Our results demonstrate that agentic frameworks can significantly reduce the effort required for high-quality PoCs in smart contract audits.

        "abstract": "Typical search agents concatenate the entire interaction history into the LLM context, preserving information integrity but producing long, noisy contexts, resulting in high computation and memory costs. In contrast, using only the current turn avoids this overhead but discards essential information. This trade-off limits the scalability of search agents. To address this challenge, we propose MemSearcher, an agent workflow that iteratively maintains a compact memory and combines the current turn with it. At each turn, MemSearcher fuses the user's question with the memory to generate reasoning traces, perform search actions, and update memory to retain only information essential for solving the task. This design stabilizes context length across multi-turn interactions, improving efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. To optimize this workflow, we introduce multi-context GRPO, an end-to-end RL framework that jointly optimize reasoning, search strategies, and memory management of MemSearcher Agents. Specifically, multi-context GRPO samples groups of trajectories under different contexts and propagates trajectory-level advantages across all conversations within them. Trained on the same dataset as Search-R1, MemSearcher achieves significant improvements over strong baselines on seven public benchmarks: +11% on Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct and +12% on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct relative average gains. Notably, the 3B-based MemSearcher even outperforms 7B-based baselines, demonstrating that striking a balance between information integrity and efficiency yields both higher accuracy and lower computational overhead.

We introduce Oolong, a benchmark of long-context reasoning tasks that require analyzing individual chunks of text on an atomic level, and then aggregating these analyses to answer distributional questions. Oolong is separated into two task sets: Oolong-synth, a set of naturalistic synthetic tasks, where we can easily ablate components of the reasoning problem; and Oolong-real, a downstream setting which requires reasoning over real-world conversational data. Oolong requires models to reason over large quantities of examples, to perform both classification and counting in-context, and to reason over temporal and user relations. Even frontier models struggle on Oolong, with GPT-5, Claude-Sonnet-4, and Gemini-2.5-Pro all achieving less than 50% accuracy on both splits at 128K. We release the data and evaluation harness for Oolong to enable further development of models that can reason over large quantities of text.",
