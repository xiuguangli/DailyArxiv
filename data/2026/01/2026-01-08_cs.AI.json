        "abstract": "The game of Go has long served as a benchmark for artificial intelligence, demanding sophisticated strategic reasoning and long-term planning. Previous approaches such as AlphaGo and its successors, have predominantly relied on model-based Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). In this work, we present QZero, a novel model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that forgoes search during training and learns a Nash equilibrium policy through self-play and off-policy experience replay. Built upon entropy-regularized Q-learning, QZero utilizes a single Q-value network to unify policy evaluation and improvement. Starting tabula rasa without human data and trained for 5 months with modest compute resources (7 GPUs), QZero achieved a performance level comparable to that of AlphaGo. This demonstrates, for the first time, the efficiency of using model-free reinforcement learning to master the game of Go, as well as the feasibility of off-policy reinforcement learning in solving large-scale and complex environments.",

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to evolve solutions to problems in many domains, in a process inspired by biological evolution. However, unlike biological evolution, most LLM-evolution frameworks are formulated as static optimization problems, overlooking the open-ended adversarial dynamics that characterize real-world evolutionary processes. Here, we study Digital Red Queen (DRQ), a simple self-play algorithm that embraces these so-called \"Red Queen\" dynamics via continual adaptation to a changing objective. DRQ uses an LLM to evolve assembly-like programs, called warriors, which compete against each other for control of a virtual machine in the game of Core War, a Turing-complete environment studied in artificial life and connected to cybersecurity. In each round of DRQ, the model evolves a new warrior to defeat all previous ones, producing a sequence of adapted warriors. Over many rounds, we observe that warriors become increasingly general (relative to a set of held-out human warriors). Interestingly, warriors also become less behaviorally diverse across independent runs, indicating a convergence pressure toward a general-purpose behavioral strategy, much like convergent evolution in nature. This result highlights a potential value of shifting from static objectives to dynamic Red Queen objectives. Our work positions Core War as a rich, controllable sandbox for studying adversarial adaptation in artificial systems and for evaluating LLM-based evolution methods. More broadly, the simplicity and effectiveness of DRQ suggest that similarly minimal self-play approaches could prove useful in other more practical multi-agent adversarial domains, like real-world cybersecurity or combating drug resistance.",

To address this, we develop and validate CPGPrompt, an auto-prompting system that converts narrative clinical guidelines into large language models (LLMs). Our framework translates CPGs into structured decision trees and utilizes an LLM to dynamically navigate them for patient case evaluation. Synthetic vignettes were generated across three domains (headache, lower back pain, and prostate cancer) and distributed into four categories to test different decision scenarios. System performance was assessed on both binary specialty-referral decisions and fine-grained pathway-classification tasks. The binary specialty referral classification achieved consistently strong performance across all domains (F1: 0.85-1.00), with high recall (1.00 $\\pm$ 0.00). In contrast, multi-class pathway assignment showed reduced performance, with domain-specific variations: headache (F1: 0.47), lower back pain (F1: 0.72), and prostate cancer (F1: 0.77). Domain-specific performance differences reflected the structure of each guideline. The headache guideline highlighted challenges with negation handling. The lower back pain guideline required temporal reasoning. In contrast, prostate cancer pathways benefited from quantifiable laboratory tests, resulting in more reliable decision-making.",

        "abstract": "Large foundation models (LFMs) transform healthcare AI in prevention, diagnostics, and treatment. However, whether LFMs can provide truly personalized treatment recommendations remains an open question. Recent research has revealed multiple challenges for personalization, including the fundamental generalizability paradox: models achieving high accuracy in one clinical study perform at chance level in others, demonstrating that personalization and external validity exist in tension. This exemplifies broader contradictions in AI-driven healthcare: the privacy-performance paradox, scale-specificity paradox, and the automation-empathy paradox. As another challenge, the degree of causal understanding required for personalized recommendations, as opposed to mere predictive capacities of LFMs, remains an open question. N-of-1 trials -- crossover self-experiments and the gold standard for individual causal inference in personalized medicine -- resolve these tensions by providing within-person causal evidence while preserving privacy through local experimentation. Despite their impressive capabilities, this paper argues that LFMs cannot replace N-of-1 trials. We argue that LFMs and N-of-1 trials are complementary: LFMs excel at rapid hypothesis generation from population patterns using multimodal data, while N-of-1 trials excel at causal validation for a given individual. We propose a hybrid framework that combines the strengths of both to enable personalization and navigate the identified paradoxes: LFMs generate ranked intervention candidates with uncertainty estimates, which trigger subsequent N-of-1 trials. Clarifying the boundary between prediction and causation and explicitly addressing the paradoxical tensions are essential for responsible AI integration in personalized medicine.",

In practical situations on inference tasks, the model's parameters have uncertainty because they are often learned from data, and thus we want to compute the degree of uncertainty in the inference outcome. One possible approach is to regard the inference outcome as a random variable by introducing distributions for the parameters and evaluate the variance of the outcome. Unfortunately, the tractability of computing such a variance is hardly known. Motivated by this, we consider the problem of computing the variance of WMC and investigate this problem's tractability. First, we derive a polynomial time algorithm to evaluate the WMC variance when the input is given as a structured d-DNNF. Second, we prove the hardness of this problem for structured DNNFs, d-DNNFs, and FBDDs, which is intriguing because the latter two allow polynomial time WMC algorithms. Finally, we show an application that measures the uncertainty in the inference of Bayesian networks. We empirically show that our algorithm can evaluate the variance of the marginal probability on real-world Bayesian networks and analyze the impact of the variances of parameters on the variance of the marginal.",

        "abstract": "Training reliable tool-augmented agents remains a significant challenge, largely due to the difficulty of credit assignment in multi-step reasoning. While process-level reward models offer a promising direction, existing LLM-based judges often produce noisy and inconsistent signals because they lack fine-grained, task-specific rubrics to distinguish high-level planning from low-level execution. In this work, we introduce SCRIBE (Skill-Conditioned Reward with Intermediate Behavioral Evaluation), a reinforcement learning framework that intervenes at a novel mid-level abstraction. SCRIBE grounds reward modeling in a curated library of skill prototypes, transforming open-ended LLM evaluation into a constrained verification problem. By routing each subgoal to a corresponding prototype, the reward model is equipped with precise, structured rubrics that substantially reduce reward variance. Experimental results show that SCRIBE achieves state-of-the-art performance across a range of reasoning and tool-use benchmarks. In particular, it improves the AIME25 accuracy of a Qwen3-4B model from 43.3% to 63.3%, and significantly increases success rates in complex multi-turn tool interactions. Further analysis of training dynamics reveals a co-evolution across abstraction levels, where mastery of mid-level skills consistently precedes the emergence of effective high-level planning behaviors. Finally, we demonstrate that SCRIBE is additive to low-level tool optimizations, providing a scalable and complementary pathway toward more autonomous and reliable tool-using agents.",

To make reasoning more reliable and flexible, it is important to develop methods for controlling reasoning strategies. Existing methods struggle to control fine-grained reasoning strategies due to conceptual entanglement in LRMs' hidden states. To address this, we leverage Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to decompose strategy-entangled hidden states into a disentangled feature space. To identify the few strategy-specific features from the vast pool of SAE features, we propose SAE-Steering, an efficient two-stage feature identification pipeline. SAE-Steering first recalls features that amplify the logits of strategy-specific keywords, filtering out over 99\\% of features, and then ranks the remaining features by their control effectiveness. Using the identified strategy-specific features as control vectors, SAE-Steering outperforms existing methods by over 15\\% in control effectiveness. Furthermore, controlling reasoning strategies can redirect LRMs from erroneous paths to correct ones, achieving a 7\\% absolute accuracy improvement.",

However, our study shows that directly transferring such text-based reasoning paradigms to protein function understanding is ineffective: reinforcement learning mainly amplifies superficial keyword patterns while failing to introduce new biological knowledge, resulting in limited generalization. We argue that protein function prediction is a knowledge-intensive scientific task that fundamentally relies on external biological priors and computational tools rather than purely internal reasoning. To address this gap, we propose PFUA, a tool-augmented protein reasoning agent that unifies problem decomposition, tool invocation, and grounded answer generation. Instead of relying on long unconstrained reasoning traces, PFUA integrates domain-specific tools to produce verifiable intermediate evidence. Experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that PFUA consistently outperforms text-only reasoning models with an average performance improvement of 103%.",

We classify these patterns into three tiers: LLM Agents (task-specific automation), Agentic AI (adaptive goal-seekers), and Agentic Communities (organizational frameworks where AI agents and human participants coordinate through formal roles, protocols, and governance structures). We focus on Agentic Communities - coordination frameworks encompassing LLM Agents, Agentic AI entities, and humans - most relevant for enterprise and industrial applications. Drawing on established coordination principles from distributed systems, we ground these patterns in a formal framework that specifies collaboration agreements where AI agents and humans fill roles within governed ecosystems. This approach provides both practical guidance and formal verification capabilities, enabling expression of organizational, legal, and ethical rules through accountability mechanisms that ensure operational and verifiable governance of inter-agent communication, negotiation, and intent modeling.

Motivated by this finding, we propose SafeRemind, a decoding-time defense method that dynamically injects safe-reminding phrases into thinking steps. By leveraging entropy triggers to intervene at decision-locking points, SafeRemind redirects potentially harmful trajectories toward safer outcomes without requiring any parameter updates. Extensive evaluations across five LRMs and six benchmarks demonstrate that SafeRemind substantially enhances safety, achieving improvements of up to 45.5%p while preserving core reasoning utility.",

Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning improves accuracy but incurs prohibitive latency for real-time query correction. A potential solution is to output an answer before reasoning to reduce latency; however, under autoregressive decoding, the early answer is independent of subsequent reasoning, preventing the model from leveraging its reasoning capability to improve accuracy. To address this issue, we propose Sandwich Reasoning (SandwichR), a novel approach that explicitly aligns a fast initial answer with post-hoc reasoning, enabling low-latency query correction without sacrificing reasoning-aware accuracy. SandwichR follows an Answer-Reasoning-Answer paradigm, producing an initial correction, an explicit reasoning process, and a final refined correction. To align the initial answer with post-reasoning insights, we design a consistency-aware reinforcement learning (RL) strategy: a dedicated consistency reward enforces alignment between the initial and final corrections, while margin-based rejection sampling prioritizes borderline samples where reasoning drives the most impactful corrective gains. Additionally, we construct a high-quality query correction dataset, addressing the lack of specialized benchmarks for complex query correction. Experimental results demonstrate that SandwichR achieves SOTA accuracy comparable to standard CoT while delivering a 40-70% latency reduction, resolving the latency-accuracy trade-off in online search.",

Previous work successfully demonstrated that automated planners, using general domain-independent heuristics, are able to generate personalized treatments, when the domain and problems are modeled using a general domain description language (\\pddlp). Unfortunately, this process was limited in practice to consider no more than seven medications. In clinical terms, this is a non-starter. In this paper, we explore the use of automatically-generated domain- and problem-specific heuristics to be used with general search, as a method of scaling up medication planning to levels allowing closer work with clinicians. Specifically, we specify the domain programmatically (specifying an initial state and a successor generation procedure), and use an LLM to generate a problem specific heuristic that can be used by a fixed search algorithm (GBFS). The results indicate dramatic improvements in coverage and planning time, scaling up the number of medications to at least 28, and bringing medication planning one step closer to practical applications.",

This perspective highlights a meta-cognitive requirement -- anticipating task difficulty, estimating return over investment (ROI), and allocating computation strategically. We propose ROI-Reasoning, a two-stage framework that endows LLMs with intrinsic, budget-aware rationality. In the first stage, Meta-Cognitive Fine-Tuning teaches models to predict reasoning cost and expected utility before generation, enabling explicit solve-or-skip decisions. Next, Rationality-Aware Reinforcement Learning optimizes sequential decision making under a hard token budget, allowing models to learn long-horizon allocation strategies.

        "abstract": "Explainable artificial intelligence (xAI) has gained significant attention in recent years. Among other things, explainablility for deep neural networks has been a topic of intensive research due to the meteoric rise in prominence of deep neural networks and their \"black-box\" nature. xAI approaches can be characterized along different dimensions such as their scope (global versus local explanations) or underlying methodologies (statistic-based versus rule-based strategies). Methods generating global explanations aim to provide reasoning process applicable to all possible output classes while local explanation methods focus only on a single, specific class. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), a well-known statistical technique, identifies important features of a network. Deep neural network rule extraction method constructs IF-THEN rules that link input conditions to a class. Another approach focuses on generating counterfactuals which help explain how small changes to an input can affect the model's predictions. However, these techniques primarily focus on the input-output relationship and thus neglect the structure of the network in explanation generation.   In this work, we propose xDNN(ASP), an explanation generation system for deep neural networks that provides global explanations. Given a neural network model and its training data, xDNN(ASP) extracts a logic program under answer set semantics that-in the ideal case-represents the trained model, i.e., answer sets of the extracted program correspond one-to-one to input-output pairs of the network. We demonstrate experimentally, using two synthetic datasets, that not only the extracted logic program maintains a high-level of accuracy in the prediction task, but it also provides valuable information for the understanding of the model such as the importance of features as well as the impact of hidden nodes on the prediction. The latter can be used as a guide for reducing the number of nodes used in hidden layers, i.e., providing a means for optimizing the network.",

        "abstract": "Agents built on vision-language models increasingly face tasks that demand anticipating future states rather than relying on short-horizon reasoning. Generative world models offer a promising remedy: agents could use them as external simulators to foresee outcomes before acting. This paper empirically examines whether current agents can leverage such world models as tools to enhance their cognition. Across diverse agentic and visual question answering tasks, we observe that some agents rarely invoke simulation (fewer than 1%), frequently misuse predicted rollouts (approximately 15%), and often exhibit inconsistent or even degraded performance (up to 5%) when simulation is available or enforced. Attribution analysis further indicates that the primary bottleneck lies in the agents' capacity to decide when to simulate, how to interpret predicted outcomes, and how to integrate foresight into downstream reasoning. These findings underscore the need for mechanisms that foster calibrated, strategic interaction with world models, paving the way toward more reliable anticipatory cognition in future agent systems.",

However, extending this paradigm to financial decision is challenged by the market's stochastic nature: rewards are verifiable but inherently noisy, causing standard RL to degenerate into reward hacking. To address this, we propose Trade-R1, a model training framework that bridges verifiable rewards to stochastic environments via process-level reasoning verification. Our key innovation is a verification method that transforms the problem of evaluating reasoning over lengthy financial documents into a structured Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) task. We construct a triangular consistency metric, assessing pairwise alignment between retrieved evidence, reasoning chains, and decisions to serve as a validity filter for noisy market returns. We explore two reward integration strategies: Fixed-effect Semantic Reward (FSR) for stable alignment signals, and Dynamic-effect Semantic Reward (DSR) for coupled magnitude optimization. Experiments on different country asset selection demonstrate that our paradigm reduces reward hacking, with DSR achieving superior cross-market generalization while maintaining the highest reasoning consistency.",

However, this paradigm incurs substantial deployment costs as models often exhibit excessive verbosity on simple queries. Existing efficient reasoning methods relying on explicit length penalties often introduce optimization conflicts and leave the generative mechanisms driving overthinking largely unexamined. In this paper, we identify a phenomenon termed length shift where models increasingly generate unnecessary reasoning on trivial inputs during training. To address this, we introduce Dynamic Outlier Truncation (DOT), a training-time intervention that selectively suppresses redundant tokens. This method targets only the extreme tail of response lengths within fully correct rollout groups while preserving long-horizon reasoning capabilities for complex problems. To complement this intervention and ensure stable convergence, we further incorporate auxiliary KL regularization and predictive dynamic sampling. Experimental results across multiple model scales demonstrate that our approach significantly pushes the efficiency-performance Pareto frontier outward. Notably, on the AIME-24, our method reduces inference token usage by 78% while simultaneously increasing accuracy compared to the initial policy and surpassing state-of-the-art efficient reasoning methods.",

However, most existing agents remain reactive, making decisions mainly from current screen, which limits their performance on long-horizon tasks. Building a world model from repeated interactions enables forecasting action outcomes and supports better decision making for mobile GUI agents. This is challenging because the model must predict post-action states with spatial awareness while remaining efficient enough for practical deployment. In this paper, we propose MobileDreamer, an efficient world-model-based lookahead framework to equip the GUI agents based on the future imagination provided by the world model. It consists of textual sketch world model and rollout imagination for GUI agent. Textual sketch world model forecasts post-action states through a learning process to transform digital images into key task-related sketches, and designs a novel order-invariant learning strategy to preserve the spatial information of GUI elements. The rollout imagination strategy for GUI agent optimizes the action-selection process by leveraging the prediction capability of world model. Experiments on Android World show that MobileDreamer achieves state-of-the-art performance and improves task success by 5.25%. World model evaluations further verify that our textual sketch modeling accurately forecasts key GUI elements.",

However, their long-term behavioral stability remains largely unexamined. This study introduces the concept of agent drift, defined as the progressive degradation of agent behavior, decision quality, and inter-agent coherence over extended interaction sequences. We present a comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding drift phenomena, proposing three distinct manifestations: semantic drift (progressive deviation from original intent), coordination drift (breakdown in multi-agent consensus mechanisms), and behavioral drift (emergence of unintended strategies). We introduce the Agent Stability Index (ASI), a novel composite metric framework for quantifying drift across twelve dimensions, including response consistency, tool usage patterns, reasoning pathway stability, and inter-agent agreement rates. Through simulation-based analysis and theoretical modeling, we demonstrate how unchecked agent drift can lead to substantial reductions in task completion accuracy and increased human intervention requirements. We propose three mitigation strategies: episodic memory consolidation, drift-aware routing protocols, and adaptive behavioral anchoring. Theoretical analysis suggests these approaches can significantly reduce drift-related errors while maintaining system throughput. This work establishes a foundational methodology for monitoring, measuring, and mitigating agent drift in production agentic AI systems, with direct implications for enterprise deployment reliability and AI safety research.",

Current systems force a trade-off between convenience and privacy by routing sensitive financial data through centralized servers, increasing security risks, and diminishing user trust.

The proposed system operates exclusively on user hardware, enabling real-time bargaining while maintaining sensitive constraints locally. It integrates zero-knowledge proofs to ensure privacy and employs distilled world models to support advanced on-device reasoning. The architecture incorporates six technical components within an agentic AI workflow. Agents autonomously plan negotiation strategies, conduct secure multi-party bargaining, and generate cryptographic audit trails without exposing user data to external servers. The system is evaluated in insurance and B2B procurement scenarios across diverse device configurations. Results show an average success rate of 87%, a 2.4x latency improvement over cloud baselines, and strong privacy preservation through zero-knowledge proofs. User studies show 27% higher trust scores when decision trails are available. These findings establish a foundation for trustworthy autonomous agents in privacy-sensitive financial domains.",

Our results reveal the structural limits of internal reasoning: it causes performance collapse in weak models (the Prioritization Paradox) and leaves an 11.4\\% final output gap in frontier models. In contrast, RCA structurally eliminates sycophancy (0.0\\%) across all tiers. We synthesize these findings into a thermodynamic hierarchy: hybrid systems achieve Resonance (optimal efficiency) only when capabilities are matched and strong, while weak or mismatched pairs succumb to Dissonance and Entropy.

        "abstract": "This is the system card published alongside the OpenAI GPT-5 launch, August 2025. GPT-5 is a unified system with a smart and fast model that answers most questions, a deeper reasoning model for harder problems, and a real-time router that quickly decides which model to use based on conversation type, complexity, tool needs, and explicit intent (for example, if you say 'think hard about this' in the prompt). The router is continuously trained on real signals, including when users switch models, preference rates for responses, and measured correctness, improving over time. Once usage limits are reached, a mini version of each model handles remaining queries. This system card focuses primarily on gpt-5-thinking and gpt-5-main, while evaluations for other models are available in the appendix. The GPT-5 system not only outperforms previous models on benchmarks and answers questions more quickly, but -- more importantly -- is more useful for real-world queries. We've made significant advances in reducing hallucinations, improving instruction following, and minimizing sycophancy, and have leveled up GPT-5's performance in three of ChatGPT's most common uses: writing, coding, and health. All of the GPT-5 models additionally feature safe-completions, our latest approach to safety training to prevent disallowed content. Similarly to ChatGPT agent, we have decided to treat gpt-5-thinking as High capability in the Biological and Chemical domain under our Preparedness Framework, activating the associated safeguards. While we do not have definitive evidence that this model could meaningfully help a novice to create severe biological harm -- our defined threshold for High capability -- we have chosen to take a precautionary approach.",

Through systematic testing with samples and enterprise-grade evaluation protocols, we demonstrate that instruction following varies dramatically across models, with Claude-Sonnet-4 and GPT-5 achieving the highest results.

        "abstract": "The versatility of Large Language Models (LLMs) in vertical domains has spurred the development of numerous specialized evaluation benchmarks. However, these benchmarks often suffer from significant semantic redundancy and impose high computational costs during evaluation. Existing compression methods, such as tinyBenchmarks depend critically on correctness labels from multiple historical models evaluated on the full test set, making them inapplicable in cold-start scenarios, such as the introduction of a new task, domain, or model with no prior evaluation history. To address this limitation, we propose a history-free test set compression framework that requires no prior model performance data. Our method begins by fine-tuning a base LLM on a small amount of domain-specific data to internalize task-relevant semantics. It then generates high-level semantic embeddings for all original test samples using only their raw textual content. In this domain-adapted embedding space, we perform task-aware clustering and introduce a novel dataset X-ray mechanism that analyzes cluster geometry to dynamically calibrate the compression intensity based on the intrinsic redundancy of the benchmark. Experiments on professional-domain dataset, notably a large-scale 3GPP communications benchmark, demonstrate that our approach effectively identifies and removes redundant samples, reducing evaluation cost by over 90% while preserving high fidelity to the full benchmark.",

While existing LLMs can detect harmful or unsafe content, they often struggle with nuanced cases such as implicit offensiveness, subtle gender and racial biases, and jailbreak prompts, due to the subjective and context-dependent nature of these issues. Furthermore, their heavy reliance on training data can reinforce societal biases, resulting in inconsistent and ethically problematic outputs. To address these challenges, we introduce GuardEval, a unified multi-perspective benchmark dataset designed for both training and evaluation, containing 106 fine-grained categories spanning human emotions, offensive and hateful language, gender and racial bias, and broader safety concerns. We also present GemmaGuard (GGuard), a QLoRA fine-tuned version of Gemma3-12B trained on GuardEval, to assess content moderation with fine-grained labels. Our evaluation shows that GGuard achieves a macro F1 score of 0.832, substantially outperforming leading moderation models, including OpenAI Moderator (0.64) and Llama Guard (0.61). We show that multi-perspective, human-centered safety benchmarks are critical for reducing biased and inconsistent moderation decisions. GuardEval and GGuard together demonstrate that diverse, representative data materially improve safety, fairness, and robustness on complex, borderline cases.",

A quantum model for Markowitz portfolio optimization is presented that resolves this by embedding slack variables directly into the problem Hamiltonian. The method maps each slack variable to a dedicated ancilla qubit, transforming the problem into a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulation suitable for the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). This process internalizes the constraints within the quantum state, altering the problem's energy landscape to facilitate optimization. The model is empirically validated through simulation, showing it consistently finds the optimal portfolio where a standard penalty-based QAOA fails. This work demonstrates that modifying the Hamiltonian architecture via a slack-ancilla scheme provides a robust and effective pathway for solving constrained optimization problems on quantum computers. A fundamental quantum limit on the simultaneous precision of portfolio risk and return is also posited.",

However, existing evaluations rarely assess whether such agents remain safe, protocol compliant, and effective under realistic next generation networking constraints. This paper introduces $\\alpha^3$-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating LLM driven UAV autonomy as a multi turn conversational reasoning and control problem operating under dynamic 6G conditions. Each mission is formulated as a language mediated control loop between an LLM based UAV agent and a human operator, where decisions must satisfy strict schema validity, mission policies, speaker alternation, and safety constraints while adapting to fluctuating network slices, latency, jitter, packet loss, throughput, and edge load variations. To reflect modern agentic workflows, $\\alpha^3$-Bench integrates a dual action layer supporting both tool calls and agent to agent coordination, enabling evaluation of tool use consistency and multi agent interactions. We construct a large scale corpus of 113k conversational UAV episodes grounded in UAVBench scenarios and evaluate 17 state of the art LLMs using a fixed subset of 50 episodes per scenario under deterministic decoding. We propose a composite $\\alpha^3$ metric that unifies six pillars: Task Outcome, Safety Policy, Tool Consistency, Interaction Quality, Network Robustness, and Communication Cost, with efficiency normalized scores per second and per thousand tokens. Results show that while several models achieve high mission success and safety compliance, robustness and efficiency vary significantly under degraded 6G conditions, highlighting the need for network aware and resource efficient LLM based UAV agents.

Our approach follows a five-stage pipeline. First, we generate IL candidates by pairing available cation and anion molecules, then predict temperature- and pressure-dependent CO2 solubility and viscosity using a GNN-based molecular property prediction model. Next, we convert solubility to working capacity and regeneration energy via Van't Hoff modeling, and then find the best set of candidates using Pareto optimization, before finally filtering those based on feasible synthesis routes. We identify 36 feasible candidates that could enable 5-10% OPEX savings and up to 10% CAPEX reductions through lower regeneration energy requirements and reduced corrosivity-offering a novel carbon-capture strategy for refineries moving forward.",

Assessing how LLMs respond to user dissent is crucial for understanding their reliability and behavior patterns, yet the complexity of human-LLM interactions makes systematic evaluation challenging. Our approach employs a fictitious-response rebuttal method that quantifies LLM behavior when presented with multiple-choice questions followed by deliberate challenges to their fictitious previous response. The indices are specifically designed to detect and measure what could be characterized as sycophantic behavior (excessive agreement with user challenges) or stubborn responses (rigid adherence to the fictitious response in the chat history) from LLMs. These metrics allow investigation of the relationships between sycophancy, stubbornness, and the model's actual mastery of the subject matter. We demonstrate the utility of these indices using two physics problems as test scenarios with various OpenAI models. The framework is intentionally generalizable to any multiple-choice format question, including on topics without universally accepted correct answers. Our results reveal measurable differences across OpenAI model generations, with trends indicating that newer models and those employing greater \"Reasoning Effort\" exhibit reduced sycophantic behavior. The FR pairing method combined with our proposed indices provides a practical, adaptable toolkit for systematically comparing LLM dialogue behaviors across different models and contexts.",

        "abstract": "Cybersecurity post-incident reviews are essential for identifying control failures and improving organisational resilience, yet they remain labour-intensive, time-consuming, and heavily reliant on expert judgment. This paper investigates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can augment post-incident review workflows by autonomously analysing system evidence and identifying security policy gaps. We present a threat-informed, agentic framework that ingests log data, maps observed behaviours to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, and evaluates organisational security policies for adequacy and compliance. Using a simulated brute-force attack scenario against a Windows OpenSSH service (MITRE ATT&CK T1110), the system leverages GPT-4o for reasoning, LangGraph for multi-agent workflow orchestration, and LlamaIndex for traceable policy retrieval. Experimental results indicate that the LLM-based pipeline can interpret log-derived evidence, identify insufficient or missing policy controls, and generate actionable remediation recommendations with explicit evidence-to-policy traceability. Unlike prior work that treats log analysis and policy validation as isolated tasks, this study integrates both into a unified end-to-end proof-of-concept post-incident review framework. The findings suggest that LLM-assisted analysis has the potential to improve the efficiency, consistency, and auditability of post-incident evaluations, while highlighting the continued need for human oversight in high-stakes cybersecurity decision-making.",

This comprehensive survey examines lightweight transformer architectures specifically designed for edge deployment, analyzing recent advances in model compression, quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation techniques. We systematically review prominent lightweight variants including MobileBERT, TinyBERT, DistilBERT, EfficientFormer, EdgeFormer, and MobileViT, providing detailed performance benchmarks on standard datasets such as GLUE, SQuAD, ImageNet-1K, and COCO. Our analysis encompasses current industry adoption patterns across major hardware platforms (NVIDIA Jetson, Qualcomm Snapdragon, Apple Neural Engine, ARM architectures), deployment frameworks (TensorFlow Lite, ONNX Runtime, PyTorch Mobile, CoreML), and optimization strategies. Experimental results demonstrate that modern lightweight transformers can achieve 75-96% of full-model accuracy while reducing model size by 4-10x and inference latency by 3-9x, enabling deployment on devices with as little as 2-5W power consumption. We identify sparse attention mechanisms, mixed-precision quantization (INT8/FP16), and hardware-aware neural architecture search as the most effective optimization strategies. Novel findings include memory-bandwidth bottleneck analysis revealing 15-40M parameter models achieve optimal hardware utilization (60-75% efficiency), quantization sweet spots for different model types, and comprehensive energy efficiency profiling across edge platforms. We establish real-time performance boundaries and provide a practical 6-step deployment pipeline achieving 8-12x size reduction with less than 2% accuracy degradation.",

While content watermarking effectively attributes LLM-generated outputs, it fails to directly identify the high-level planning behaviors (e.g., tool and subgoal choices) that govern multi-step execution. Critically, watermarking at the planning-behavior layer faces unique challenges: minor distributional deviations in decision-making can compound during long-term agent operation, degrading utility, and many agents operate as black boxes that are difficult to intervene in directly. To bridge this gap, we propose AgentMark, a behavioral watermarking framework that embeds multi-bit identifiers into planning decisions while preserving utility. It operates by eliciting an explicit behavior distribution from the agent and applying distribution-preserving conditional sampling, enabling deployment under black-box APIs while remaining compatible with action-layer content watermarking. Experiments across embodied, tool-use, and social environments demonstrate practical multi-bit capacity, robust recovery from partial logs, and utility preservation.

The project has been running since November 21, 2025 and has as of January 4, 2026, produced 160k lines of formalized topology. Most of it (about 130k lines) have been done in two weeks,from December 22 to January 4, for an LLM subscription cost of about \\$100. This includes a 3k-line proof of Urysohn's lemma, a 2k-line proof of Urysohn's Metrization theorem, over 10k-line proof of the Tietze extension theorem, and many more (in total over 1.5k lemmas/theorems). The approach is quite simple and cheap: build a long-running feedback loop between an LLM and a reasonably fast proof checker equipped with a core foundational library. The LLM is now instantiated as ChatGPT (mostly 5.2) or Claude Sonnet (4.5) run through the respective Codex or Claude Code command line interfaces. The proof checker is Chad Brown's higher-order set theory system Megalodon, and the core library is Brown's formalization of basic set theory and surreal numbers (including reals, etc). The rest is some prompt engineering and technical choices which we describe here. Based on the fast progress, low cost, virtually unknown ITP/library, and the simple setup available to everyone, we believe that (auto)formalization may become quite easy and ubiquitous in 2026, regardless of which proof assistant is used.",

To address these challenges, we propose PC2P, a novel distributed MAPF method derived from a Q-learning-based MARL framework. Initially, we introduce a personalized-enhanced communication mechanism based on dynamic graph topology, which ascertains the core aspects of ``who\" and ``what\" in interactive process through three-stage operations: selection, generation, and aggregation. Concurrently, we incorporate local crowd perception to enrich agents' heuristic observation, thereby strengthening the model's guidance for effective actions via the integration of static spatial constraints and dynamic occupancy changes. To resolve extreme deadlock issues, we propose a region-based deadlock-breaking strategy that leverages expert guidance to implement efficient coordination within confined areas. Experimental results demonstrate that PC2P achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art distributed MAPF methods in varied environments.

This paper revisits a fundamental yet seldom systematically studied question: how VLM choice and competence translate to downstream VLA policies performance? We introduce VLM4VLA, a minimal adaptation pipeline that converts general-purpose VLMs into VLA policies using only a small set of new learnable parameters for fair and efficient comparison. Despite its simplicity, VLM4VLA proves surprisingly competitive with more sophisticated network designs. Through extensive empirical studies on various downstream tasks across three benchmarks, we find that while VLM initialization offers a consistent benefit over training from scratch, a VLM's general capabilities are poor predictors of its downstream task performance. This challenges common assumptions, indicating that standard VLM competence is necessary but insufficient for effective embodied control. We further investigate the impact of specific embodied capabilities by fine-tuning VLMs on seven auxiliary embodied tasks (e.g., embodied QA, visual pointing, depth estimation). Contrary to intuition, improving a VLM's performance on specific embodied skills does not guarantee better downstream control performance. Finally, modality-level ablations identify the visual module in VLM, rather than the language component, as the primary performance bottleneck. We demonstrate that injecting control-relevant supervision into the vision encoder of the VLM yields consistent gains, even when the encoder remains frozen during downstream fine-tuning. This isolates a persistent domain gap between current VLM pretraining objectives and the requirements of embodied action-planning.",

We start with an intrinsic Gaussian curvature-based surface exaggeration technique, which, when coupled with texture, tends to produce over-smoothed renders. To address this, we resort to 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), which has recently been shown to produce realistic free-viewpoint avatars. Given a multiview sequence, we extract a FLAME mesh, solve a curvature-weighted Poisson equation, and obtain its exaggerated form. However, directly deforming the Gaussians yields poor results, necessitating the synthesis of pseudo-ground-truth caricature images by warping each frame to its exaggerated 2D representation using local affine transformations. We then devise a training scheme that alternates real and synthesized supervision, enabling a single Gaussian collection to represent both natural and exaggerated avatars. This scheme improves fidelity, supports local edits, and allows continuous control over the intensity of the caricature. In order to achieve real-time deformations, an efficient interpolation between the original and exaggerated surfaces is introduced. We further analyze and show that it has a bounded deviation from closed-form solutions. In both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, our results outperform prior work, delivering photorealistic, geometry-controlled caricature avatars.",

        "abstract": "On-policy reinforcement learning (RL), particularly Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), has become the dominant paradigm for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). While policy ratio clipping stabilizes training, this heuristic hard constraint incurs a fundamental cost: it indiscriminately truncates gradients from high-return yet high-divergence actions, suppressing rare but highly informative \"eureka moments\" in complex reasoning. Moreover, once data becomes slightly stale, hard clipping renders it unusable, leading to severe sample inefficiency. In this work, we revisit the trust-region objective in policy optimization and show that explicitly constraining the \\emph{variance (second central moment) of the policy ratio} provides a principled and smooth relaxation of hard clipping. This distributional constraint stabilizes policy updates while preserving gradient signals from valuable trajectories. Building on this insight, we propose $R^2VPO$ (Ratio-Variance Regularized Policy Optimization), a novel primal-dual framework that supports stable on-policy learning and enables principled off-policy data reuse by dynamically reweighting stale samples rather than discarding them. We extensively evaluate $R^2VPO$ on fine-tuning state-of-the-art LLMs, including DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B and the openPangu-Embedded series (1B and 7B), across challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Experimental results show that $R^2VPO$ consistently achieves superior asymptotic performance, with average relative gains of up to 17% over strong clipping-based baselines, while requiring approximately 50% fewer rollouts to reach convergence. These findings establish ratio-variance control as a promising direction for improving both stability and data efficiency in RL-based LLM alignment.",

To address these challenges, we propose a comprehensive framework for self-consistent radiology report generation. First, we conduct a systematic evaluation to identify optimal vision encoder and LLM backbone configurations for medical imaging. Building on this foundation, we introduce a novel \"Reason-then-Summarize\" architecture optimized via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). This framework restructures generation into two distinct components: a think block for detailed findings and an answer block for structured disease labels. By utilizing a multi-dimensional composite reward function, we explicitly penalize logical discrepancies between the generated narrative and the final diagnosis.

However, their utility is currently limited because EEG decoding often suffers from poor generalization due to distribution shifts across domains (e.g., subjects). Learning robust representations that capture underlying task-relevant information would mitigate these shifts and improve generalization. One promising approach is to exploit the underlying hierarchical structure in EEG, as recent studies suggest that hierarchical cognitive processes, such as visual processing, can be encoded in EEG. While many decoding methods still rely on Euclidean embeddings, recent work has begun exploring hyperbolic geometry for EEG. Hyperbolic spaces, regarded as the continuous analogue of tree structures, provide a natural geometry for representing hierarchical data. In this study, we first empirically demonstrate that EEG data exhibit hyperbolicity and show that hyperbolic embeddings improve generalization. Motivated by these findings, we propose HEEGNet, a hybrid hyperbolic network architecture to capture the hierarchical structure in EEG and learn domain-invariant hyperbolic embeddings. To this end, HEEGNet combines both Euclidean and hyperbolic encoders and employs a novel coarse-to-fine domain adaptation strategy. Extensive experiments on multiple public EEG datasets, covering visual evoked potentials, emotion recognition, and intracranial EEG, demonstrate that HEEGNet achieves state-of-the-art performance.",

Standard inference runtimes often incur significant overhead through high-level abstractions, dynamic dispatch, and unaligned memory access patterns. In this work, we present a novel \"Virtual Tensor Core\" architecture implemented in software, optimized specifically for ARM64 microarchitectures (Apple Silicon). By bypassing standard library containers in favor of direct memory mapping (mmap) and implementing hand-tuned NEON SIMD kernels, we achieve a form of \"Software-Defined Direct Memory Access (DMA).\" Our proposed Tensor Virtualization Layout (TVL) guarantees 100% cache line utilization for weight matrices, while our zero-copy loader eliminates initialization latency. Experimental results on a 110M parameter model demonstrate a stable throughput of >60 tokens/second on M2 hardware. While proprietary hardware accelerators (e.g., Apple AMX) can achieve higher peak throughput, our architecture provides a fully open, portable, and deterministic reference implementation for studying the memory bottleneck on general-purpose ARM silicon, meeting the 200ms psycholinguistic latency threshold without opaque dependencies.",

In this work, we introduce the first ordinal classification framework for forecasting wildfire severity levels directly aligned with operational decision-making in France. Our study investigates the influence of loss-function design on the ability of neural models to predict rare yet critical high-severity fire occurrences. We compare standard cross-entropy with several ordinal-aware objectives, including the proposed probabilistic TDeGPD loss derived from a truncated discrete exponentiated Generalized Pareto Distribution. Through extensive benchmarking over multiple architectures and real operational data, we show that ordinal supervision substantially improves model performance over conventional approaches. In particular, the Weighted Kappa Loss (WKLoss) achieves the best overall results, with more than +0.1 IoU gain on the most extreme severity classes while maintaining competitive calibration quality. However, performance remains limited for the rarest events due to their extremely low representation in the dataset. These findings highlight the importance of integrating both severity ordering, data imbalance considerations, and seasonality risk into wildfire forecasting systems. Future work will focus on incorporating seasonal dynamics and uncertainty information into training to further improve the reliability of extreme-event prediction.",

In this work, we investigate the problem in the scope of the emergent misalignment problem where LLMs can generalize patterns learned from misaligned content in one domain to another domain. We discover a strong causal relationship between metaphors in training data and the misalignment degree of LLMs' reasoning contents. With interventions using metaphors in pre-training, fine-tuning and re-alignment phases, models' cross-domain misalignment degrees change significantly. As we delve deeper into the causes behind this phenomenon, we observe that there is a connection between metaphors and the activation of global and local latent features of large reasoning models. By monitoring these latent features, we design a detector that predict misaligned content with high accuracy.",

However, current safety evaluations often overestimate robustness because existing automated attacks are limited by restrictive assumptions. They typically rely on handcrafted priors or require white-box access for gradient propagation. We challenge these constraints by demonstrating that token-level iterative optimization can succeed without gradients or priors. We introduce RAILS (RAndom Iterative Local Search), a framework that operates solely on model logits. RAILS matches the effectiveness of gradient-based methods through two key innovations: a novel auto-regressive loss that enforces exact prefix matching, and a history-based selection strategy that bridges the gap between the proxy optimization objective and the true attack success rate. Crucially, by eliminating gradient dependency, RAILS enables cross-tokenizer ensemble attacks. This allows for the discovery of shared adversarial patterns that generalize across disjoint vocabularies, significantly enhancing transferability to closed-source systems. Empirically, RAILS achieves near 100% success rates on multiple open-source models and high black-box attack transferability to closed-source systems like GPT and Gemini.",

Across 12 models and 10 languages, these measures yield stable ``spectral fingerprints'' that expose discontinuities missed by standard evaluation. We report four results.

We term this scar \\textit{Passive-Triggered Connectivity Collapse} (PTCC). Analysis of the Phi lineage reveals that PTCC appears and resolves across developmental stages, implicating brittle curriculum shifts rather than synthetic data per se. (2) PTCC reflects a specialization trade-off: strengthened formal routing at the expense of stylistic flexibility. (3) We identify four recurrent processing strategies; simple frozen-threshold rules enable perfect forensic identification across lineages. (4) Mechanistically, PTCC localizes to a sparse Layer 2 ``compensatory patch'' of heads that fails under syntactic stress; activation steering can partially restore connectivity, recovering $\\approx 38\\%$ of lost information flow. Finally, dominant topological regimes track tokenization density more than language identity, suggesting ``healthy'' geometry varies systematically across scripts.

This is a compact coalition of routed experts that consistently captures the majority of routing mass across domains, layers, and routing budgets, even when architectures already include shared experts. Qualitative analysis further shows that Standing Committees anchor reasoning structure and syntax, while peripheral experts handle domain-specific knowledge. These findings reveal a strong structural bias toward centralized computation, suggesting that specialization in Mixture of Experts models is far less pervasive than commonly believed. This inherent bias also indicates that current training objectives, such as load-balancing losses that enforce uniform expert utilization, may be working against the model's natural optimization path, thereby limiting training efficiency and performance.",

We applied this framework in the context of gravitational-wave research related to the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory. Answers are grounded in a curated semantic index of research literature, doctoral theses, LIGO documents, and long-running detector electronic logbooks, with targeted web searches when appropriate. Because direct benchmarking against commercial LLMs cannot be performed on private data, we evaluated MARVEL on two publicly available surrogate datasets that capture comparable semantic and technical characteristics. On these benchmarks, MARVEL matches a GPT-4o mini baseline on literature-centric queries and substantially outperforms it on detector-operations content, where domain retrieval and guided reasoning are decisive.

We consider both middle-band ($4\\to 16$~kHz) and full-band ($16\\to 48$~kHz) upsampling tasks for speech and music, training linear classifiers to distinguish real from synthetic samples based on multiple types of audio embeddings. Comparisons with objective metrics and subjective listening tests reveal that embedding-based classifiers achieve near-perfect separation, even when the generated audio attains high perceptual quality and state-of-the-art metric scores. This behavior is consistent across datasets and models, including recent diffusion-based approaches, highlighting a persistent gap between perceptual quality and true distributional fidelity in ADSR models.",

Using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) to measure absolute agreement, we find that LLM judgments are not perfectly consistent across scales on subjective benchmarks, and that the choice of scale substantially shifts human-LLM agreement, even when within-group panel reliability is high. Aggregated over tasks, the grading scale of 0-5 yields the strongest human-LLM alignment. We further demonstrate that pooled reliability can mask benchmark heterogeneity and reveal systematic subgroup differences in alignment across gender groups, strengthening the importance of scale design and sub-level diagnostics as essential components of LLM-as-a-judge protocols.",

We propose a soft-contextualized encoder architecture for UDTC which contextualizes each candidate label with the label set and a static soft prompt representation of the input query. Training on diverse, multi-source datasets enables the model to generalize effectively to zero-shot classification over entirely unseen topic sets drawn from arbitrary domains.

This paper develops an economic foundation for multi-agent learning by studying a principal-agent interaction in a Markov decision process with strategic externalities, where both the principal and the agent learn over time. We propose a two-phase incentive mechanism that first estimates implementable transfers and then uses them to steer long-run dynamics; under mild regret-based rationality and exploration conditions, the mechanism achieves sublinear social-welfare regret and thus asymptotically optimal welfare. Simulations illustrate how even coarse incentives can correct inefficient learning under stateful externalities, highlighting the necessity of incentive-aware design for safe and welfare-aligned AI in markets and insurance.",

We propose a unified EM-based framework that combines source and target data through the DAG structure to transfer information from observed variables to the missing target. On the methodological side, we formulate a population EM operator in the DAG parameter space and introduce a first-order (gradient) EM update that replaces the costly generalized least-squares M-step with a single projected gradient step. Under standard local strong-concavity and smoothness assumptions and a BWY-style \\cite{Balakrishnan2017EM} gradient-stability (bounded missing-information) condition, we show that this first-order EM operator is locally contractive around the true target parameters, yielding geometric convergence and finite-sample guarantees on parameter error and the induced target-imputation error in Gaussian SEMs under covariate shift and local mechanism shifts. Algorithmically, we exploit the known causal DAG to freeze source-invariant mechanisms and re-estimate only those conditional distributions directly affected by the shift, making the procedure scalable to higher-dimensional models. In experiments on a synthetic seven-node SEM, the 64-node MAGIC-IRRI genetic network, and the Sachs protein-signaling data, the proposed DAG-aware first-order EM algorithm improves target imputation accuracy over a fit-on-source Bayesian network and a Kiiveri-style EM baseline, with the largest gains under pronounced domain shift.",

        "abstract": "Students from different socioeconomic backgrounds exhibit persistent gaps in test scores, gaps that can translate into unequal educational and labor-market outcomes later in life. In many assessments, performance reflects not only what students know, but also how effectively they can communicate that knowledge. This distinction is especially salient in writing assessments, where scores jointly reward the substance of students' ideas and the way those ideas are expressed. As a result, observed score gaps may conflate differences in underlying content with differences in expressive skill. A central question, therefore, is how much of the socioeconomic-status (SES) gap in scores is driven by differences in what students say versus how they say it. We study this question using a large corpus of persuasive essays written by U.S. middle- and high-school students. We introduce a new measurement strategy that separates content from style by leveraging large language models to generate multiple stylistic variants of each essay. These rewrites preserve the underlying arguments while systematically altering surface expression, creating a \"generated panel\" that introduces controlled within-essay variation in style. This approach allows us to decompose SES gaps in writing scores into contributions from content and style. We find an SES gap of 0.67 points on a 1-6 scale. Approximately 69% of the gap is attributable to differences in essay content quality, Style differences account for 26% of the gap, and differences in evaluation standards across SES groups account for the remaining 5%. These patterns seems stable across demographic subgroups and writing tasks. More broadly, our approach shows how large language models can be used to generate controlled variation in observational data, enabling researchers to isolate and quantify the contributions of otherwise entangled factors.",

The subsets respectively evaluate text-grounded factual recall, multi-step inference linking document evidence with epidemiological principles, and conclusion reconstruction with the Discussion section withheld. Construction combines expert-designed taxonomy guidance, multi-model verification, and retrieval-based difficulty control. Experiments on ten open models reveal that current LLMs show limited performance on epidemiological reasoning, with multi-step inference posing the greatest challenge. Model rankings shift across subsets, and scale alone does not predict success. Chain-of-Thought prompting benefits multi-step inference but yields mixed results elsewhere.

        "abstract": "Linear text segmentation is a long-standing problem in natural language processing (NLP), focused on dividing continuous text into coherent and semantically meaningful units. Despite its importance, the task remains challenging due to the complexity of defining topic boundaries, the variability in discourse structure, and the need to balance local coherence with global context. These difficulties hinder downstream applications such as summarization, information retrieval, and question answering. In this work, we introduce SegNSP, framing linear text segmentation as a next sentence prediction (NSP) task. Although NSP has largely been abandoned in modern pre-training, its explicit modeling of sentence-to-sentence continuity makes it a natural fit for detecting topic boundaries. We propose a label-agnostic NSP approach, which predicts whether the next sentence continues the current topic without requiring explicit topic labels, and enhance it with a segmentation-aware loss combined with harder negative sampling to better capture discourse continuity. Unlike recent proposals that leverage NSP alongside auxiliary topic classification, our approach avoids task-specific supervision. We evaluate our model against established baselines on two datasets, CitiLink-Minutes, for which we establish the first segmentation benchmark, and WikiSection. On CitiLink-Minutes, SegNSP achieves a B-$F_1$ of 0.79, closely aligning with human-annotated topic transitions, while on WikiSection it attains a B-F$_1$ of 0.65, outperforming the strongest reproducible baseline, TopSeg, by 0.17 absolute points. These results demonstrate competitive and robust performance, highlighting the effectiveness of modeling sentence-to-sentence continuity for improving segmentation quality and supporting downstream NLP applications.",

        "abstract": "Vehicle-to-building (V2B) systems integrate physical infrastructures, such as smart buildings and electric vehicles (EVs) connected to chargers at the building, with digital control mechanisms to manage energy use. By utilizing EVs as flexible energy reservoirs, buildings can dynamically charge and discharge them to optimize energy use and cut costs under time-variable pricing and demand charge policies. This setup leads to the V2B optimization problem, where buildings coordinate EV charging and discharging to minimize total electricity costs while meeting users' charging requirements. However, the V2B optimization problem is challenging because of: (1) fluctuating electricity pricing, which includes both energy charges ($/kWh) and demand charges ($/kW); (2) long planning horizons (typically over 30 days); (3) heterogeneous chargers with varying charging rates, controllability, and directionality (i.e., unidirectional or bidirectional); and (4) user-specific battery levels at departure to ensure user requirements are met. In contrast to existing approaches that often model this setting as a single-shot combinatorial optimization problem, we highlight critical limitations in prior work and instead model the V2B optimization problem as a Markov decision process (MDP), i.e., a stochastic control process. Solving the resulting MDP is challenging due to the large state and action spaces. To address the challenges of the large state space, we leverage online search, and we counter the action space by using domain-specific heuristics to prune unpromising actions. We validate our approach in collaboration with Nissan Advanced Technology Center - Silicon Valley. Using data from their EV testbed, we show that the proposed framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.",

Though the scaling law has been validated for sequential models, it showed inefficiency in computational capacity when considering real-world applications like recommendation, due to the non-linear(quadratic) increasing nature of the transformer model. To improve the efficiency of the sequential model, we introduced a novel approach to sequential recommendation that leverages personalization techniques to enhance efficiency and performance. Our method compresses long user interaction histories into learnable tokens, which are then combined with recent interactions to generate recommendations. This approach significantly reduces computational costs while maintaining high recommendation accuracy. Our method could be applied to existing transformer based recommendation models, e.g., HSTU and HLLM. Extensive experiments on multiple sequential models demonstrate its versatility and effectiveness. Source code is available at \\href{this https URL}{this https URL}.",

In this work, a complete virtual microgrid was designed and implemented in MATLAB/Simulink, integrating heterogeneous renewable sources and secondary controller layers. A structured cyberattack framework was developed using MGLib to inject adversarial signals directly into the secondary control pathways. Multiple attack classes were emulated, including ramp, sinusoidal, additive, coordinated stealth, and denial of service behaviors. The virtual environment was used to generate labeled datasets under both normal and attack conditions. The datasets trained Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) models to perform two functions: detecting the presence of an intrusion (binary) and distinguishing among attack types (multiclass). The multiclass model attained 99.72% accuracy and a 99.62% F1 score, while the binary model attained 94.8% accuracy and a 94.3% F1 score. A knowledge-distillation step reduced the size of the multiclass model, allowing faster predictions with only a small drop in performance. Real-time tests showed a processing delay of about 54 to 67 ms per 1000 samples, demonstrating suitability for CPU-based edge deployment in microgrid controllers. The results confirm that lightweight machine learning based intrusion detection methods can provide fast, accurate, and efficient cyberattack detection without relying on complex deep learning models. Key contributions include: (1) development of a complete MATLAB-based virtual microgrid, (2) structured attack injection at the control layer, (3) creation of multiclass labeled datasets, and (4) design of low-cost AI models suitable for practical microgrid cybersecurity.",

KR-Test utilizes automatically generated contrastive examples to measure likelihood preferences for correct versus incorrect continuations, requiring no instruction tuning or generative decoding. We validate the framework's integrity through a \"blind vs. oracle\" baseline analysis. Furthermore, we demonstrate the diagnostic capabilities of KR-Test by analyzing the training dynamics of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). By exposing the fine-grained dissociation between linguistic convergence and knowledge retention, KR-Test enhances the interpretability of fine-tuning dynamics.",

Existing speed-up approaches typically rely on retraining the model or designing sophisticated prompting, which are either prohibitively expensive or highly sensitive to the input and prompt formulation. In this work, we study model merging as a lightweight alternative for efficient reasoning: by combining a long chain-of-thought (Long-CoT) reasoning model with a Short-CoT instruction model, we obtain an adaptive reasoner without training from scratch or requiring large-scale additional data. Building on this idea, we propose Reasoning Pattern Alignment Merging (RPAM), a layer-wise model merging framework based on feature alignment to facilitate query-adaptive reasoning. RPAM first constructs a small pattern-labeled calibration set that assigns each query an appropriate reasoning pattern. It then optimizes layer-wise merging coefficients by aligning the merged model's intermediate representations with those of the selected model, while a contrastive objective explicitly pushes them away from the non-selected model. Experiments on seven widely used reasoning benchmarks show that RPAM substantially reduces inference cost while maintaining strong performance. Upon article acceptance, we will provide open-source code to reproduce experiments for RPAM.",

Existing approaches rely on external classifiers, most commonly BERT based models, which suffer from limited context windows, constrained representational capacity, and additional computational overhead. We propose IntroLM, a method that enables causal language models to predict their own output quality during the prefilling phase without affecting generation using introspective tokens. By introducing token conditional LoRA that activates only for the introspective token, the model learns to predict the output quality for a given query while preserving the original backbone behavior and avoiding external evaluators. On question answering benchmarks, IntroLM applied to Qwen3 8B achieves a ROC AUC of 90 precent for success prediction, outperforming a DeBERTa classifier by 14 precent. When integrated into multi model routing systems, IntroLM achieves superior cost performance tradeoffs, reducing latency by up to 33 precent and large model usage by up to 50 precent at matched reliability.",

We present Deploy-Master, a one-stop agentic workflow for large-scale tool discovery, build specification inference, execution-based validation, and publication. Guided by a taxonomy spanning 90+ scientific and engineering domains, our discovery stage starts from a recall-oriented pool of over 500,000 public repositories and progressively filters it to 52,550 executable tool candidates under license- and quality-aware criteria. Deploy-Master transforms heterogeneous open-source repositories into runnable, containerized capabilities grounded in execution rather than documentation claims. In a single day, we performed 52,550 build attempts and constructed reproducible runtime environments for 50,112 scientific tools. Each successful tool is validated by a minimal executable command and registered in SciencePedia for search and reuse, enabling direct human use and optional agent-based invocation. Beyond delivering runnable tools, we report a deployment trace at the scale of 50,000 tools, characterizing throughput, cost profiles, failure surfaces, and specification uncertainty that become visible only at scale.

Thus, we introduce Mem-Gallery, a new benchmark for evaluating multimodal long-term conversational memory in MLLM agents. Mem-Gallery features high-quality multi-session conversations grounded in both visual and textual information, with long interaction horizons and rich multimodal dependencies. Building on this dataset, we propose a systematic evaluation framework that assesses key memory capabilities along three functional dimensions: memory extraction and test-time adaptation, memory reasoning, and memory knowledge management.

Mainstream pass/fail outcome rewards enforce functional correctness via executing unit tests, but the resulting sparsity limits potential performance gains.

The core idea of VeRPO is constructing dense rewards from weighted partial success: by dynamically estimating the difficulty weight of each unit test based on the execution statistics during training, a dense reward is derived from the sum of weights of the passed unit tests. To solidify the consistency between partial success and end-to-end functional correctness, VeRPO further integrates the dense signal with global execution outcomes, establishing a robust and dense reward paradigm relying solely on verifiable execution feedback. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and settings demonstrate that VeRPO consistently outperforms outcome-driven and RM-based baselines, achieving up to +8.83\\% gain in pass@1 with negligible time cost (< 0.02\\%) and zero GPU memory overhead.",

Through systematic analyses on real-world multi-hop queries, we show that this hop-aligned assumption does not generalize: later-hop answer entities can become decodable earlier than bridge entities, a phenomenon we call \\emph{layer-order inversion}, which strengthens with total hops. To explain this behavior, we propose a \\emph{probabilistic recall-and-extract} framework that models multi-hop reasoning as broad probabilistic recall in shallow MLP layers followed by selective extraction in deeper attention layers. This framework is empirically validated through systematic probing analyses, reinterpreting prior layer-wise decoding evidence, explaining chain-of-thought gains, and providing a mechanistic diagnosis of multi-hop failures despite correct single-hop knowledge.

We introduce a context-based assessment protocol that sequentially administers standardized questionnaires for privacy attitudes, prosocialness, and acceptance of data sharing within a bounded, history-carrying session. To evaluate value-action alignments under competing attitudes, we use multi-group structural equation modeling (MGSEM) to identify relations from privacy concerns and prosocialness to data sharing. We propose Value-Action Alignment Rate (VAAR), a human-referenced directional agreement metric that aggregates path-level evidence for expected signs.

This study examines the limitations of existing datasets and emphasizes the temporal characteristics of key features relevant to hypoglycemia prediction. A comprehensive analysis of imputation techniques is conducted, focusing on those employed in state-of-the-art studies. Furthermore, imputation methods derived from machine learning and deep learning applications in other healthcare contexts are evaluated for their potential to address longer gaps in time-series data. Based on this analysis, a systematic paradigm is proposed, wherein imputation strategies are tailored to the nature of specific features and the duration of missing intervals. The review concludes by emphasizing the importance of investigating the temporal dynamics of individual features and the implementation of multiple, feature-specific imputation techniques to effectively address heterogeneous temporal patterns inherent in the data.",

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) show strong reasoning ability in open-domain question answering, yet their reasoning processes are typically linear and often logically inconsistent. In contrast, real-world reasoning requires integrating multiple premises and solving subproblems in parallel. Existing methods, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), express reasoning in a linear textual form, which may appear coherent but frequently leads to inconsistent conclusions. Recent approaches rely on externally provided graphs and do not explore how LLMs can construct and use their own graph-structured reasoning, particularly in open-domain QA. To fill this gap, we novelly explore graph-structured reasoning of LLMs in general-domain question answering. We propose Self-Graph Reasoning (SGR), a framework that enables LLMs to explicitly represent their reasoning process as a structured graph before producing the final answer. We further construct a graph-structured reasoning dataset that merges multiple candidate reasoning graphs into refined graph structures for model training. Experiments on five QA benchmarks across both general and specialized domains show that SGR consistently improves reasoning consistency and yields a 17.74% gain over the base model. The LLaMA-3.3-70B model fine-tuned with SGR performs comparably to GPT-4o and surpasses Claude-3.5-Haiku, demonstrating the effectiveness of graph-structured reasoning.",

Existing detection methods mainly detect jailbreak status relying on jailbreak templates present in the training data. However, few studies address the more realistic and challenging zero-shot jailbreak detection setting, where no jailbreak templates are available during training. This setting better reflects real-world scenarios where new attacks continually emerge and evolve. To address this challenge, we propose a layer-wise, module-wise, and token-wise amplification framework that progressively magnifies internal feature discrepancies between benign and jailbreak prompts. We uncover safety-relevant layers, identify specific modules that inherently encode zero-shot discriminative signals, and localize informative safety tokens. Building upon these insights, we introduce ALERT (Amplification-based Jailbreak Detector), an efficient and effective zero-shot jailbreak detector that introduces two independent yet complementary classifiers on amplified representations. Extensive experiments on three safety benchmarks demonstrate that ALERT achieves consistently strong zero-shot detection performance. Specifically, (i) across all datasets and attack strategies, ALERT reliably ranks among the top two methods, and (ii) it outperforms the second-best baseline by at least 10% in average Accuracy and F1-score, and sometimes by up to 40%.",

        "abstract": "Recent studies explored integrating state-space search algorithms with Language Models (LM) to perform look-ahead on the token generation process, the ''Tree-of-Thoughts'' (ToT), generated by LMs, thereby improving performance on problem-solving tasks. However, the affiliated search algorithms often overlook the significant computational costs associated with LM inference, particularly in scenarios with constrained computational budgets. Consequently, we address the problem of improving LM performance on problem-solving tasks under limited computational budgets. We demonstrate how the probabilities assigned to thoughts by LMs can serve as a heuristic to guide search within the ToT framework, thereby reducing the number of thought evaluations. Building on this insight, we adapt a heuristic search algorithm, Levin Tree Search (LTS), to the ToT framework, which leverages LMs as policies to guide the tree exploration efficiently. We extend the theoretical results of LTS by showing that, for ToT (a pruned tree), LTS guarantees a bound on the number of states expanded, and consequently, on the number of thoughts generated. Additionally, we analyze the sensitivity of this bound to the temperature values commonly used in the final softmax layer of the LM. Empirical evaluation under a fixed LM query budget demonstrates that LTS consistently achieves comparable or higher accuracy than baseline search algorithms within the ToT framework, across three domains (Blocksworld, PrOntoQA, Array Sorting) and four distinct LMs. These findings highlight the efficacy of LTS on ToT, particularly in enabling cost-effective and time-efficient problem-solving, making it well-suited for latency-critical and resource-constrained applications.",

The model is integrated with a comprehensive feature extraction pipeline and targeted imbalance mitigation strategies. Experiments were conducted on a public respiratory sound database comprising six classes with a highly skewed distribution. Techniques such as focal loss, class-specific data augmentation, and Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) were employed to enhance minority class recognition. The proposed Hybrid LSTM-KAN model achieves an overall accuracy of 94.6 percent and a macro-averaged F1 score of 0.703, despite the dominant COPD class accounting for over 86 percent of the data. Improved detection performance is observed for minority classes compared to baseline approaches, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed architecture for imbalanced respiratory sound classification.",

As a result, synthesizing speech with a desired style often requires carefully selecting reference audio, which is impractical when only limited or mismatched references are available. While recent controllable TTS methods attempt to address this issue, they typically rely on absolute style targets and discrete textual prompts, and therefore do not support continuous and reference-relative style control. We propose ReStyle-TTS, a framework that enables continuous and reference-relative style control in zero-shot TTS. Our key insight is that effective style control requires first reducing the model's implicit dependence on reference style before introducing explicit control mechanisms. To this end, we introduce Decoupled Classifier-Free Guidance (DCFG), which independently controls text and reference guidance, reducing reliance on reference style while preserving text fidelity. On top of this, we apply style-specific LoRAs together with Orthogonal LoRA Fusion to enable continuous and disentangled multi-attribute control, and introduce a Timbre Consistency Optimization module to mitigate timbre drift caused by weakened reference guidance. Experiments show that ReStyle-TTS enables user-friendly, continuous, and relative control over pitch, energy, and multiple emotions while maintaining intelligibility and speaker timbre, and performs robustly in challenging mismatched reference-target style scenarios.",

Existing solutions remain limited by long running time or insufficient schedule quality, especially when problem scale increases. In this paper, we propose ReLA, a reinforcement-learning (RL) scheduler built on structured representation learning and aggregation. ReLA first learns diverse representations from scheduling entities, including job operations and machines, using two intra-entity learning modules with self-attention and convolution and one inter-entity learning module with cross-attention. These modules are applied in a multi-scale architecture, and their outputs are aggregated to support RL decision-making. Across experiments on small, medium, and large job instances, ReLA achieves the best makespan in most tested settings over the latest solutions. On non-large instances, ReLA reduces the optimality gap of the SOTA baseline by 13.0%, while on large-scale instances it reduces the gap by 78.6%, with the average optimality gaps lowered to 7.3% and 2.1%, respectively. These results confirm that ReLA's learned representations and aggregation provide strong decision support for RL scheduling, and enable fast job completion and decision-making for real-world applications.",

A topic of continued interest in both neuroscience and artificial intelligence is whether some neurons behave like grandmother cells, i.e., neurons that are inherently interpretable because they exclusively respond to single concepts. In this work, we propose two information-theoretic measures that quantify the neuronal saliency and selectivity for single concepts. We apply these metrics to the representations of TabPFN, a tabular foundation model, and perform a simple search across neuron-concept pairs to find the most salient and selective pair. Our analysis provides the first evidence that some neurons in such models show moderate, statistically significant saliency and selectivity for high-level concepts. These findings suggest that interpretable neurons can emerge naturally and that they can, in some cases, be identified without resorting to more complex interpretability techniques.",

This method referred to as Group and Exclusive Sparsity based Continual Learning (GESCL) avoids forgetting of previous tasks by ensuring the stability of the CNN via a stability regularization term, which prevents filters detected as important for past tasks to deviate too much when learning a new task. On top of that, GESCL makes the network plastic via a plasticity regularization term that leverage the over-parameterization of CNNs to efficiently sparsify the network and tunes unimportant filters making them relevant for future tasks. Doing so, GESCL deals with significantly less parameters and computation compared to CL approaches that either dynamically expand the network or memorize past tasks' data. Experiments on popular CL vision benchmarks show that GESCL leads to significant improvements over state-of-the-art method in terms of overall CL performance, as measured by classification accuracy as well as in terms of avoiding catastrophic forgetting.",

As a result, valuable supervision from costly rollouts remains underutilized. We propose AMIR-GRPO, which augments GRPO with an implicit DPO-style contrastive regularizer constructed directly from intra-group reward rankings, requiring no additional annotations. This mechanism amplifies suppression of low-reward trajectories, attenuates response-level length bias, and transforms each rollout group into a denser set of supervision constraints.

This work introduces a heteroscedastic Bayesian Physics-Informed Neural Network (B-PINN) framework that jointly models epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty, yielding full predictive posteriors for spatiotemporal insulation material ageing estimation. The approach integrates Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) with physics-based residual enforcement and prior distributions, enabling probabilistic inference within a physics-informed learning architecture. The framework is evaluated on transformer insulation ageing application, validated with a finite-element thermal model and field measurements from a solar power plant, and benchmarked against deterministic PINNs, dropout-based PINNs (d-PINNs), and alternative B-PINN variants. Results show that the proposed B-PINN provides improved predictive accuracy and better-calibrated uncertainty estimates than competing approaches. A systematic sensitivity study further analyzes the impact of boundary-condition, initial-condition, and residual sampling strategies on accuracy, calibration, and generalization.

To address this challenge, we propose STEPS, a Skill Taxonomy guided Entropy-based Post-training data Synthesis framework for generating compositionally challenging data. STEPS explicitly targets compositional generalization by uncovering latent relationships among skills and organizing them into an interpretable, hierarchical skill taxonomy using structural information theory. Building on this taxonomy, we formulate data synthesis as a constrained information maximization problem, selecting skill combinations that maximize marginal structural information within the hierarchy while preserving semantic coherence. Experiments on challenging instruction-following benchmarks show that STEPS outperforms existing data synthesis baselines, while also yielding improved compositional generalization in downstream agent-based evaluations.",

        "abstract": "Recent studies reveal that large language models (LLMs) exhibit limited logical reasoning abilities in mathematical problem-solving, instead often relying on pattern-matching and memorization. We systematically analyze this limitation, focusing on logical relationship understanding, which is a core capability underlying genuine logical reasoning, and reveal that errors related to this capability account for over 90\\% of incorrect predictions, with Chain-of-Thought Supervised Fine-Tuning (CoT-SFT) failing to substantially reduce these errors. To address this bottleneck, we propose First-Step Logical Reasoning (FSLR), a lightweight training framework targeting logical relationship understanding. Our key insight is that the first planning step-identifying which variables to use and which operation to apply-encourages the model to derive logical relationships directly from the problem statement. By training models on this isolated step, FSLR provides explicit supervision for logical relationship understanding, unlike CoT-SFT which implicitly embeds such relationships within complete solution trajectories. Extensive experiments across multiple models and datasets demonstrate that FSLR consistently outperforms CoT-SFT under both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings, with average improvements of 3.2\\% and 4.6\\%, respectively. Moreover, FSLR achieves 4-6x faster training and reduces training token consumption by over 80\\%.",

Combined with dimensionality reduction, RXNEmb enables visualization of reaction space diversity.

        "abstract": "Engineering education faces a double disruption: traditional apprenticeship models that cultivated judgment and tacit skill are eroding, just as generative AI emerges as an informal coaching partner. This convergence rekindles long-standing questions in the philosophy of AI and cognition about the limits of computation, the nature of embodied rationality, and the distinction between information processing and wisdom. Building on this rich intellectual tradition, this paper examines whether AI chatbots can provide coaching that fosters mastery rather than merely delivering information. We synthesize critical perspectives from decades of scholarship on expertise, tacit knowledge, and human-machine interaction, situating them within the context of contemporary AI-driven education. Empirically, we report findings from a mixed-methods study (N = 75 students, N = 7 faculty) exploring the use of a coaching chatbot in engineering education. Results reveal a consistent boundary: participants accept AI for technical problem solving (convergent tasks; M = 3.84 on a 1-5 Likert scale) but remain skeptical of its capacity for moral, emotional, and contextual judgment (divergent tasks). Faculty express stronger concerns over risk (M = 4.71 vs. M = 4.14, p = 0.003), and privacy emerges as a key requirement, with 64-71 percent of participants demanding strict confidentiality. Our findings suggest that while generative AI can democratize access to cognitive and procedural support, it cannot replicate the embodied, value-laden dimensions of human mentorship. We propose a multiplex coaching framework that integrates human wisdom within expert-in-the-loop models, preserving the depth of apprenticeship while leveraging AI scalability to enrich the next generation of engineering education.",

Thus, the Key-Value (KV) cache for skipped layers remains a bottleneck for subsequent token generation, limiting the benefits of early exit. We introduce ADEPT (Adaptive Dynamic Early-exit Process for Transformers), a novel approach designed to overcome this issue and enable dynamic early exit in both the prefill and generation phases. The proposed adaptive token-level early-exit mechanism adjusts computation dynamically based on token complexity, optimizing efficiency without compromising performance. ADEPT further enhances KV generation procedure by decoupling sequential dependencies in skipped layers, making token-level early exit more practical. Experimental results demonstrate that ADEPT improves efficiency by up to 25% in language generation tasks and achieves a 4x speed-up in downstream classification tasks, with up to a 45% improvement in performance.",

First, we design a graph reconstruction attack, which can reconstruct graphs structurally similar to those training graphs from the generated graphs. Second, we propose a property inference attack to infer the properties of the training graphs, such as the average graph density and the distribution of densities, from the generated graphs. Third, we develop two membership inference attacks to determine whether a given graph is present in the training set. Extensive experiments on three different types of graph generative diffusion models and six real-world graphs demonstrate the effectiveness of these attacks, significantly outperforming the baseline approaches. Finally, we propose two defense mechanisms that mitigate these inference attacks and achieve a better trade-off between defense strength and target model utility than existing methods.

However, standard GRPO treats each rollout trajectory as an independent flat sequence and assigns a single sequence-level advantage to all tokens, which leads to sample inefficiency and a length bias toward verbose, redundant chains of thought without improving logical depth. We introduce TreeAdv (Tree-Structured Advantage Redistribution for Group-Based RL), which makes the tree structure of group rollouts explicit for both exploration and advantage assignment. Specifically, TreeAdv builds a group of trees (a forest) based on an entropy-driven sampling method where each tree branches at high-uncertainty decisions while sharing low-uncertainty tokens across rollouts. Then, TreeAdv aggregates token-level advantages for internal tree segments by redistributing the advantages of complete rollouts (all leaf nodes), and TreeAdv can easily apply to group-based objectives such as GRPO or GSPO. Across 10 math reasoning benchmarks, TreeAdv consistently outperforms GRPO and GSPO, while using substantially fewer generated tokens under identical supervision, data, and decoding budgets.",

        "abstract": "The trade-off between predictive accuracy and data availability makes it difficult to predict protein--protein binding affinity accurately. The lack of experimentally resolved protein structures limits the performance of structure-based machine learning models, which generally outperform sequence-based methods. In order to overcome this constraint, we suggest a regression framework based on knowledge distillation that uses protein structural data during training and only needs sequence data during inference. The suggested method uses binding affinity labels and intermediate feature representations to jointly supervise the training of a sequence-based student network under the guidance of a structure-informed teacher network. Leave-One-Complex-Out (LOCO) cross-validation was used to assess the framework on a non-redundant protein--protein binding affinity benchmark dataset. A maximum Pearson correlation coefficient (P_r) of 0.375 and an RMSE of 2.712 kcal/mol were obtained by sequence-only baseline models, whereas a P_r of 0.512 and an RMSE of 2.445 kcal/mol were obtained by structure-based models. With a P_r of 0.481 and an RMSE of 2.488 kcal/mol, the distillation-based student model greatly enhanced sequence-only performance. Improved agreement and decreased bias were further confirmed by thorough error analyses. With the potential to close the performance gap between sequence-based and structure-based models as larger datasets become available, these findings show that knowledge distillation is an efficient method for transferring structural knowledge to sequence-based predictors.

Exploration suffers from low success rates on difficult tasks and high costs of repeated rollouts from scratch. Exploitation suffers from coarse credit assignment and training instability: Trajectory-level rewards penalize valid prefixes for later errors, and failure-dominated groups overwhelm the few positive signals, leaving optimization without constructive direction. To this end, we propose R$^3$L, Reflect-then-Retry Reinforcement Learning with Language-Guided Exploration, Pivotal Credit, and Positive Amplification. To synthesize high-quality trajectories, R$^3$L shifts from stochastic sampling to active synthesis via reflect-then-retry, leveraging language feedback to diagnose errors, transform failed attempts into successful ones, and reduce rollout costs by restarting from identified failure points. With errors diagnosed and localized, Pivotal Credit Assignment updates only the diverging suffix where contrastive signals exist, excluding the shared prefix from gradient update. Since failures dominate on difficult tasks and reflect-then-retry produces off-policy data, risking training instability, Positive Amplification upweights successful trajectories to ensure positive signals guide the optimization process. Experiments on agentic and reasoning tasks demonstrate 5\\% to 52\\% relative improvements over baselines while maintaining training stability. Our code is released at this https URL.",

To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel framework for the automated synthesis of sophisticated, research-grade instructional data. Our approach centers on a multi-agent workflow where collaborative AI agents simulate complex tool-integrated reasoning to generate diverse and high-fidelity data end-to-end. Leveraging this synthesized data, we develop a two-stage training strategy that integrates supervised fine-tuning with a novel reinforcement learning method, designed to maximize model alignment and capability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework empowers open-source models across multiple scales, enabling them to achieve new state-of-the-art performance on the major deep research benchmark.

        "abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are increasingly deployed on large-scale document collections, often comprising millions of documents and tens of millions of text chunks. In industrial-scale retrieval platforms, scalability is typically addressed through horizontal sharding and a combination of Approximate Nearest-Neighbor search, hybrid indexing, and optimized metadata filtering. Although effective from an efficiency perspective, these mechanisms rely on bottom-up, similarity-driven organization and lack a conceptual rationale for corpus partitioning. In this paper, we claim that the design of large-scale RAG systems may benefit from the combination of two orthogonal strategies: semantic clustering, which optimizes locality in embedding space, and multidimensional partitioning, which governs where retrieval should occur based on conceptual dimensions such as time and organizational context. Although such dimensions are already implicitly present in current systems, they are used in an ad hoc and poorly structured manner. We propose the Dimensional Fact Model (DFM) as a conceptual framework to guide the design of multidimensional partitions for RAG corpora. The DFM provides a principled way to reason about facts, dimensions, hierarchies, and granularity in retrieval-oriented settings. This framework naturally supports hierarchical routing and controlled fallback strategies, ensuring that retrieval remains robust even in the presence of incomplete metadata, while transforming the search process from a 'black-box' similarity matching into a governable and deterministic workflow. This work is intended as a position paper; its goal is to bridge the gap between OLAP-style multidimensional modeling and modern RAG architectures, and to stimulate further research on principled, explainable, and governable retrieval strategies at scale.",

In this work, we examine this phenomenon across 10 languages, while we focus not only on potential misuse of personalization capabilities, but also on potential benefits they offer. Overall, we cover 1080 combinations of various personalization aspects in the prompts, for which the texts are generated by 16 distinct language models (17,280 texts in total). Our results indicate that there are differences in personalization quality of the generated texts when targeting demographic groups and when targeting social-media platforms across languages. Personalization towards platforms affects detectability of the generated texts in a higher scale, especially in English, where the personalization quality is the highest.",

In our Latent Instance Difficulty (LID) model, each input's target variance is governed by a latent ``precision'' drawn from a heavy-tailed distribution. While generalization loss recovers standard scaling laws, our main contribution connects this to inference. The pass@$k$ failure rate exhibits a power-law decay, $k^{-\\beta_\\text{eff}}$, but the observed exponent $\\beta_\\text{eff}$ is training-dependent. It grows with sample size $N$ before saturating at an intrinsic limit $\\beta$ set by the difficulty distribution's tail. This coupling reveals that learning shrinks the ``hard tail'' of the error distribution: improvements in the model's generalization error steepen the pass@$k$ curve until irreducible target variance dominates. The LID model yields testable, closed-form predictions for this behavior, including a compute-allocation rule that favors training before saturation and inference attempts after. We validate these predictions in simulations and in two real-data proxies: CIFAR-10H (human-label variance) and a maths teacher-student distillation task.",

Crucially, its efficient design provides up to 30% speedup compared to purely local models.

Existing designs follow a fragmentation-compensation paradigm: they first break dialogue streams into isolated utterances for storage, then attempt to restore coherence via embedding-based retrieval. This process irreversibly damages narrative and causal flow, while biasing retrieval towards lexical similarity. We introduce membox, a hierarchical memory architecture centered on a Topic Loom that continuously monitors dialogue in a sliding-window fashion, grouping consecutive same-topic turns into coherent \"memory boxes\" at storage time. Sealed boxes are then linked by a Trace Weaver into long-range event-timeline traces, recovering macro-topic recurrences across discontinuities. Experiments on LoCoMo demonstrate that Membox achieves up to 68% F1 improvement on temporal reasoning tasks, outperforming competitive baselines (e.g., Mem0, A-MEM). Notably, Membox attains these gains while using only a fraction of the context tokens required by existing methods, highlighting a superior balance between efficiency and effectiveness. By explicitly modeling topic continuity, Membox offers a cognitively motivated mechanism for enhancing both coherence and efficiency in LLM agents.",

The new dataset covers 16 languages and 75 translation directions and is derived from approximately 10 million records of an English Wiktionary dump. The retrieval corpus of the search tool is also constructed from around 3 million cleaned records of the Wiktionary dump. We then use it for training the translation agent with reinforcement learning (RL) and evaluating the accuracy of neologism-aware machine translation.

We propose a principled revision of memorization evaluation for LLMs, arguing that PII leakage should be evaluated under low lexical cue conditions, where target PII cannot be reconstructed through prompt-induced generalization or pattern completion. We formalize Cue-Resistant Memorization (CRM) as a cue-controlled evaluation framework and a necessary condition for valid memorization evaluation, explicitly conditioning on prompt-target overlap cues. Using CRM, we conduct a large-scale multilingual re-evaluation of PII leakage across 32 languages and multiple memorization paradigms. Revisiting reconstruction-based settings, including verbatim prefix-suffix completion and associative reconstruction, we find that their apparent effectiveness is driven primarily by direct surface-form cues rather than by true memorization. When such cues are controlled for, reconstruction success diminishes substantially. We further examine cue-free generation and membership inference, both of which exhibit extremely low true positive rates. Overall, our results suggest that previously reported PII leakage is better explained by cue-driven behavior than by genuine memorization, highlighting the importance of cue-controlled evaluation for reliably quantifying privacy-relevant memorization in LLMs.",

The framework is applied to a case study focused on financial narratives, an emerging area in financial economics that examines how structured accounts of economic events, formed by the convergence of individual interpretations, influence market dynamics and asset prices. Drawing from the Scopus database of peer-reviewed literature, the review highlights research efforts to model financial narratives using various NLP techniques. Results reveal that while advances have been made, the conceptualization of financial narratives remains fragmented, often reduced to sentiment analysis, topic modeling, or their combination, without a unified theoretical framework.

We conduct a systematic layer-wise probing study of 58 psycholinguistic features across 10 transformer models, spanning encoder-only and decoder-only architectures, and compare three embedding extraction methods. We find that apparent localization of meaning is strongly method-dependent: contextualized embeddings yield higher feature-specific selectivity and different layer-wise profiles than isolated embeddings. Across models and methods, final-layer representations are rarely optimal for recovering psycholinguistic information with linear probes. Despite these differences, models exhibit a shared depth ordering of meaning dimensions, with lexical properties peaking earlier and experiential and affective dimensions peaking later. Together, these results show that where meaning \"lives\" in transformer models reflects an interaction between methodological choices and architectural constraints.",

This paper presents an evaluation of AI text detection methods, including both traditional machine learning models and transformer-based architectures. We utilize two datasets, HC3 and DAIGT v2, to build a unified benchmark and apply a topic-based data split to prevent information leakage. This approach ensures robust generalization across unseen domains. Our experiments show that TF-IDF logistic regression achieves a reasonable baseline accuracy of 82.87%.

The results indicate that contextual semantic modeling is significantly superior to lexical features and highlight the importance of mitigating topic memorization through appropriate evaluation protocols. The limitations of this work are primarily related to dataset diversity and computational constraints.

        "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce Logic Tensor Network-Enhanced Generative Adversarial Network (LTN-GAN), a novel framework that enhances Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) by incorporating Logic Tensor Networks (LTNs) to enforce domain-specific logical constraints during the sample generation process. Although GANs have shown remarkable success in generating realistic data, they often lack mechanisms to incorporate prior knowledge or enforce logical consistency, limiting their applicability in domains requiring rule adherence. LTNs provide a principled way to integrate first-order logic with neural networks, enabling models to reason over and satisfy logical constraints. By combining the strengths of GANs for realistic data synthesis with LTNs for logical reasoning, we gain valuable insights into how logical constraints influence the generative process while improving both the diversity and logical consistency of the generated samples. We evaluate LTN-GAN across multiple datasets, including synthetic datasets (gaussian, grid, rings) and the MNIST dataset, demonstrating that our model significantly outperforms traditional GANs in terms of adherence to predefined logical constraints while maintaining the quality and diversity of generated samples. This work highlights the potential of neuro-symbolic approaches to enhance generative modeling in knowledge-intensive domains.",

        "abstract": "The logical semantics of normal logic programs has traditionally been based on the notions of Clark's completion and two-valued or three-valued canonical models, including supported, stable, regular, and well-founded models. Two-valued interpretations can also be seen as states evolving under a program's update operator, producing a transition graph whose fixed points and cycles capture stable and oscillatory behaviors, respectively. We refer to this view as dynamical semantics since it characterizes the program's meaning in terms of state-space trajectories, as first introduced in the stable (supported) class semantics. Recently, we have established a formal connection between Datalog^\\neg programs (i.e., normal logic programs without function symbols) and Boolean networks, leading to the introduction of the trap space concept for Datalog^\\neg programs. In this paper, we generalize the trap space concept to arbitrary normal logic programs, introducing trap space semantics as a new approach to their interpretation. This new semantics admits both model-theoretic and dynamical characterizations, providing a comprehensive approach to understanding program behavior. We establish the foundational properties of the trap space semantics and systematically relate it to the established model-theoretic semantics, including the stable (supported), stable (supported) partial, regular, and L-stable model semantics, as well as to the dynamical stable (supported) class semantics. Our results demonstrate that the trap space semantics offers a unified and precise framework for proving the existence of supported classes, strict stable (supported) classes, and regular models, in addition to uncovering and formalizing deeper relationships among the existing semantics of normal logic programs.",

We analyse interactions across four canonical game-theoretic settings under different communication regimes, including explicit, restricted, and absent communication.

        "abstract": "This paper presents a comprehensive empirical study on the safety alignment capabilities. We evaluate what matters for safety alignment in LLMs and LRMs to provide essential insights for developing more secure and reliable AI systems. We systematically investigate and compare the influence of six critical intrinsic model characteristics and three external attack techniques. Our large-scale evaluation is conducted using 32 recent, popular LLMs and LRMs across thirteen distinct model families, spanning a parameter scale from 3B to 235B. The assessment leverages five established safety datasets and probes model vulnerabilities with 56 jailbreak techniques and four CoT attack strategies, resulting in 4.6M API calls. Our key empirical findings are fourfold. First, we identify the LRMs GPT-OSS-20B, Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Thinking, and GPT-OSS-120B as the top-three safest models, which substantiates the significant advantage of integrated reasoning and self-reflection mechanisms for robust safety alignment. Second, post-training and knowledge distillation may lead to a systematic degradation of safety alignment. We thus argue that safety must be treated as an explicit constraint or a core optimization objective during these stages, not merely subordinated to the pursuit of general capability. Third, we reveal a pronounced vulnerability: employing a CoT attack via a response prefix can elevate the attack success rate by 3.34x on average and from 0.6% to 96.3% for Seed-OSS-36B-Instruct. This critical finding underscores the safety risks inherent in text-completion interfaces and features that allow user-defined response prefixes in LLM services, highlighting an urgent need for architectural and deployment safeguards. Fourth, roleplay, prompt injection, and gradient-based search for adversarial prompts are the predominant methodologies for eliciting unaligned behaviors in modern models.",

Using nationally representative UK survey data from 2023 to 2024, we show that women adopt GenAI substantially less often than men because they perceive its societal risks differently. We construct a composite index capturing concerns about mental health, privacy, climate impact, and labor market disruption. This index explains between 9 and 18 percent of the variation in GenAI adoption and ranks among the strongest predictors for women across all age groups, surpassing digital literacy and education for young women. Intersectional analyses show that the largest disparities arise among younger, digitally fluent individuals with high societal risk concerns, where gender gaps in personal use exceed 45 percentage points. Using a synthetic twin panel design, we show that increased optimism about AI's societal impact raises GenAI use among young women from 13 percent to 33 percent, substantially narrowing the gender divide. These findings indicate that gendered perceptions of AI's social and ethical consequences, rather than access or capability, are the primary drivers of unequal GenAI adoption, with implications for productivity, skill formation, and economic inequality in an AI enabled economy.",

Building upon this, we present IndexTTS 2.5, which significantly enhances multilingual coverage, inference speed, and overall synthesis quality through four key improvements: 1) Semantic Codec Compression: we reduce the semantic codec frame rate from 50 Hz to 25 Hz, halving sequence length and substantially lowering both training and inference costs; 2) Architectural Upgrade: we replace the U-DiT-based backbone of the S2M module with a more efficient Zipformer-based modeling architecture, achieving notable parameter reduction and faster mel-spectrogram generation; 3) Multilingual Extension: We propose three explicit cross-lingual modeling strategies, boundary-aware alignment, token-level concatenation, and instruction-guided generation, establishing practical design principles for zero-shot multilingual emotional TTS that supports Chinese, English, Japanese, and Spanish, and enables robust emotion transfer even without target-language emotional training data; 4) Reinforcement Learning Optimization: we apply GRPO in post-training of the T2S module, improving pronunciation accuracy and natrualness. Experiments show that IndexTTS 2.5 not only supports broader language coverage but also replicates emotional prosody in unseen languages under the same zero-shot setting. IndexTTS 2.5 achieves a 2.28 times improvement in RTF while maintaining comparable WER and speaker similarity to IndexTTS 2.",

Our method uses dual regularization: spectral norm constraints bound routing function Lipschitz continuity, while stable rank penalties preserve high-dimensional feature diversity in expert selection. We evaluate SR-MoE across architectural scales and dataset complexities using modular one-shot adaptation tasks. Results show that traditional linear gating fails with increasing depth (accuracy drops up to 4.72% due to expert entanglement), while SR-MoE maintains structural integrity (mean interference -0.32%). Our spectral constraints facilitate positive knowledge transfer, enabling localized expert updates without global performance decay.

Within this framework, Group Equivariant Non-Expansive Operators (GENEOs) have emerged as a powerful class of operators for encoding symmetries and designing efficient, interpretable neural architectures. Originally introduced in Topological Data Analysis, GENEOs have since found applications in Deep Learning as tools for constructing equivariant models with reduced parameter complexity. GENEOs provide a unifying framework bridging Geometric and Topological Deep Learning and include the operator computing persistence diagrams as a special case. Their theoretical foundations rely on group actions, equivariance, and compactness properties of operator spaces, grounding them in algebra and geometry while enabling both mathematical rigor and practical relevance. While a previous representation theorem characterized linear GENEOs acting on data of the same type, many real-world applications require operators between heterogeneous data spaces. In this work, we address this limitation by introducing a new representation theorem for linear GENEOs acting between different perception pairs, based on generalized T-permutant measures. Under mild assumptions on the data domains and group actions, our result provides a complete characterization of such operators. We also prove the compactness and convexity of the space of linear GENEOs. We further demonstrate the practical impact of this theory by applying the proposed framework to improve the performance of autoencoders, highlighting the relevance of GENEOs in modern machine learning applications.",

Decision trees induce rule-based, axis-aligned decision regions (finite unions of boxes), whereas shallow ReLU networks are typically trained as score models whose predictions are obtained by thresholding. We analyze the infinite-width, bounded-norm, single-hidden-layer ReLU class through the Radon total variation ($\\mathrm{R}\\mathrm{TV}$) seminorm, which controls the geometric complexity of level sets. We first show that the hard tree indicator $1_A$ has infinite $\\mathrm{R}\\mathrm{TV}$. Moreover, two natural split-wise continuous surrogates--piecewise-linear ramp smoothing and sigmoidal (logistic) smoothing--also have infinite $\\mathrm{R}\\mathrm{TV}$ in dimensions $d>1$, while Gaussian convolution yields finite $\\mathrm{R}\\mathrm{TV}$ but with an explicit exponential dependence on $d$. We then separate two goals that are often conflated: classification after thresholding (recovering the decision set) versus score learning (learning a calibrated score close to $1_A$). For classification, we construct a smooth barrier score $S_A$ with finite $\\mathrm{R}\\mathrm{TV}$ whose fixed threshold $\\tau=1$ exactly recovers the box. Under a mild tube-mass condition near $\\partial A$, we prove an $L_1(P)$ calibration bound that decays polynomially in a sharpness parameter, along with an explicit $\\mathrm{R}\\mathrm{TV}$ upper bound in terms of face measures. Experiments on synthetic unions of rectangles illustrate the resulting accuracy--complexity tradeoff and how threshold selection shifts where training lands along it.",

Memory replay methods are widely used for their practicality and effectiveness, but most rely on fixed, step-based heuristics that often misalign with the model's actual learning progress, since identical training steps can result in varying degrees of parameter change. Motivated by recent findings that LLM forgetting mirrors the Ebbinghaus human forgetting curve, we propose FOREVER (FORgEtting curVe-inspired mEmory Replay), a novel CL framework that aligns replay schedules with a model-centric notion of time. FOREVER defines model time using the magnitude of optimizer updates, allowing forgetting curve-inspired replay intervals to align with the model's internal evolution rather than raw training steps. Building on this approach, FOREVER incorporates a forgetting curve-based replay scheduler to determine when to replay and an intensity-aware regularization mechanism to adaptively control how to replay. Extensive experiments on three CL benchmarks and models ranging from 0.6B to 13B parameters demonstrate that FOREVER consistently mitigates catastrophic forgetting.",

        "abstract": "Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models facilitate edge deployment by decoupling model capacity from active computation, yet their large memory footprint drives the need for GPU systems with near-data processing (NDP) capabilities that offload experts to dedicated processing units. However, deploying MoE models on such edge-based GPU-NDP systems faces three critical challenges: 1) severe load imbalance across NDP units due to non-uniform expert selection and expert parallelism, 2) insufficient GPU utilization during expert computation within NDP units, and 3) extensive data pre-profiling necessitated by unpredictable expert activation patterns for pre-fetching. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an efficient inference framework featuring three key optimizations. First, the underexplored tensor parallelism in MoE inference is exploited to partition and compute large expert parameters across multiple NDP units simultaneously towards edge low-batch scenarios. Second, a load-balancing-aware scheduling algorithm distributes expert computations across NDP units and GPU to maximize resource utilization. Third, a dataset-free pre-fetching strategy proactively loads frequently accessed experts to minimize activation delays. Experimental results show that our framework enables GPU-NDP systems to achieve 2.41x on average and up to 2.56x speedup in end-to-end latency compared to state-of-the-art approaches, significantly enhancing MoE inference efficiency in resource-constrained environments.",

However, existing reactive defense approaches struggle to keep up with the rapidly evolving multi-turn jailbreaks, where attackers continuously deepen their attacks to exploit vulnerabilities. To address this critical challenge, we propose HoneyTrap, a novel deceptive LLM defense framework leveraging collaborative defenders to counter jailbreak attacks. It integrates four defensive agents, Threat Interceptor, Misdirection Controller, Forensic Tracker, and System Harmonizer, each performing a specialized security role and collaborating to complete a deceptive defense. To ensure a comprehensive evaluation, we introduce MTJ-Pro, a challenging multi-turn progressive jailbreak dataset that combines seven advanced jailbreak strategies designed to gradually deepen attack strategies across multi-turn attacks. Besides, we present two novel metrics: Mislead Success Rate (MSR) and Attack Resource Consumption (ARC), which provide more nuanced assessments of deceptive defense beyond conventional measures. Experimental results on GPT-4, GPT-3.5-turbo, Gemini-1.5-pro, and LLaMa-3.1 demonstrate that HoneyTrap achieves an average reduction of 68.77% in attack success rates compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Notably, even in a dedicated adaptive attacker setting with intensified conditions, HoneyTrap remains resilient, leveraging deceptive engagement to prolong interactions, significantly increasing the time and computational costs required for successful exploitation. Unlike simple rejection, HoneyTrap strategically wastes attacker resources without impacting benign queries, improving MSR and ARC by 118.11% and 149.16%, respectively.",

However, the robustness of their reasoning chains remains questionable. In this paper, we identify a critical failure mode termed textual inertia, where once a textual hallucination occurs in the thinking process, models tend to blindly adhere to the erroneous text while neglecting conflicting visual evidence. To systematically investigate this, we propose the LogicGraph Perturbation Protocol that structurally injects perturbations into the reasoning chains of diverse LMMs spanning both native reasoning architectures and prompt-driven paradigms to evaluate their self-reflection capabilities. The results reveal that models successfully self-correct in less than 10% of cases and predominantly succumb to blind textual error propagation. To mitigate this, we introduce Active Visual-Context Refinement, a training-free inference paradigm which orchestrates an active visual re-grounding mechanism to enforce fine-grained verification coupled with an adaptive context refinement strategy to summarize and denoise the reasoning history. Experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly stifles hallucination propagation and enhances reasoning robustness.",

While positional bias has been studied in various contexts, from attention sinks to task performance degradation in long-context settings, prior work has not established how these biases evolve across individual layers and input positions, or how they vary independent of task complexity. We introduce an attribution-based framework to analyze positional effects in short-context language modeling. Using layer conductance with a sliding-window approach, we quantify how each layer distributes importance across input positions, yielding layer-wise positional importance profiles. We find that these profiles are architecture-specific, stable across inputs, and invariant to lexical scrambling. Characterizing these profiles, we find prominent recency bias that increases with depth and subtle primacy bias that diminishes through model depth. Beyond positional structure, we also show that early layers preferentially weight content words over function words across all positions, while later layers lose this word-type differentiation.",

While modular frameworks enable users to automatically generate and configure algorithms tailored to specific optimization problems, the complexity of this process increases with the number of modules in the framework and the degrees of freedom defined for their interaction. Understanding how modules affect the performance of algorithms for different problems is critical to making the process of finding effective implementations more efficient and identifying promising areas for further investigation. Despite their practical applications and scientific relevance, there is a lack of empirical studies investigating which modules matter most in modular optimization frameworks and how they interact. In this paper, we analyze the performance of 1424 particle swarm optimization algorithms instantiated from the PSO-X framework on the 25 functions in the CEC'05 benchmark suite with 10 and 30 dimensions. We use functional ANOVA to quantify the impact of modules and their combinations on performance in different problem classes. In practice, this allows us to identify which modules have greater influence on PSO-X performance depending on problem features such as multimodality, mathematical transformations and varying dimensionality. We then perform a cluster analysis to identify groups of problem classes that share similar module effect patterns. Our results show low variability in the importance of modules in all problem classes, suggesting that particle swarm optimization performance is driven by a few influential modules.",

In this study, we propose a novel multimodal approach that leverages pixel-wise two-dimensional (2D) representations to encode visual property variations from SITS more effectively. Specifically, we generate recurrence plots from pixel-based vegetation index time series (NDVI, EVI, and SAVI) as an alternative to using raw pixel values, creating more informative representations. Additionally, we introduce PIxel-wise Multimodal Contrastive (PIMC), a new multimodal self-supervision approach that produces effective encoders based on two-dimensional pixel time series representations and remote sensing imagery (RSI). To validate our approach, we assess its performance on three downstream tasks: pixel-level forecasting and classification using the PASTIS dataset, and land cover classification on the EuroSAT dataset. Moreover, we compare our results to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on all downstream tasks. Our experimental results show that the use of 2D representations significantly enhances feature extraction from SITS, while contrastive learning improves the quality of representations for both pixel time series and RSI. These findings suggest that our multimodal method outperforms existing models in various Earth observation tasks, establishing it as a robust self-supervision framework for processing both SITS and RSI.

In this work, we introduce ContextFocus, a lightweight activation steering approach that improves context faithfulness in such knowledge-conflict settings while preserving fluency and efficiency. Unlike prior approaches, our solution requires no model finetuning and incurs minimal inference-time overhead, making it highly efficient. We evaluate ContextFocus on the ConFiQA benchmark, comparing it against strong baselines including ContextDPO, COIECD, and prompting-based methods. Furthermore, we show that our method is complementary to prompting strategies and remains effective on larger models.

Non-commercial approaches still suffer audio-visual asynchrony, poor lip-speech alignment, and unimodal degradation, which can be stemmed from weak audio-visual correspondence modeling, limited generalization, and scarce high-quality dense-caption data. To address these issues, we introduce Klear and delve into three axes--model architecture, training strategy, and data curation. Architecturally, we adopt a single-tower design with unified DiT blocks and an Omni-Full Attention mechanism, achieving tight audio-visual alignment and strong scalability. Training-wise, we adopt a progressive multitask regime--random modality masking to joint optimization across tasks, and a multistage curriculum, yielding robust representations, strengthening A-V aligned world knowledge, and preventing unimodal collapse. For datasets, we present the first large-scale audio-video dataset with dense captions, and introduce a novel automated data-construction pipeline which annotates and filters millions of diverse, high-quality, strictly aligned audio-video-caption triplets. Building on this, Klear scales to large datasets, delivering high-fidelity, semantically and temporally aligned, instruction-following generation in both joint and unimodal settings while generalizing robustly to out-of-distribution scenarios. Across tasks, it substantially outperforms prior methods by a large margin and achieves performance comparable to Veo 3, offering a unified, scalable path toward next-generation audio-video synthesis.",

The Medical Event Data Standard (MEDS) addresses these issues by introducing a minimal, event-centric data model designed for reproducible machine-learning workflows from health data. However, MEDS is defined as a data-format specification and does not natively provide integration with the Semantic Web ecosystem. In this article, we introduce MEDS-OWL, a lightweight OWL ontology that provides formal concepts and relations to enable representing MEDS datasets as RDF graphs. Additionally, we implemented meds2rdf, a Python conversion library that transforms MEDS events into RDF graphs, ensuring conformance with the ontology. We demonstrate the approach on a synthetic clinical dataset that describes patient care pathways for ruptured intracranial aneurysms and validate the resulting graph using SHACL constraints. The first release of MEDS-OWL comprises 13 classes, 10 object properties, 20 data properties, and 24 OWL axioms. Combined with meds2rdf, it enables data transformation into FAIR-aligned datasets, provenance-aware publishing, and interoperability of event-based clinical data.

        "abstract": "Many embedded devices operate under resource constraints and in dynamic environments, requiring local decision-making capabilities. Enabling devices to make independent decisions in such environments can improve the responsiveness of the system and reduce the dependence on constant external control. In this work, we integrate an autonomous agent, programmed using AgentSpeak, with a small two-wheeled robot that explores a maze using its own decision-making and sensor data. Experimental results show that the agent successfully solved the maze in 59 seconds using 287 reasoning cycles, with decision phases taking less than one millisecond. These results indicate that the reasoning process is efficient enough for real-time execution on resource-constrained hardware. This integration demonstrates how high-level agent-based control can be applied to resource-constrained embedded systems for autonomous operation.",
