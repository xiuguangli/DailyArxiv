        "abstract": "Unlike conventional Machine-Learning (ML) approaches, often criticized as \"black boxes\", Symbolic Regression (SR) stands out as a powerful tool for revealing interpretable mathematical relationships in complex physical systems, requiring no a priori assumptions about models' structures. Motivated by the recognition that, in fluid mechanics, an understanding of the underlying flow physics is as crucial as accurate prediction, this study applies SR to model a fundamental three-dimensional (3D) incompressible flow in a rectangular channel, focusing on the (axial) velocity and pressure fields under laminar conditions. By employing the PySR library, compact symbolic equations were derived directly from numerical simulation data, revealing key characteristics of the flow dynamics. These equations not only approximate the parabolic velocity profile and pressure drop observed in the studied fluid flow, but also perfectly coincide with analytical solutions from the literature. Furthermore, we propose an innovative approach that integrates SR with the knowledge-representation framework of Answer Set Programming (ASP), combining the generative power of SR with the declarative reasoning strengths of ASP. The proposed hybrid SR/ASP framework ensures that the SR-generated symbolic expressions are not only statistically accurate, but also physically plausible, adhering to domain-specific principles. Overall, the study highlights two key contributions: SR's ability to simplify complex flow behaviours into concise, interpretable equations, and the potential of knowledge-representation approaches to improve the reliability and alignment of data-driven SR models with domain principles. Insights from the examined 3D channel flow pave the way for integrating such hybrid approaches into efficient frameworks, [...] where explainable predictions and real-time data analysis are crucial.",

While these systems effectively manage tasks like query translation, data transformation, and visualization, they often overlook the structured reasoning process underlying analytical thinking. Reasoning large language models (LLMs) used for multi-step problem solving are trained as general-purpose problem solvers. As a result, their reasoning or thinking steps do not adhere to fixed processes for specific tasks. Real-world data analysis requires a consistent cognitive workflow: interpreting vague goals, grounding them in contextual knowledge, constructing abstract plans, and adapting execution based on intermediate outcomes. We introduce I2I-STRADA (Information-to-Insight via Structured Reasoning Agent for Data Analysis), an agentic architecture designed to formalize this reasoning process. I2I-STRADA focuses on modeling how analysis unfolds via modular sub-tasks that reflect the cognitive steps of analytical reasoning. Evaluations on the DABstep and DABench benchmarks show that I2I-STRADA outperforms prior systems in planning coherence and insight alignment, highlighting the importance of structured cognitive workflows in agent design for data analysis.",

However, nondeterministic automata cannot be directly used to synthesize planning strategies as a costly determinization step is needed. In this paper, we identify a fragment of qualitative timeline-based planning whose plan-existence problem can be directly mapped into the nonemptiness problem of deterministic finite automata, which can then synthesize strategies.

This paper proposes the E.A.R.T.H. framework, a five-stage generative pipeline that transforms model-generated errors into creative assets through Error generation, Amplification, Refine selection, Transform, and Harness feedback. Drawing on cognitive science and generative modeling, we posit that \"creative potential hides in failure\" and operationalize this via structured prompts, semantic scoring, and human-in-the-loop evaluation. Implemented using LLaMA-2-7B-Chat, SBERT, BERTScore, CLIP, BLIP-2, and Stable Diffusion, the pipeline employs a composite reward function based on novelty, surprise, and relevance. At the Refine stage, creativity scores increase by 52.5% (1.179 to 1.898, t = -5.56, p < 0.001), with final outputs reaching 2.010 - a 70.4% improvement. Refined slogans are 48.4% shorter, 40.7% more novel, with only a 4.0% drop in relevance. Cross-modal tests show strong slogan-to-image alignment (CLIPScore: 0.249; BERTScore F1: 0.816). In human evaluations, 60% of outputs scored >= 4.0, with metaphorical slogans (avg. 4.09) outperforming literal ones (3.99). Feedback highlights stylistic precision and emotional resonance. These results demonstrate that error-centered, feedback-driven generation enhances creativity, offering a scalable path toward self-evolving, human-aligned creative AI.",

We provide theoretical guarantees of monotonic policy improvement and empirically evaluate MAGPO on 43 tasks across 6 diverse environments. Results show that MAGPO consistently outperforms strong CTDE baselines and matches or surpasses fully centralized approaches, offering a principled and practical solution for decentralized multi-agent learning.

We present ASI-Arch, the first demonstration of Artificial Superintelligence for AI research (ASI4AI) in the critical domain of neural architecture discovery--a fully autonomous system that shatters this fundamental constraint by enabling AI to conduct its own architectural innovation. Moving beyond traditional Neural Architecture Search (NAS), which is fundamentally limited to exploring human-defined spaces, we introduce a paradigm shift from automated optimization to automated innovation. ASI-Arch can conduct end-to-end scientific research in the domain of architecture discovery, autonomously hypothesizing novel architectural concepts, implementing them as executable code, training and empirically validating their performance through rigorous experimentation and past experience. ASI-Arch conducted 1,773 autonomous experiments over 20,000 GPU hours, culminating in the discovery of 106 innovative, state-of-the-art (SOTA) linear attention architectures. Like AlphaGo's Move 37 that revealed unexpected strategic insights invisible to human players, our AI-discovered architectures demonstrate emergent design principles that systematically surpass human-designed baselines and illuminate previously unknown pathways for architectural innovation. Crucially, we establish the first empirical scaling law for scientific discovery itself--demonstrating that architectural breakthroughs can be scaled computationally, transforming research progress from a human-limited to a computation-scalable process. We provide comprehensive analysis of the emergent design patterns and autonomous research capabilities that enabled these breakthroughs, establishing a blueprint for self-accelerating AI systems.",

        "abstract": "Building and deploying machine learning solutions in healthcare remains expensive and labor-intensive due to fragmented preprocessing workflows, model compatibility issues, and stringent data privacy constraints. In this work, we introduce an Agentic AI framework that automates the entire clinical data pipeline, from ingestion to inference, through a system of modular, task-specific agents. These agents handle both structured and unstructured data, enabling automatic feature selection, model selection, and preprocessing recommendation without manual intervention. We evaluate the system on publicly available datasets from geriatrics, palliative care, and colonoscopy imaging. For example, in the case of structured data (anxiety data) and unstructured data (colonoscopy polyps data), the pipeline begins with file-type detection by the Ingestion Identifier Agent, followed by the Data Anonymizer Agent ensuring privacy compliance, where we first identify the data type and then anonymize it. The Feature Extraction Agent identifies features using an embedding-based approach for tabular data, extracting all column names, and a multi-stage MedGemma-based approach for image data, which infers modality and disease name. These features guide the Model-Data Feature Matcher Agent in selecting the best-fit model from a curated repository. The Preprocessing Recommender Agent and Preprocessing Implementor Agent then apply tailored preprocessing based on data type and model requirements. Finally, the ``Model Inference Agent\" runs the selected model on the uploaded data and generates interpretable outputs using tools like SHAP, LIME, and DETR attention maps. By automating these high-friction stages of the ML lifecycle, the proposed framework reduces the need for repeated expert intervention, offering a scalable, cost-efficient pathway for operationalizing AI in clinical environments.",

ED triage notes, containing expert, succinct vital patient information at the point of entry to health systems, can significantly contribute to timely vaccine safety signal surveillance. While keyword-based classification can be effective, it may yield false positives and demand extensive keyword modifications.

The non-uniform expressive power of mean GNNs is thus higher than that of GNNs with max aggregation, but lower than for sum aggregation--the latter are characterized by modal logic and graded modal logic, respectively. In the uniform setting, we show that the expressive power relative to MSO is exactly that of alternation-free modal logic, under the natural assumptions that combination functions are continuous and classification functions are thresholds. This implies that, relative to MSO and in the uniform setting, mean GNNs are strictly less expressive than sum GNNs and max GNNs.

Inspired by dual-system cognitive theory, we propose a cognition attribution framework to decouple the contribution of knowledge and reasoning. In particular, the cognition of LLMs is decomposed into two distinct yet complementary phases: knowledge retrieval (Phase 1) and reasoning adjustment (Phase 2). To separate these phases, LLMs are prompted to generate answers under two different cognitive modes, fast thinking and slow thinking, respectively. The performance under different cognitive modes is analyzed to quantify the contribution of knowledge and reasoning. This architecture is employed to 15 LLMs across 3 datasets. Results reveal: (1) reasoning adjustment is domain-specific, benefiting reasoning-intensive domains (e.g., mathematics, physics, and chemistry) and potentially imparing knowledge-intensive domains. (2) Parameter scaling improves both knowledge and reasoning, with knowledge improvements being more pronounced. Additionally, parameter scaling make LLMs reasoning significantly more prudent, while moderately more intelligent. (3) Knowledge primarily resides in lower network layers, while reasoning operates in higher layers. Our framework not only helps understand LLMs from a \"decoupling\" perspective, but also provides new insights into existing research, including scaling laws, hierarchical knowledge editing, and limitations of small-model reasoning.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we compare four different semantics for disjunction in Answer Set Programming that, unlike stable models, do not adhere to the principle of model minimality. Two of these approaches, Cabalar and Muñiz' \\emph{Justified Models} and Doherty and Szalas' \\emph{Strongly Supported Models}, directly provide an alternative non-minimal semantics for disjunction. The other two, Aguado et al's \\emph{Forks} and Shen and Eiter's \\emph{Determining Inference} (DI) semantics, actually introduce a new disjunction connective, but are compared here as if they constituted new semantics for the standard disjunction operator. We are able to prove that three of these approaches (Forks, Justified Models and a reasonable relaxation of the DI semantics) actually coincide, constituting a common single approach under different definitions. Moreover, this common semantics always provides a superset of the stable models of a program (in fact, modulo any context) and is strictly stronger than the fourth approach (Strongly Supported Models), that actually treats disjunctions as in classical logic.",

        "abstract": "This chapter introduces a conceptual framework for qualitative risk assessment of AI, particularly in the context of the EU AI Act. The framework addresses the complexities of legal compliance and fundamental rights protection by itegrating definitional balancing and defeasible reasoning. Definitional balancing employs proportionality analysis to resolve conflicts between competing rights, while defeasible reasoning accommodates the dynamic nature of legal decision-making. Our approach stresses the need for an analysis of AI deployment scenarios and for identifying potential legal violations and multi-layered impacts on fundamental rights. On the basis of this analysis, we provide philosophical foundations for a logical account of AI risk analysis. In particular, we consider the basic building blocks for conceptually grasping the interaction between AI deployment scenarios and fundamental rights, incorporating in defeasible reasoning definitional balancing and arguments about the contextual promotion or demotion of rights. This layered approach allows for more operative models of assessment of both high-risk AI systems and General Purpose AI (GPAI) systems, emphasizing the broader applicability of the latter. Future work aims to develop a formal model and effective algorithms to enhance AI risk assessment, bridging theoretical insights with practical applications to support responsible AI governance.",

This is a challenging problem that we seek to tackle using a combination of a computer algebra system, an SMT solver and a term rewriting system. A Large Language Model is used to interpret and remove errors from student responses and rewrite these in a machine readable format. Once formalized and language-aligned, the next step then consists in applying automated reasoning techniques for assessing student solution correctness. We consider two methods of automated theorem proving: off-the-shelf SMT solving and term rewriting systems tailored for physics problems involving trigonometric expressions. The development of the term rewrite system and establishing termination and confluence properties was not trivial, and we describe it in some detail in the paper.

By leveraging simple rule-based rewards, RL effectively incentivizes LLMs to produce extended chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning trajectories, progressively guiding them toward correct answers. However, existing approaches remain largely heuristic and intuition-driven, limiting the development of principled methodologies. In this paper, we present a theoretical characterization of LLM reasoning grounded in information bottleneck (IB) principle, introducing IB-aware reasoning optimization (IBRO), a framework that encourages reasoning trajectories to be both informative about the final correct answer and generalizable across diverse prompts. We derive a practical token-level surrogate objective and propose an efficient approximation, resulting in the lightweight IB regularization method. This technique integrates seamlessly into existing RL-based post-training frameworks without additional computational overhead, requiring only a one-line code modification. Empirically, we validate IB regularization across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks and RL algorithms, demonstrating consistent improvements in LLM reasoning performance.",

Two methods are compared: a model-based approach using Value Iteration (VI) under known system dynamics, and a model-free approach using Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) that learns from experience. For the model-based approach, a theoretical model is used, while a simulation model combining Discrete Event Simulation (DES) with the OpenAI Gym environment is developed for model-free learning. Both models frame the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) within a Skills-Based Routing (SBR) framework, with Poisson client arrivals and exponentially distributed service and abandonment times. For policy evaluation, random, VI, and PPO policies are evaluated using the simulation model. After 1,000 test episodes, PPO consistently achives the highest rewards, along with the lowest client waiting time and staff idle time, despite requiring longer training time.",

This work focuses on a specific form of constraint, the so-called table constraint, used to specify conditions on the values of variables as an enumeration of alternative options. Since every condition on a set of finite domain variables can be ultimately expressed as a finite set of cases, Table can, in principle, simulate any other constraint. These characteristics make Table one of the most studied constraints ever, leading to a series of increasingly efficient propagation algorithms. Despite this, it is not uncommon to encounter real-world problems with hundreds or thousands of valid cases that are simply too many to be handled effectively with standard CPU-based approaches. In this paper, we deal with the Compact-Table (CT) algorithm, the state-of-the-art propagation algorithms for Table. We describe how CT can be enhanced by exploiting the massive computational power offered by modern GPUs to handle large Table constraints. In particular, we report on the design and implementation of GPU-accelerated CT, on its integration into an existing constraint solver, and on an experimental validation performed on a significant set of instances.",

Concept probing works by training additional classifiers to map the internal representations of a model into human-defined concepts of interest, thus allowing humans to peek inside artificial neural networks. Research on concept probing has mainly focused on the model being probed or the probing model itself, paying limited attention to the data required to train such probing models. In this paper, we address this gap. Focusing on concept probing in the context of image classification tasks, we investigate the effect of the data used to train probing models on their performance.

It is developed by our proposed SafeLadder framework, which incorporates large-scale, progressive, safety-oriented reinforcement learning post-training, supported by a suite of multi-principled verifiers. Unlike previous alignment methods such as RLHF that simply learn human preferences, SafeLadder enables SafeWork-R1 to develop intrinsic safety reasoning and self-reflection abilities, giving rise to safety `aha' moments. Notably, SafeWork-R1 achieves an average improvement of $46.54\\%$ over its base model Qwen2.5-VL-72B on safety-related benchmarks without compromising general capabilities, and delivers state-of-the-art safety performance compared to leading proprietary models such as GPT-4.1 and Claude Opus 4. To further bolster its reliability, we implement two distinct inference-time intervention methods and a deliberative search mechanism, enforcing step-level verification. Finally, we further develop SafeWork-R1-InternVL3-78B, SafeWork-R1-DeepSeek-70B, and SafeWork-R1-Qwen2.5VL-7B. All resulting models demonstrate that safety and capability can co-evolve synergistically, highlighting the generalizability of our framework in building robust, reliable, and trustworthy general-purpose AI.",

Although existing methods achieve comparable performance, they inevitably suffer from performance degradation under sample heterogeneity caused by multi-source data and individual expression variability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, called Heterogeneity-aware Distributional Framework (HDF), and design two plug-and-play modules to enhance time-frequency modeling and mitigate optimization imbalance caused by hard samples. Specifically, the Time-Frequency Distributional Attention Module (DAM) captures both temporal consistency and frequency robustness through a dual-branch attention design, improving tolerance to sequence inconsistency and visual style shifts. Then, based on gradient sensitivity and information bottleneck principles, an adaptive optimization module Distribution-aware Scaling Module (DSM) is introduced to dynamically balance classification and contrastive losses, enabling more stable and discriminative representation learning. Extensive experiments on two widely used datasets, DFEW and FERV39k, demonstrate that HDF significantly improves both recognition accuracy and robustness. Our method achieves superior weighted average recall (WAR) and unweighted average recall (UAR) while maintaining strong generalization across diverse and imbalanced scenarios.

Effective communication strategies among LLM agents improve collaborative problem-solving efficiency and facilitate cost-effective adoption in education. However, little research has systematically evaluated the impact of different communication strategies on agents' problem-solving. Our study examines four communication modes, \\textit{teacher-student interaction}, \\textit{peer-to-peer collaboration}, \\textit{reciprocal peer teaching}, and \\textit{critical debate}, in a dual-agent, chat-based mathematical problem-solving environment using the OpenAI GPT-4o model. Evaluated on the MATH dataset, our results show that dual-agent setups outperform single agents, with \\textit{peer-to-peer collaboration} achieving the highest accuracy. Dialogue acts like statements, acknowledgment, and hints play a key role in collaborative problem-solving. While multi-agent frameworks enhance computational tasks, effective communication strategies are essential for tackling complex problems in AI education.",

In this work, we introduce a custom-built ambient scribe application integrated into the EHR system at Included Health, a personalized all-in-one healthcare company offering telehealth services. The application uses Whisper for transcription and a modular in-context learning pipeline with GPT-4o to automatically generate SOAP notes and patient instructions. Testing on mock visit data shows that the notes generated by the application exceed the quality of expert-written notes as determined by an LLM-as-a-judge. The application has been widely adopted by the clinical practice, with over 540 clinicians at Included Health using the application at least once. 94% (n = 63) of surveyed clinicians report reduced cognitive load during visits and 97% (n = 66) report less documentation burden when using the application. Additionally, we show that post-processing notes with a fine-tuned BART model improves conciseness.

Novices often struggle with cognitive biases such as premature closure and over-reliance on heuristics. Scenario-based learning (SBL) can address these challenges by offering realistic case experiences and iterative practice, but the optimal sequencing of instruction and problem-solving activities remains unclear. This study examines how personalized support can be incorporated into different instructional sequences and whether providing explicit diagnostic strategy instruction before (I-PS) or after problem-solving (PS-I) improves learning and its transfer. We employ a between-groups design in an online SBL environment called PharmaSim, which simulates real-world client interactions for pharmacy technician apprentices.

This study compared performances of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), Graph Attention Networks (GATs) and Graph Isomorphism Networks (GINs), applied to 7 different toxicological assay datasets of varying data abundance and endpoint, to perform binary classification of assay activation. Following pre-processing of molecular graphs, enforcement of class-balance and stratification of all datasets across 5 folds, Bayesian optimisations were carried out, for each GNN applied to each assay dataset (resulting in 21 unique Bayesian optimisations). Optimised GNNs performed at Area Under the Curve (AUC) scores ranging from 0.728-0.849 (averaged across all folds), naturally varying between specific assays and GNNs. GINs were found to consistently outperform GCNs and GATs, for the top 5 of 7 most data-abundant toxicological assays. GATs however significantly outperformed over the remaining 2 most data-scarce assays. This indicates that GINs are a more optimal architecture for data-abundant environments, whereas GATs are a more optimal architecture for data-scarce environments. Subsequent analysis of the explored higher-dimensional hyperparameter spaces, as well as optimised hyperparameter states, found that GCNs and GATs reached measurably closer optimised states with each other, compared to GINs, further indicating the unique nature of GINs as a GNN algorithm.",

A main reason is that the accessibility relations for the implicit knowledge operator contained in the packaged operators of ignorance and Rumsfeld ignorance are the same. In this work, we assume the two accessibility relations to be different so that one of them is an arbitrary subset of the other. This will avoid the definability issue and retain most of the previous validities. The main results are axiomatizations over various proper bi-frame classes.

        "abstract": "Foundation models pre-trained on massive datasets, including large language models (LLMs), vision-language models (VLMs), and large multimodal models, have demonstrated remarkable success in diverse downstream tasks. However, recent studies have shown fundamental limitations of these models: (1) limited representational capacity, (2) lower adaptability, and (3) diminishing scalability. These shortcomings raise a critical question: is Euclidean geometry truly the optimal inductive bias for all foundation models, or could incorporating alternative geometric spaces enable models to better align with the intrinsic structure of real-world data and improve reasoning processes? Hyperbolic spaces, a class of non-Euclidean manifolds characterized by exponential volume growth with respect to distance, offer a mathematically grounded solution. These spaces enable low-distortion embeddings of hierarchical structures (e.g., trees, taxonomies) and power-law distributions with substantially fewer dimensions compared to Euclidean counterparts. Recent advances have leveraged these properties to enhance foundation models, including improving LLMs' complex reasoning ability, VLMs' zero-shot generalization, and cross-modal semantic alignment, while maintaining parameter efficiency. This paper provides a comprehensive review of hyperbolic neural networks and their recent development for foundation models. We further outline key challenges and research directions to advance the field.",

        "abstract": "When using LLMs to rank items based on given criteria, or evaluate answers, the order of candidate items can influence the model's final decision. This sensitivity to item positioning in a LLM's prompt is known as position bias. Prior research shows that this bias exists even in large models, though its severity varies across models and tasks. In addition to position bias, LLMs also exhibit varying degrees of low repetition consistency, where repeating the LLM call with the same candidate ordering can lead to different rankings. To address both inconsistencies, a common approach is to prompt the model multiple times with different candidate orderings and aggregate the results via majority voting. However, this repetition strategy, significantly increases computational costs. Extending prior findings, we observe that both the direction -- favoring either the earlier or later candidate in the prompt -- and magnitude of position bias across instances vary substantially, even within a single dataset. This observation highlights the need for a per-instance mitigation strategy. To this end, we introduce a dynamic early-stopping method that adaptively determines the number of repetitions required for each instance. Evaluating our approach across three LLMs of varying sizes and on two tasks, namely re-ranking and alignment, we demonstrate that transitioning to a dynamic repetition strategy reduces the number of LLM calls by an average of 81%, while preserving the accuracy.

Current approaches struggle to capture the nuanced biomechanical transitions essential for meaningful sports analysis, often missing critical phases like preparation, execution, and follow-through that occur within seconds. To address these limitations, we introduce SV3.3B, a lightweight 3.3B parameter video understanding model that combines novel temporal motion difference sampling with self-supervised learning for efficient on-device deployment. Our approach employs a DWT-VGG16-LDA based keyframe extraction mechanism that intelligently identifies the 16 most representative frames from sports sequences, followed by a V-DWT-JEPA2 encoder pretrained through mask-denoising objectives and an LLM decoder fine-tuned for sports action description generation. Evaluated on a subset of the NSVA basketball dataset, SV3.3B achieves superior performance across both traditional text generation metrics and sports-specific evaluation criteria, outperforming larger closed-source models including GPT-4o variants while maintaining significantly lower computational requirements. Our model demonstrates exceptional capability in generating technically detailed and analytically rich sports descriptions, achieving 29.2% improvement over GPT-4o in ground truth validation metrics, with substantial improvements in information density, action complexity, and measurement precision metrics essential for comprehensive athletic analysis.

However, their susceptibility to learning non-biological technical features -- including variations in surgical/endoscopic techniques, laboratory procedures, and scanner hardware -- poses risks for clinical deployment. We present the first systematic investigation of pathology FM robustness to non-biological features. Our work (i) introduces measures to quantify FM robustness, (ii) demonstrates the consequences of limited robustness, and (iii) proposes a framework for FM robustification to mitigate these issues. Specifically, we developed PathoROB, a robustness benchmark with three novel metrics, including the robustness index, and four datasets covering 28 biological classes from 34 medical centers. Our experiments reveal robustness deficits across all 20 evaluated FMs, and substantial robustness differences between them. We found that non-robust FM representations can cause major diagnostic downstream errors and clinical blunders that prevent safe clinical adoption. Using more robust FMs and post-hoc robustification considerably reduced (but did not yet eliminate) the risk of such errors. This work establishes that robustness evaluation is essential for validating pathology FMs before clinical adoption and demonstrates that future FM development must integrate robustness as a core design principle. PathoROB provides a blueprint for assessing robustness across biomedical domains, guiding FM improvement efforts towards more robust, representative, and clinically deployable AI systems that prioritize biological information over technical artifacts.",

In this work, we propose a novel explainability framework, GraphEXT, which leverages cooperative game theory and the concept of social externalities. GraphEXT partitions graph nodes into coalitions, decomposing the original graph into independent subgraphs. By integrating graph structure as an externality and incorporating the Shapley value under externalities, GraphEXT quantifies node importance through their marginal contributions to GNN predictions as the nodes transition between coalitions. Unlike traditional Shapley value-based methods that primarily focus on node attributes, our GraphEXT places greater emphasis on the interactions among nodes and the impact of structural changes on GNN predictions. Experimental studies on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that GraphEXT outperforms existing baseline methods in terms of fidelity across diverse GNN architectures , significantly enhancing the explainability of GNN models.",

Specifically, we decompose a complex prompt into a sequence of simplified sub-prompts, guiding the generation process in stages. This staged generation leverages the inherent layout-controlling capacity of self-attention to first ensure global composition, followed by precise refinement. To achieve accurate binding between attributes and corresponding subjects, we exploit cross-attention mechanisms and further introduce a Centroid Alignment Loss at test time to reduce binding noise and enhance attribute consistency. Extensive experiments on T2I-CompBench and a newly constructed style composition benchmark demonstrate that Detail++ significantly outperforms existing methods, particularly in scenarios involving multiple objects and complex stylistic conditions.",

A key challenge in fairness assessment is to ensure that the evaluation dataset is sufficiently representative of different Personal Identifiable Information (PII) (sex, age, and race) and other minority groups. Against the backdrop of this challenge, this study leverages the state-of-the-art Generative AI (GenAI) LightningDiT model to assess the fairness of publicly available melanoma classifiers. The results suggest that fairness assessment using highly realistic synthetic data is a promising direction. Yet, our findings indicate that verifying fairness becomes difficult when the melanoma-detection model used for evaluation is trained on data that differ from the dataset underpinning the synthetic images.

A truncated MDP is proposed to reduce the number of states in the MDP by learning a Hamming ball with a specified radius around codewords. We then propose a general scheme for reinforcement learning based decoders applicable to any class of codes to improve the performance of decoders. We call this scheme an action-list decoding. We design an action-list decoder based on the Deep-Q network values that substantially enhance performance. We also get benefit of automorphism group of code to further improve the code performance. Additionally, we propose a feedback-based method to exploit and enhance the performance of existing high-performing decoders by applying reinforcement learning algorithms after the existing decoders. These approaches effectively reduces the complexity of the reinforcement learning block.

Specifically, we develop a property-variational autoencoder (pVAE), a variational autoencoder (VAE) augmented with a regressor, to generate structured metamaterials with tailored hydraulic properties, such as porosity and permeability. While this work uses the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) to generate intrinsic permeability tensor data for limited porous microstructures, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained using a bottom-up approach to predict effective hydraulic properties. This significantly reduces the computational cost compared to direct LBM simulations. The pVAE framework is trained on two datasets: a synthetic dataset of artificial porous microstructures and CT-scan images of volume elements from real open-cell foams. The encoder-decoder architecture of the VAE captures key microstructural features, mapping them into a compact and interpretable latent space for efficient structure-property exploration. The study provides a detailed analysis and interpretation of the latent space, demonstrating its role in structure-property mapping, interpolation, and inverse design.

To combine the strengths of both human and machine approaches, we propose Seed2Harvest, a hybrid red-teaming method for guided expansion of culturally diverse, human-crafted adversarial prompt seeds. The resulting prompts preserve the characteristics and attack patterns of human prompts while maintaining comparable average attack success rates (0.31 NudeNet, 0.36 SD NSFW, 0.12 Q16). Our expanded dataset achieves substantially higher diversity with 535 unique geographic locations and a Shannon entropy of 7.48, compared to 58 locations and 5.28 entropy in the original dataset. Our work demonstrates the importance of human-machine collaboration in leveraging human creativity and machine computational capacity to achieve comprehensive, scalable red-teaming for continuous T2I model safety evaluation.",

        "abstract": "Accurate population flow prediction is essential for urban planning, transportation management, and public health. Yet existing methods face key limitations: traditional models rely on static spatial assumptions, deep learning models struggle with cross-city generalization, and Large Language Models (LLMs) incur high computational costs while failing to capture spatial structure. Moreover, many approaches sacrifice resolution by clustering Points of Interest (POIs) or restricting coverage to subregions, limiting their utility for city-wide analytics. We introduce UrbanPulse, a scalable deep learning framework that delivers ultra-fine-grained, city-wide OD flow predictions by treating each POI as an individual node. It combines a temporal graph convolutional encoder with a transformer-based decoder to model multi-scale spatiotemporal dependencies. To ensure robust generalization across urban contexts, UrbanPulse employs a three-stage transfer learning strategy: pretraining on large-scale urban graphs, cold-start adaptation, and reinforcement learning this http URL on over 103 million cleaned GPS records from three metropolitan areas in California, UrbanPulse achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and scalability. Through efficient transfer learning, UrbanPulse takes a key step toward making high-resolution, AI-powered urban forecasting deployable in practice across diverse cities.",

However, existing studies face three major limitations: (1) treating the task as unimodal categorization, which fails to leverage multimodal cues and fine-grained quality distinctions; (2) introducing noise during deep multimodal fusion, leading to misleading signals; and (3) lacking the ability to capture complex semantic relationships like relevance and comprehensiveness. To address these issues, we propose the Multimodal Fine-grained Topic-post Relational Reasoning (MFTRR) framework, which mimics human cognitive processes. MFTRR reframes post-quality assessment as a ranking task and incorporates multimodal data to better capture quality variations. It consists of two key modules: (1) the Local-Global Semantic Correlation Reasoning Module, which models fine-grained semantic interactions between posts and topics at both local and global levels, enhanced by a maximum information fusion mechanism to suppress noise; and (2) the Multi-Level Evidential Relational Reasoning Module, which explores macro- and micro-level relational cues to strengthen evidence-based reasoning. We evaluate MFTRR on three newly constructed multimodal topic-post datasets and the public Lazada-Home dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that MFTRR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 9.52% NDCG@3 improvement over the best unimodal method on the Art History dataset.",

We introduce Adversarial PhoneTic Prompting (APT), a novel attack where lyrics are semantically altered while preserving their acoustic structure through homophonic substitutions (e.g., Eminem's famous \"mom's spaghetti\" $\\rightarrow$ \"Bob's confetti\"). Despite these distortions, we uncover a powerful form of sub-lexical memorization: models like SUNO and YuE regenerate outputs strikingly similar to known training content, achieving high similarity across audio-domain metrics, including CLAP, AudioJudge, and CoverID. This vulnerability persists across multiple languages and genres. More surprisingly, we discover that phoneme-altered lyrics alone can trigger visual memorization in text-to-video models. When prompted with phonetically modified lyrics from Lose Yourself, Veo 3 reconstructs visual elements from the original music video -- including character appearance and scene composition -- despite no visual cues in the prompt. We term this phenomenon phonetic-to-visual regurgitation. Together, these findings expose a critical vulnerability in transcript-conditioned multimodal generation: phonetic prompting alone can unlock memorized audiovisual content, raising urgent questions about copyright, safety, and content provenance in modern generative systems.

The reconstructor is evaluated under a distortion function, while each adversary is evaluated using a separate loss function. The privatizer ensures the reconstructor distortion remains below a fixed threshold while maximizing the minimum loss across the two adversaries. This two-adversary setting models cases where individual users cannot reconstruct the data accurately, but their combined side information enables estimation within the distortion threshold. The privatizer maximizes individual loss while permitting accurate reconstruction only through collaboration. This echoes secret-sharing principles, but with lossy rather than perfect recovery. We frame this as a constrained data-driven minimax optimization problem and propose a data-driven training procedure that alternately updates the privatizer, reconstructor, and adversaries. We also analyze the Gaussian and binary cases as special scenarios where optimal solutions can be obtained.

LLMs have led to questions about writing integrity, thereby driving the creation of artificial intelligence (AI) detection technologies. Adversarial attacks, such as standard and humanized paraphrasing, inhibit detectors' ability to detect machine-generated text. Previous studies have mainly focused on ChatGPT and other well-known LLMs and have shown varying accuracy across detectors. However, there is a clear gap in the literature about DeepSeek, a recently published LLM. Therefore, in this work, we investigate whether six generally accessible AI detection tools -- AI Text Classifier, Content Detector AI, Copyleaks, QuillBot, GPT-2, and GPTZero -- can consistently recognize text generated by DeepSeek. The detectors were exposed to the aforementioned adversarial attacks. We also considered DeepSeek as a detector by performing few-shot prompting and chain-of-thought reasoning (CoT) for classifying AI and human-written text. We collected 49 human-authored question-answer pairs from before the LLM era and generated matching responses using DeepSeek-v3, producing 49 AI-generated samples. Then, we applied adversarial techniques such as paraphrasing and humanizing to add 196 more samples. These were used to challenge detector robustness and assess accuracy impact. While QuillBot and Copyleaks showed near-perfect performance on original and paraphrased DeepSeek text, others -- particularly AI Text Classifier and GPT-2 -- showed inconsistent results. The most effective attack was humanization, reducing accuracy to 71% for Copyleaks, 58% for QuillBot, and 52% for GPTZero. Few-shot and CoT prompting showed high accuracy, with the best five-shot result misclassifying only one of 49 samples (AI recall 96%, human recall 100%).",

Across four datasets-comprising retracted, conflicting, comprehensive, and settled science corpora-the VERIRAG approach consistently outperforms all baselines, achieving absolute F1 scores ranging from 0.53 to 0.65, representing a 10 to 14 point improvement over the next-best method in each respective dataset.

In this short paper, we further improve GA by 1) developing an optimized pipeline that accelerates the dataloading process and streamlines the forward pass of GA to achieve better computational efficiency; and 2) incorporating a model ensembling strategy and a post-hoc model explanation function based on the GeoShapley framework to enhance model explainability. We validate the functionality and efficiency of the proposed strategies by applying the improved GA model to synthetic datasets. Experimental results show that our implementation improves the prediction accuracy and inference speed of GA compared to the original implementation. Moreover, explanation experiments indicate that GA can effectively captures the inherent spatial effects in the designed synthetic dataset.

Yet little is known about how educators actually use these tools in practice and how their interactions with AI can be meaningfully studied at scale. This paper presents a human-AI collaborative methodology for large-scale qualitative analysis of over 140,000 educator-AI messages drawn from a generative AI platform used by K-12 teachers. Through a four-phase coding pipeline, we combined inductive theme discovery, codebook development, structured annotation, and model benchmarking to examine patterns of educator engagement and evaluate the performance of LLMs in qualitative coding tasks. We developed a hierarchical codebook aligned with established teacher evaluation frameworks, capturing educators' instructional goals, contextual needs, and pedagogical strategies. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs, particularly Claude 3.5 Haiku, can reliably support theme identification, extend human recognition in complex scenarios, and outperform open-weight models in both accuracy and structural reliability. The analysis also reveals substantive patterns in how educators inquire AI to enhance instructional practices (79.7 percent of total conversations), create or adapt content (76.1 percent), support assessment and feedback loop (46.9 percent), attend to student needs for tailored instruction (43.3 percent), and assist other professional responsibilities (34.2 percent), highlighting emerging AI-related competencies that have direct implications for teacher preparation and professional development. This study offers a scalable, transparent model for AI-augmented qualitative research and provides foundational insights into the evolving role of generative AI in educational practice.",

Each architectural modification has been shown to improve model performance in LLMs, but has yet to be adopted in CoCa. We benchmarked GRR-CoCa against Baseline CoCa, a model with the same modified textual decoders but with CoCa's original ViT encoder. We used standard pretraining and fine-tuning workflows to benchmark the models on contrastive and generative tasks. Our GRR-CoCa significantly outperformed Baseline CoCa on the pretraining dataset and three diverse fine-tuning datasets. Pretraining improvements were 27.25% in contrastive loss, 3.71% in perplexity, and 7.15% in CoCa loss. The average fine-tuning improvements were 13.66% in contrastive loss, 5.18% in perplexity, and 5.55% in CoCa loss.

Due to the need for a large amount of data, a user simulator is employed for both training and evaluation. Such user simulators critique the current retrieved item based on knowledge of a single target item. However, system evaluation in offline settings with simulators is limited by the focus on a single target item and their unlimited patience over a large number of turns. To overcome these limitations of existing simulators, we propose Fashion-AlterEval, a new dataset that contains human judgments for a selection of alternative items by adding new annotations in common fashion CRS datasets. Consequently, we propose two novel meta-user simulators that use the collected judgments and allow simulated users not only to express their preferences about alternative items to their original target, but also to change their mind and level of patience. In our experiments using the Shoes and Fashion IQ as the original datasets and three CRS models, we find that using the knowledge of alternatives by the simulator can have a considerable impact on the evaluation of existing CRS models, specifically that the existing single-target evaluation underestimates their effectiveness, and when simulatedusers are allowed to instead consider alternative relevant items, the system can rapidly respond to more quickly satisfy the user.",

One possible solution is Locate-and-Edit (L\\&E), allowing simultaneous modifications of a massive number of facts.

In this paper, we model existing linear L\\&E methods as querying a Key-Value (KV) database. From this perspective, we then propose NeuralDB, an editing framework that explicitly represents the edited facts as a neural KV database equipped with a non-linear gated retrieval module, % In particular, our gated module only operates when inference involves the edited facts, effectively preserving the general abilities of LLMs. Comprehensive experiments involving the editing of 10,000 facts were conducted on the ZsRE and CounterFacts datasets, using GPT2-XL, GPT-J (6B) and Llama-3 (8B). The results demonstrate that NeuralDB not only excels in editing efficacy, generalization, specificity, fluency, and consistency, but also preserves overall performance across six representative text understanding and generation tasks. Further experiments indicate that NeuralDB maintains its effectiveness even when scaled to 100,000 facts (\\textbf{50x} more than in prior work).",

Traditional deepfake detection approaches often struggle with sophisticated, customized deepfakes, especially in terms of generalization and robustness against malicious attacks. This paper introduces ViGText, a novel approach that integrates images with Vision Large Language Model (VLLM) Text explanations within a Graph-based framework to improve deepfake detection. The novelty of ViGText lies in its integration of detailed explanations with visual data, as it provides a more context-aware analysis than captions, which often lack specificity and fail to reveal subtle inconsistencies. ViGText systematically divides images into patches, constructs image and text graphs, and integrates them for analysis using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to identify deepfakes. Through the use of multi-level feature extraction across spatial and frequency domains, ViGText captures details that enhance its robustness and accuracy to detect sophisticated deepfakes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViGText significantly enhances generalization and achieves a notable performance boost when it detects user-customized deepfakes. Specifically, average F1 scores rise from 72.45% to 98.32% under generalization evaluation, and reflects the model's superior ability to generalize to unseen, fine-tuned variations of stable diffusion models. As for robustness, ViGText achieves an increase of 11.1% in recall compared to other deepfake detection approaches. When facing targeted attacks that exploit its graph-based architecture, ViGText limits classification performance degradation to less than 4%. ViGText uses detailed visual and textual analysis to set a new standard for detecting deepfakes, helping ensure media authenticity and information integrity.",

However, despite recent progress, bridging the gap between language descriptions and actual robot actions in the open-world, beyond merely invoking limited predefined motion primitives, remains an open challenge. In this work, we aim to enable robots to interpret and decompose complex language instructions, ultimately synthesizing a sequence of trajectory points to complete diverse navigation tasks given open-set instructions and open-set objects. We observe that multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit strong cross-modal understanding when processing free-form language instructions, demonstrating robust scene comprehension. More importantly, leveraging their code-generation capability, MLLMs can interact with vision-language perception models to generate compositional 2D bird-eye-view value maps, effectively integrating semantic knowledge from MLLMs with spatial information from maps to reinforce the robot's spatial understanding. To further validate our approach, we effectively leverage large-scale autonomous vehicle datasets (AVDs) to validate our proposed zero-shot vision-language navigation framework in outdoor navigation tasks, demonstrating its capability to execute a diverse range of free-form natural language navigation instructions while maintaining robustness against object detection errors and linguistic ambiguities. Furthermore, we validate our system on a Husky robot in both indoor and outdoor scenes, demonstrating its real-world robustness and applicability.

However, most existing approaches rely on fixed, global intervention vectors, overlook the causal influence of individual input tokens, and fail to leverage informative gradients from the model's logits, particularly in multimodal settings where visual and textual inputs contribute unevenly. To address these limitations, we introduce GrAInS, an inference-time steering approach that operates across both language-only and vision-language models and tasks. GrAInS uses contrastive, gradient-based attribution via Integrated Gradients to identify the top-k most influential tokens, both positively and negatively attributed based on their contribution to preferred versus dispreferred outputs. These tokens are then used to construct directional steering vectors that capture semantic shifts from undesirable to desirable behavior. During inference, GrAInS adjusts hidden activations at transformer layers guided by token-level attribution signals, and normalizes activations to preserve representational scale. This enables fine-grained, interpretable, and modular control over model behavior, without retraining or auxiliary supervision. Empirically, GrAInS consistently outperforms both fine-tuning and existing steering baselines: it achieves a 13.22% accuracy gain on TruthfulQA using Llama-3.1-8B, reduces hallucination rates on MMHal-Bench from 0.624 to 0.514 with LLaVA-1.6-7B, and improves alignment win rates on SPA-VL by 8.11%, all while preserving the model's fluency and general capabilities.",

Most open-source models are trained on datasets consisting of single-scene video clips, which limits their capacity to learn and respond to prompts requiring multiple scenes. Developing scene transition awareness is essential for multi-scene generation, as it allows models to identify and segment videos into distinct clips by accurately detecting transitions. To address this, we propose the \\textbf{Transition-Aware Video} (TAV) dataset, which consists of preprocessed video clips with multiple scene transitions.

In this paper, we propose TELEVAL, a dynamic benchmark specifically designed to evaluate SLMs' effectiveness as conversational agents in realistic Chinese interactive settings. TELEVAL defines three evaluation dimensions: Explicit Semantics, Paralinguistic and Implicit Semantics, and System Abilities. It adopts a dialogue format consistent with real-world usage and evaluates text and audio outputs separately. TELEVAL particularly focuses on the model's ability to extract implicit cues from user speech and respond appropriately without additional instructions. Our experiments demonstrate that despite recent progress, existing SLMs still have considerable room for improvement in natural conversational tasks. We hope that TELEVAL can serve as a user-centered evaluation framework that directly reflects the user experience and contributes to the development of more capable dialogue-oriented SLMs.",

        "abstract": "Pancreatic cancer carries a poor prognosis and relies on endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) for targeted biopsy and radiotherapy. However, the speckle noise, low contrast, and unintuitive appearance of EUS make segmentation of pancreatic tumors with fully supervised deep learning (DL) models both error-prone and dependent on large, expert-curated annotation datasets. To address these challenges, we present TextSAM-EUS, a novel, lightweight, text-driven adaptation of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) that requires no manual geometric prompts at inference. Our approach leverages text prompt learning (context optimization) through the BiomedCLIP text encoder in conjunction with a LoRA-based adaptation of SAM's architecture to enable automatic pancreatic tumor segmentation in EUS, tuning only 0.86% of the total parameters. On the public Endoscopic Ultrasound Database of the Pancreas, TextSAM-EUS with automatic prompts attains 82.69% Dice and 85.28% normalized surface distance (NSD), and with manual geometric prompts reaches 83.10% Dice and 85.70% NSD, outperforming both existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) supervised DL models and foundation models (e.g., SAM and its variants). As the first attempt to incorporate prompt learning in SAM-based medical image segmentation, TextSAM-EUS offers a practical option for efficient and robust automatic EUS segmentation. Our code will be publicly available upon acceptance.",

However, conventional methods such as Monte Carlo (MC) Dropout often focus solely on either model or data uncertainty, failing to align with the semantic objective of OoD detection. To address this, we propose the Free-Energy Posterior Network, a novel framework that jointly models distributional uncertainty and identifying OoD and misclassified regions using free energy. Our method introduces two key contributions: (1) a free-energy-based density estimator parameterized by a Beta distribution, which enables fine-grained uncertainty estimation near ambiguous or unseen regions; and (2) a loss integrated within a posterior network, allowing direct uncertainty estimation from learned parameters without requiring stochastic sampling. By integrating our approach with the residual prediction branch (RPL) framework, the proposed method goes beyond post-hoc energy thresholding and enables the network to learn OoD regions by leveraging the variance of the Beta distribution, resulting in a semantically meaningful and computationally efficient solution for uncertainty-aware segmentation. We validate the effectiveness of our method on challenging real-world benchmarks, including Fishyscapes, RoadAnomaly, and Segment-Me-If-You-Can.",

Our results demonstrate that TenVOO achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-scale structural similarity index measure (MS-SSIM), outperforming existing approaches in capturing spatial dependencies while requiring only 0.3% of the trainable parameters of the original model.

However, most existing models treat speech merely as a vehicle for linguistic content, often overlooking the rich paralinguistic and speaker characteristic cues embedded in human speech, such as dialect, age, emotion, and non-speech vocalizations. In this work, we introduce GOAT-SLM, a novel spoken language model with paralinguistic and speaker characteristic awareness, designed to extend spoken language modeling beyond text semantics. GOAT-SLM adopts a dual-modality head architecture that decouples linguistic modeling from acoustic realization, enabling robust language understanding while supporting expressive and adaptive speech generation. To enhance model efficiency and versatility, we propose a modular, staged training strategy that progressively aligns linguistic, paralinguistic, and speaker characteristic information using large-scale speech-text corpora. Experimental results on TELEVAL, a multi-dimensional evaluation benchmark, demonstrate that GOAT-SLM achieves well-balanced performance across both semantic and non-semantic tasks, and outperforms existing open-source models in handling emotion, dialectal variation, and age-sensitive interactions. This work highlights the importance of modeling beyond linguistic content and advances the development of more natural, adaptive, and socially aware spoken language systems.",

HIV management is a compelling use case due to its complexity, including diverse treatment options, comorbidities, and adherence challenges. However, integrating LLMs into clinical practice raises concerns about accuracy, potential harm, and clinician acceptance. Despite their promise, AI applications in HIV care remain underexplored, and LLM benchmarking studies are scarce. This study evaluates the current capabilities of LLMs in HIV management, highlighting their strengths and limitations. We introduce HIVMedQA, a benchmark designed to assess open-ended medical question answering in HIV care. The dataset consists of curated, clinically relevant questions developed with input from an infectious disease physician. We evaluated seven general-purpose and three medically specialized LLMs, applying prompt engineering to enhance performance. Our evaluation framework incorporates both lexical similarity and an LLM-as-a-judge approach, extended to better reflect clinical relevance. We assessed performance across key dimensions: question comprehension, reasoning, knowledge recall, bias, potential harm, and factual accuracy. Results show that Gemini 2.5 Pro consistently outperformed other models across most dimensions. Notably, two of the top three models were proprietary. Performance declined as question complexity increased. Medically fine-tuned models did not always outperform general-purpose ones, and larger model size was not a reliable predictor of performance. Reasoning and comprehension were more challenging than factual recall, and cognitive biases such as recency and status quo were observed. These findings underscore the need for targeted development and evaluation to ensure safe, effective LLM integration in clinical care.",

Given this gap, this paper systematically investigates robust node classification for class-imbalanced graphs with noisy labels.

Specifically, we design an LLM-based oversampling method to generate synthetic minority nodes, producing label-accurate minority nodes to alleviate class imbalance. Based on the class-balanced graphs, we develop a dynamically weighted pseudo-labeling method to obtain high-confidence pseudo labels to reduce label noise ratio. Additionally, we implement a secondary LLM-guided oversampling mechanism to mitigate potential class distribution skew caused by pseudo labels.

These tokens, when repeatedly inserted into sentences, pull sentence similarity toward a certain value, disrupting the normal distribution of embedding distances and degrading downstream performance. In this paper, we systematically investigate such anomalous tokens, formally defining them and introducing an efficient detection method, Sticky Token Detector (STD), based on sentence and token filtering. Applying STD to 40 checkpoints across 14 model families, we discover a total of 868 sticky tokens. Our analysis reveals that these tokens often originate from special or unused entries in the vocabulary, as well as fragmented subwords from multilingual corpora. Notably, their presence does not strictly correlate with model size or vocabulary size. We further evaluate how sticky tokens affect downstream tasks like clustering and retrieval, observing significant performance drops of up to 50%. Through attention-layer analysis, we show that sticky tokens disproportionately dominate the model's internal representations, raising concerns about tokenization robustness. Our findings show the need for better tokenization strategies and model design to mitigate the impact of sticky tokens in future text embedding applications.",

At the heart of Diff-UMamba is a Noise Reduction Module (NRM), which employs a signal differencing strategy to suppress noisy or irrelevant activations within the encoder. This encourages the model to filter out spurious features and enhance task-relevant representations, thereby improving its focus on clinically meaningful regions. As a result, the architecture achieves improved segmentation accuracy and robustness, particularly in low-data settings. Diff-UMamba is evaluated on multiple public datasets, including MSD (lung and pancreas) and AIIB23, demonstrating consistent performance gains of 1-3% over baseline methods across diverse segmentation tasks. To further assess performance under limited-data conditions, additional experiments are conducted on the BraTS-21 dataset by varying the proportion of available training samples. The approach is also validated on a small internal non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) dataset for gross tumor volume (GTV) segmentation in cone beam CT (CBCT), where it achieves a 4-5% improvement over the baseline.",

This study introduces SCOPE, an evaluation framework designed to measure and mitigate such selection bias in a dataset-independent manner. By repeatedly invoking a null prompt that lacks semantic content, SCOPE estimates each model's unique position-bias distribution. It then redistributes the answer slot according to the inverse-bias distribution, thereby equalizing the lucky-rate, the probability of selecting the correct answer by chance. Furthermore, it prevents semantically similar distractors from being placed adjacent to the answer, thereby blocking near-miss guesses based on superficial proximity cues. Across multiple benchmark experiments, SCOPE consistently outperformed existing debiasing methods in terms of stable performance improvements and showed clearer confidence distributions over correct options. This framework thus offers a new standard for enhancing the fairness and reliability of LLM evaluations.",

However, this reliance on external sources exposes a security risk, attackers can inject poisoned documents into the knowledge base to steer the generation process toward harmful or misleading outputs. In this paper, we propose Gradient-based Masked Token Probability (GMTP), a novel defense method to detect and filter out adversarially crafted documents. Specifically, GMTP identifies high-impact tokens by examining gradients of the retriever's similarity function. These key tokens are then masked, and their probabilities are checked via a Masked Language Model (MLM). Since injected tokens typically exhibit markedly low masked-token probabilities, this enables GMTP to easily detect malicious documents and achieve high-precision filtering. Experiments demonstrate that GMTP is able to eliminate over 90% of poisoned content while retaining relevant documents, thus maintaining robust retrieval and generation performance across diverse datasets and adversarial settings.",

In this work, we propose MoRPI-PINN as a physics-informed neural network framework for accurate inertial-based mobile robot navigation. By embedding physical laws and constraints into the training process, MoRPI-PINN is capable of providing an accurate and robust navigation solution. Using real-world experiments, we show accuracy improvements of over 85% compared to other approaches.

Meanwhile, current asynchronous federated learning (AFL) methods are primarily designed for conventional tasks such as image classification and natural language processing, without accounting for the unique topological properties of graph data. Directly applying these methods to graph learning can possibly result in semantic drift and representational inconsistency in the global model. To address these challenges, we propose FedSA-GCL, a semi-asynchronous federated framework that leverages both inter-client label distribution divergence and graph topological characteristics through a novel ClusterCast mechanism for efficient training. We evaluate FedSA-GCL on multiple real-world graph datasets using the Louvain and Metis split algorithms, and compare it against 9 baselines. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves strong robustness and outstanding efficiency, outperforming the baselines by an average of 2.92% with the Louvain and by 3.4% with the Metis.",

While canonical economic models assume atomistic agents act as `takers' of aggregate market conditions, a naive single-agent RL simulation incentivizes the agent to become a `manipulator' of its environment. This paper first demonstrates this discrepancy within a search-and-matching model with concave production, showing that a standard RL agent learns a non-equilibrium, monopsonistic policy. Additionally, we identify a parametric bias arising from the mismatch between economic discounting and RL's treatment of intertemporal costs. To address both issues, we propose a calibrated Mean-Field Reinforcement Learning framework that embeds a representative agent in a fixed macroeconomic field and adjusts the cost function to reflect economic opportunity costs. Our iterative algorithm converges to a self-consistent fixed point where the agent's policy aligns with the competitive equilibrium. This approach provides a tractable and theoretically sound methodology for modeling learning agents in economic systems within the broader domain of computational social science.",

We first introduce a flare-simulation module and a noise-simulation module to accurately simulate the imaging process under nighttime conditions, producing high-quality paired depth datasets for low-light conditions. Additionally, we present an effective low-light PEFT strategy that utilizes illumination guidance and multiscale feature fusion to enhance the model's capability in low-light environments.

The synergistic reasoning of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) enables cross-modal 3D spatial constraint construction. Nevertheless, existing methods have three key limitations: (1) coarse semantic granularity in constraint modeling, (2) lack of real-time closed-loop planning, (3) compromised robustness in semantically diverse environments. To address these challenges, we propose ReSem3D, a unified manipulation framework for semantically diverse environments, leveraging the synergy between VFMs and MLLMs to achieve fine-grained visual grounding and dynamically constructs hierarchical 3D spatial constraints for real-time manipulation. Specifically, the framework is driven by hierarchical recursive reasoning in MLLMs, which interact with VFMs to automatically construct 3D spatial constraints from natural language instructions and RGB-D observations in two stages: part-level extraction and region-level refinement. Subsequently, these constraints are encoded as real-time optimization objectives in joint space, enabling reactive behavior to dynamic disturbances. Extensive simulation and real-world experiments are conducted in semantically rich household and sparse chemical lab environments. The results demonstrate that ReSem3D performs diverse manipulation tasks under zero-shot conditions, exhibiting strong adaptability and generalization. Code and videos at this https URL.",

In this regard, current studies mainly concentrate on leveraging various translation knowledge into ST models. However, these methods often struggle with interference from irrelevant noise and can not fully utilize the translation knowledge. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel Locate-and-Focus method for terminology translation. It first effectively locates the speech clips containing terminologies within the utterance to construct translation knowledge, minimizing irrelevant information for the ST model. Subsequently, it associates the translation knowledge with the utterance and hypothesis from both audio and textual modalities, allowing the ST model to better focus on translation knowledge during translation. Experimental results across various datasets demonstrate that our method effectively locates terminologies within utterances and enhances the success rate of terminology translation, while maintaining robust general translation performance.",

To address this gap, we present the first specialized dataset for AI-driven TCM tongue diagnosis, comprising 6,719 high-quality images captured under standardized conditions and annotated with 20 pathological symptom categories (averaging 2.54 clinically validated labels per image, all verified by licensed TCM practitioners). The dataset supports multiple annotation formats (COCO, TXT, XML) for broad usability and has been benchmarked using nine deep learning models (YOLOv5/v7/v8 variants, SSD, and MobileNetV2) to demonstrate its utility for AI development. This resource provides a critical foundation for advancing reliable computational tools in TCM, bridging the data shortage that has hindered progress in the field, and facilitating the integration of AI into both research and clinical practice through standardized, high-quality diagnostic data.",

        "abstract": "Language Models (LMs) typically adhere to a \"pre-training and fine-tuning\" paradigm, where a universal pre-trained model can be fine-tuned to cater to various specialized domains. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has gained the most widespread use in LM fine-tuning due to its lightweight computational cost and remarkable performance. Because the proportion of parameters tuned by LoRA is relatively small, there might be a misleading impression that the LoRA fine-tuning data is invulnerable to Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs). However, we identify that utilizing the pre-trained model can induce more information leakage, which is neglected by existing MIAs. Therefore, we introduce LoRA-Leak, a holistic evaluation framework for MIAs against the fine-tuning datasets of LMs. LoRA-Leak incorporates fifteen membership inference attacks, including ten existing MIAs, and five improved MIAs that leverage the pre-trained model as a reference. In experiments, we apply LoRA-Leak to three advanced LMs across three popular natural language processing tasks, demonstrating that LoRA-based fine-tuned LMs are still vulnerable to MIAs (e.g., 0.775 AUC under conservative fine-tuning settings). We also applied LoRA-Leak to different fine-tuning settings to understand the resulting privacy risks. We further explore four defenses and find that only dropout and excluding specific LM layers during fine-tuning effectively mitigate MIA risks while maintaining utility. We highlight that under the \"pre-training and fine-tuning\" paradigm, the existence of the pre-trained model makes MIA a more severe risk for LoRA-based LMs. We hope that our findings can provide guidance on data privacy protection for specialized LM providers.",

In this study, we present the first systematic benchmark for semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SemiSeg) in ECG delineation. We curated and unified multiple public datasets, including previously underused sources, to support robust and diverse evaluation. We adopted five representative SemiSeg algorithms from computer vision, implemented them on two different architectures: the convolutional network and the transformer, and evaluated them in two different settings: in-domain and cross-domain. Additionally, we propose ECG-specific training configurations and augmentation strategies and introduce a standardized evaluation framework. Our results show that the transformer outperforms the convolutional network in semi-supervised ECG delineation. We anticipate that our benchmark will serve as a foundation for advancing semi-supervised ECG delineation methods and will facilitate further research in this domain.",

However, research focuses on specific vehicles and context, while broad deployment requires scalability across various configurations and environments. Differences in vehicle types, sensors, actuators, but also traffic regulations, legal requirements, cultural dynamics, or even ethical paradigms demand high flexibility of data-driven developed capabilities. In this paper, we address the challenge of scalable adaptation of generic capabilities to desired systems and environments. Our concept follows a two-stage fine-tuning process. In the first stage, fine-tuning to the specific environment takes place through a country-specific reward model that serves as an interface between technological adaptations and socio-political requirements. In the second stage, vehicle-specific transfer learning facilitates system adaptation and governs the validation of design decisions. In sum, our concept offers a data-driven process that integrates both technological and socio-political aspects, enabling effective scalability across technical, legal, cultural, and ethical differences.",

Deep learning models applied to spectrogram images help, but similar motifs across species cause confusion. To mitigate this, we embed frequency information into spectrograms using primary color additives. This enhances species distinction and improves classification accuracy. Our experiments show that the proposed approach achieves statistically significant gains over models without colorization and surpasses the BirdCLEF 2024 winner, improving F1 by 7.3%, ROC-AUC by 6.2%, and CMAP by 6.6%.

To bridge this gap, we introduce CLEAR, an interactive, open-source package for LLM-based error analysis. CLEAR first generates per-instance textual feedback, then it creates a set of system-level error issues, and quantifies the prevalence of each identified issue. Our package also provides users with an interactive dashboard that allows for a comprehensive error analysis through aggregate visualizations, applies interactive filters to isolate specific issues or score ranges, and drills down to the individual instances that exemplify a particular behavioral pattern. We demonstrate CLEAR analysis for RAG and Math benchmarks, and showcase its utility through a user case study.",

However, their performance in interpreting structured data, especially in tabular formats, remains limited. Although benchmarks for English tabular data are widely available, Arabic is still underrepresented because of the limited availability of public resources and its unique language features. To address this gap, we present AraTable, a novel and comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the reasoning and understanding capabilities of LLMs when applied to Arabic tabular data. AraTable consists of various evaluation tasks, such as direct question answering, fact verification, and complex reasoning, involving a wide range of Arabic tabular sources. Our methodology follows a hybrid pipeline, where initial content is generated by LLMs and subsequently filtered and verified by human experts to ensure high dataset quality. Initial analyses using AraTable show that, while LLMs perform adequately on simpler tabular tasks such as direct question answering, they continue to face significant cognitive challenges when tasks require deeper reasoning and fact verification. This indicates that there are substantial opportunities for future work to improve performance on complex tabular reasoning tasks. We also propose a fully automated evaluation framework that uses a self-deliberation mechanism and achieves performance nearly identical to that of human judges. This research provides a valuable, publicly available resource and evaluation framework that can help accelerate the development of foundational models for processing and analysing Arabic structured data.",

To address the scarcity of annotated resources, we constructed a large, varied training corpus and applied data augmentation techniques. Our best-performing model, trained with an augmentation factor of alpha = 0.20%, achieves an accuracy of 97.1% on the News test set, 91.2% on the Reference set, and 90.2% on the ASR set.

Yet, transitioning from academia to industry is complex due to the absence of standardized frameworks. This paper builds upon the authors' previously established functional and informational requirements supporting standardized DT development, focusing on a crucial aspect: transferability. While existing DT research primarily centers on asset transfer, the significance of \"sim-to-real transfer\" and \"real-to-sim transfer\"--transferring knowledge between simulations and real-world operations--is vital for comprehensive lifecycle management in DTs. A key challenge in this process is calibrating the \"reality gap,\" the discrepancy between simulated predictions and actual outcomes. Our research investigates the impact of integrating a single Reality Gap Analysis (RGA) module into an existing DT framework to effectively manage both sim-to-real and real-to-sim transfers. This integration is facilitated by data pipelines that connect the RGA module with the existing components of the DT framework, including the historical repository and the simulation model. A case study on a pedestrian bridge at Carnegie Mellon University showcases the performance of different levels of integration of our approach with an existing framework. With full implementation of an RGA module and a complete data pipeline, our approach is capable of bidirectional knowledge transfer between simulations and real-world operations without compromising efficiency.",

This paper aims to conduct a systematic review on generating synthetic medical free-text by formulating quantitative analysis to three research questions concerning (i) the purpose of generation, (ii) the techniques, and (iii) the evaluation methods. We searched PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Scopus, IEEE, Google Scholar, and arXiv databases for publications associated with generating synthetic medical unstructured free-text. We have identified 94 relevant articles out of 1,398 collected ones. A great deal of attention has been given to the generation of synthetic medical text from 2018 onwards, where the main purpose of such a generation is towards text augmentation, assistive writing, corpus building, privacy-preserving, annotation, and usefulness. Transformer architectures were the main predominant technique used to generate the text, especially the GPTs. On the other hand, there were four main aspects of evaluation, including similarity, privacy, structure, and utility, where utility was the most frequent method used to assess the generated synthetic medical text. Although the generated synthetic medical text demonstrated a moderate possibility to act as real medical documents in different downstream NLP tasks, it has proven to be a great asset as augmented, complementary to the real documents, towards improving the accuracy and overcoming sparsity/undersampling issues. Yet, privacy is still a major issue behind generating synthetic medical text, where more human assessments are needed to check for the existence of any sensitive information. Despite that, advances in generating synthetic medical text will considerably accelerate the adoption of workflows and pipeline development, discarding the time-consuming legalities of data transfer.",

We propose Sandwich, a hardware-centric CPU-based LLM serving engine that uses different execution plans for the prefill and decode phases and optimizes them separately. We evaluate Sandwich across diverse baselines and datasets on five CPU platforms, including x86 with AVX-2 and AVX-512, as well as ARM with NEON. Sandwich achieves an average 2.01x throughput improvement and 90% satisfactory time-to-first-token (TTFT) and time-per-output-token (TPOT) latencies with up to 3.40x lower requirements in single sequence serving, and significant improvement in Goodput in continuous-batching serving.

        "abstract": "Code review is one of the key processes in the software development lifecycle and is essential to maintain code quality. However, manual code review is subjective and time consuming. Given its rule-based nature, code review is well suited for automation. In recent years, significant efforts have been made to automate this process with the help of artificial intelligence. Recent developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) have also emerged as a promising tool in this area, but these models often lack the logical reasoning capabilities needed to fully understand and evaluate code. To overcome this limitation, this study proposes a hybrid approach that integrates symbolic reasoning techniques with LLMs to automate the code review process. We tested our approach using the CodexGlue dataset, comparing several models, including CodeT5, CodeBERT, and GraphCodeBERT, to assess the effectiveness of combining symbolic reasoning and prompting techniques with LLMs. Our results show that this approach improves the accuracy and efficiency of automated code review.",

        "abstract": "Adversarial attacks in 3D environments have emerged as a critical threat to the reliability of visual perception systems, particularly in safety-sensitive applications such as identity verification and autonomous driving. These attacks employ adversarial patches and 3D objects to manipulate deep neural network (DNN) predictions by exploiting vulnerabilities within complex scenes. Existing defense mechanisms, such as adversarial training and purification, primarily employ passive strategies to enhance robustness. However, these approaches often rely on pre-defined assumptions about adversarial tactics, limiting their adaptability in dynamic 3D settings. To address these challenges, we introduce Reinforced Embodied Active Defense (Rein-EAD), a proactive defense framework that leverages adaptive exploration and interaction with the environment to improve perception robustness in 3D adversarial contexts. By implementing a multi-step objective that balances immediate prediction accuracy with predictive entropy minimization, Rein-EAD optimizes defense strategies over a multi-step horizon. Additionally, Rein-EAD involves an uncertainty-oriented reward-shaping mechanism that facilitates efficient policy updates, thereby reducing computational overhead and supporting real-world applicability without the need for differentiable environments. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of Rein-EAD, demonstrating a substantial reduction in attack success rates while preserving standard accuracy across diverse tasks. Notably, Rein-EAD exhibits robust generalization to unseen and adaptive attacks, making it suitable for real-world complex tasks, including 3D object classification, face recognition and autonomous driving.",

We propose a novel indicator allowing quantitative comparison of models across SAE features, and use it to conduct a comparative study of visual, textual and multimodal encoders. We also propose to quantify the Comparative Sharedness of individual features between different classes of models. With these two new tools, we conduct several studies on 21 encoders of the three types, with two significantly different sizes, and considering generalist and domain specific datasets. The results allow to revisit previous studies at the light of encoders trained in a multimodal context and to quantify to which extent all these models share some representations or features. They also suggest that visual features that are specific to VLMs among vision encoders are shared with text encoders, highlighting the impact of text pretraining.

GLANCE combines a logic layer for interpretable and structured embeddings, multi-head attention-based edge pruning for denoising graph structures, and clustering mechanisms for capturing global patterns.

The dataset comprises 103K video samples (3K reserved for testing), each paired with audio and systematically detailed textual descriptions. Specifically, every video and its audio is described across three hierarchical layers (factual, abstract, and intent), progressing from surface to depth. It contains over 22 million words, averaging ~225 words per sample. VideoMind's key distinction from existing datasets is its provision of intent expressions, which require contextual integration across the entire video and are not directly observable. These deep-cognitive expressions are generated using a Chain-of-Thought (COT) approach, prompting the mLLM through step-by-step reasoning. Each description includes annotations for subject, place, time, event, action, and intent, supporting downstream recognition tasks. Crucially, we establish a gold-standard benchmark with 3,000 manually validated samples for evaluating deep-cognitive video understanding. We design hybrid-cognitive retrieval experiments, scored by multi-level retrieval metrics, to appropriately assess deep video comprehension. Evaluation results for models (e.g., InternVideo, VAST, UMT-L) are released. VideoMind serves as a powerful benchmark for fine-grained cross-modal alignment and advances fields requiring in-depth video understanding, such as emotion and intent recognition.

This urgency is reflected by the global emergence of AI regulations that emphasise fairness and adequate testing, with some mandating independent bias audits. However, procuring the necessary data for fairness testing remains a significant challenge. Particularly in industry settings, legal and privacy concerns restrict the collection of demographic data required to assess group disparities, and auditors face practical and cultural challenges in gaining access to data. Further, internal historical datasets are often insufficiently representative to identify real-world biases. This work focuses on evaluating classifier fairness when complete datasets including demographics are inaccessible. We propose leveraging separate overlapping datasets to construct complete synthetic data that includes demographic information and accurately reflects the underlying relationships between protected attributes and model features. We validate the fidelity of the synthetic data by comparing it to real data, and empirically demonstrate that fairness metrics derived from testing on such synthetic data are consistent with those obtained from real data. This work, therefore, offers a path to overcome real-world data scarcity for fairness testing, enabling independent, model-agnostic evaluation of fairness, and serving as a viable substitute where real data is limited.",

These challenges have spurred the emergence of Financial Foundation Models (FFMs) - a new class of models explicitly designed for finance. This survey presents a comprehensive overview of FFMs, with a taxonomy spanning three key modalities: Financial Language Foundation Models (FinLFMs), Financial Time-Series Foundation Models (FinTSFMs), and Financial Visual-Language Foundation Models (FinVLFMs). We review their architectures, training methodologies, datasets, and real-world applications. Furthermore, we identify critical challenges in data availability, algorithmic scalability, and infrastructure constraints, and offer insights into future research opportunities.

        "abstract": "Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are pivotal in clinical practices, yet their retrieval remains a challenge mainly due to semantic gap issues. Recent advancements in dense retrieval offer promising solutions but existing models, both general-domain and biomedical-domain, fall short due to insufficient medical knowledge or mismatched training corpora. This paper introduces \\texttt{this http URL}, a series of dense retrieval models specifically tailored for EHR retrieval. We propose a two-stage training pipeline utilizing MIMIC-IV discharge summaries to address the need for extensive medical knowledge and large-scale training data. The first stage involves medical entity extraction and knowledge injection from a biomedical knowledge graph, while the second stage employs large language models to generate diverse training data. We train two variants of \\texttt{this http URL}, with 110M and 7B parameters, respectively. Evaluated on the CliniQ benchmark, our models significantly outperforms all existing dense retrievers, achieving state-of-the-art results. Detailed analyses confirm our models' superiority across various match and query types, particularly in challenging semantic matches like implication and abbreviation. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each pipeline component, and supplementary experiments on EHR QA datasets demonstrate the models' generalizability on natural language questions, including complex ones with multiple entities. This work significantly advances EHR retrieval, offering a robust solution for clinical applications.",

Existing approaches typically rely on data synthesis methods and yield promising results by using unlabeled data to capture domain-specific features. However, these methods either incur high computational costs or suffer from performance limitations, while also demonstrating insufficient generalization across different tasks. To address these challenges, we propose AQuilt, a framework for constructing instruction-tuning data for any specialized domains from corresponding unlabeled data, including Answer, Question, Unlabeled data, Inspection, Logic, and Task type. By incorporating logic and inspection, we encourage reasoning processes and self-inspection to enhance model performance. Moreover, customizable task instructions enable high-quality data generation for any task. As a result, we construct a dataset of 703k examples to train a powerful data synthesis model. Experiments show that AQuilt is comparable to DeepSeek-V3 while utilizing just 17% of the production cost. Further analysis demonstrates that our generated data exhibits higher relevance to downstream tasks. Source code, models, and scripts are available at this https URL.",

However, training such a model requires high-quality, local datasets at the deployment site, which are often difficult to collect. We propose a transformer-based foundation model for mMIMO precoding that seeks to minimize the energy consumption of the transmitter while dynamically adapting to per-user rate requirements. At equal energy consumption, zero-shot deployment of the proposed foundation model significantly outperforms zero forcing, and approaches weighted minimum mean squared error performance with 8x less complexity. To address model adaptation in data-scarce settings, we introduce a data augmentation method that finds training samples similar to the target distribution by computing the cosine similarity between the outputs of the pre-trained feature extractor. Our work enables the implementation of DL-based solutions in practice by addressing challenges of data availability and training complexity. Moreover, the ability to dynamically configure per-user rate requirements can be leveraged by higher level resource allocation and scheduling algorithms for greater control over energy efficiency, spectral efficiency and fairness.",

        "abstract": "Zero-shot Image Captioning (ZIC) increasingly utilizes synthetic datasets generated by text-to-image (T2I) models to mitigate the need for costly manual annotation. However, these T2I models often produce images that exhibit semantic misalignments with their corresponding input captions (e.g., missing objects, incorrect attributes), resulting in noisy synthetic image-caption pairs that can hinder model training. Existing dataset pruning techniques are largely designed for removing noisy text in web-crawled data. However, these methods are ill-suited for the distinct challenges of synthetic data, where captions are typically well-formed, but images may be inaccurate representations. To address this gap, we introduce SynC, a novel framework specifically designed to refine synthetic image-caption datasets for ZIC. Instead of conventional filtering or regeneration, SynC focuses on reassigning captions to the most semantically aligned images already present within the synthetic image pool. Our approach employs a one-to-many mapping strategy by initially retrieving multiple relevant candidate images for each caption. We then apply a cycle-consistency-inspired alignment scorer that selects the best image by verifying its ability to retrieve the original caption via image-to-text retrieval. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that SynC consistently and significantly improves performance across various ZIC models on standard benchmarks (MS-COCO, Flickr30k, NoCaps), achieving state-of-the-art results in several scenarios. SynC offers an effective strategy for curating refined synthetic data to enhance ZIC.",

In this paper, we introduce \\textit{Moving Out}, a new human-AI collaboration benchmark that resembles a wide range of collaboration modes affected by physical attributes and constraints, such as moving heavy items together and maintaining consistent actions to move a big item around a corner. Using Moving Out, we designed two tasks and collected human-human interaction data to evaluate models' abilities to adapt to diverse human behaviors and unseen physical attributes. To address the challenges in physical environments, we propose a novel method, BASS (Behavior Augmentation, Simulation, and Selection), to enhance the diversity of agents and their understanding of the outcome of actions.

While existing work has made remarkable success in automated 2D software generation, such as HTML/CSS and mobile app interface code synthesis, the generation of 3D software still remains under-explored. Current methods for 3D software generation usually generate the 3D environments as a whole and cannot modify or control specific elements in the software. Furthermore, these methods struggle to handle the complex spatial and semantic constraints inherent in the real world. To address the challenges, we present Scenethesis, a novel requirement-sensitive 3D software synthesis approach that maintains formal traceability between user specifications and generated 3D software. Scenethesis is built upon ScenethesisLang, a domain-specific language that serves as a granular constraint-aware intermediate representation (IR) to bridge natural language requirements and executable 3D software. It serves both as a comprehensive scene description language enabling fine-grained modification of 3D software elements and as a formal constraint-expressive specification language capable of expressing complex spatial constraints. By decomposing 3D software synthesis into stages operating on ScenethesisLang, Scenethesis enables independent verification, targeted modification, and systematic constraint satisfaction. Our evaluation demonstrates that Scenethesis accurately captures over 80% of user requirements and satisfies more than 90% of hard constraints while handling over 100 constraints simultaneously. Furthermore, Scenethesis achieves a 42.8% improvement in BLIP-2 visual evaluation scores compared to the state-of-the-art method.",

        "abstract": "Zero-shot domain adaptation is a method for adapting a model to a target domain without utilizing target domain image data. To enable adaptation without target images, existing studies utilize CLIP's embedding space and text description to simulate target-like style features. Despite the previous achievements in zero-shot domain adaptation, we observe that these text-driven methods struggle to capture complex real-world variations and significantly increase adaptation time due to their alignment process. Instead of relying on text descriptions, we explore solutions leveraging image data, which provides diverse and more fine-grained style cues. In this work, we propose SIDA, a novel and efficient zero-shot domain adaptation method leveraging synthetic images. To generate synthetic images, we first create detailed, source-like images and apply image translation to reflect the style of the target domain. We then utilize the style features of these synthetic images as a proxy for the target domain. Based on these features, we introduce Domain Mix and Patch Style Transfer modules, which enable effective modeling of real-world variations. In particular, Domain Mix blends multiple styles to expand the intra-domain representations, and Patch Style Transfer assigns different styles to individual patches. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by showing state-of-the-art performance in diverse zero-shot adaptation scenarios, particularly in challenging domains. Moreover, our approach achieves high efficiency by significantly reducing the overall adaptation time.",
