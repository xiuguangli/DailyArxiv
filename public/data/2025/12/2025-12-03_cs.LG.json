        "abstract": "Diabetes is a serious worldwide health issue, and successful intervention depends on early detection. However, overlapping risk factors and data asymmetry make prediction difficult. To use extensive health survey data to create a machine learning framework for diabetes classification that is both accurate and comprehensible, to produce results that will aid in clinical decision-making. Using the BRFSS dataset, we assessed a number of supervised learning techniques. SMOTE and Tomek Links were used to correct class imbalance. To improve prediction performance, both individual models and ensemble techniques such as stacking were investigated. The 2015 BRFSS dataset, which includes roughly 253,680 records with 22 numerical features, is used in this study. Strong ROC-AUC performance of approximately 0.96 was attained by the individual models Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, and this http URL stacking ensemble with XGBoost and KNN yielded the best overall results with 94.82\\% accuracy, ROC-AUC of 0.989, and PR-AUC of 0.991, indicating a favourable balance between recall and precision. In our study, we proposed and developed a React Native-based application with a Python Flask backend to support early diabetes prediction, providing users with an accessible and efficient health monitoring tool.",

        "abstract": "Ligand-based drug discovery (LBDD) relies on making use of known binders to a protein target to find structurally diverse molecules similarly likely to bind. This process typically involves a brute force search of the known binder (query) against a molecular library using some metric of molecular similarity. One popular approach overlays the pharmacophore-shape profile of the known binder to 3D conformations enumerated for each of the library molecules, computes overlaps, and picks a set of diverse library molecules with high overlaps. While this virtual screening workflow has had considerable success in hit diversification, scaffold hopping, and patent busting, it scales poorly with library sizes and restricts candidate generation to existing library compounds. Leveraging recent advances in voxel-based generative modelling, we propose a pharmacophore-based generative model and workflows that address the scaling and fecundity issues of conventional pharmacophore-based virtual screening. We introduce \\emph{VoxCap}, a voxel captioning method for generating SMILES strings from voxelised molecular representations. We propose two workflows as practical use cases as well as benchmarks for pharmacophore-based generation: \\emph{de-novo} design, in which we aim to generate new molecules with high pharmacophore-shape similarities to query molecules, and fast search, which aims to combine generative design with a cheap 2D substructure similarity search for efficient hit identification. Our results show that VoxCap significantly outperforms previous methods in generating diverse \\textit{de-novo} hits. When combined with our fast search workflow, VoxCap reduces computational time by orders of magnitude while returning hits for all query molecules, enabling the search of large libraries that are intractable to search by brute force.",

The procedure first consists in determining the solution trace on the boundaries of the domain by solving a boundary integral equation, after which the volumetric solution can be recovered at low computational cost with a boundary integral representation. As the first step of the BEM represents the main computational bottleneck, we introduce PIBNet, a learning-based approach designed to approximate the solution trace. The method leverages a physics-inspired graph-based strategy to model obstacles and their long-range interactions efficiently. Then, we introduce a novel multiscale graph neural network architecture for simulating the multiple scattering. To train and evaluate our network, we present a benchmark consisting of several datasets of different types of multiple scattering problems.

I propose the SFL Transformer, a novel deep learning model that utilizes a Contextual Gating mechanism (an Intermediate SFL) to modulate the sequence of hidden states within the BERT encoder stack, rather than fusing features at the final output layer. This approach modulates the deep, contextualized semantic features (Hseq) using low-dimensional structural cues (Fstruct). The model is applied to a challenging binary classification task derived from UMAP-reduced lyrical embeddings. The SFL Transformer achieved an Accuracy of 0.9910 and a Macro F1 score of 0.9910, significantly improving the state-of-the-art established by the previously published SFL model (Accuracy 0.9894). Crucially, this Contextual Gating strategy maintained exceptional reliability, with a low Expected Calibration Error (ECE = 0.0081) and Log Loss (0.0489). This work validates the hypothesis that injecting auxiliary context mid-stack is the most effective means of synergistically combining structural and semantic information, creating a model with both superior discriminative power and high-fidelity probability estimates.",

However, the dominant frequencies in time series may shift with the evolving spectral distribution of the data. Traditional Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, which employ a fixed number of experts, struggle to adapt to these changes, resulting in frequency coverage imbalance issue. Specifically, too few experts can lead to the overlooking of critical information, while too many can introduce noise. To this end, we propose Ada-MoGE, an adaptive Gaussian Mixture of Experts model. Ada-MoGE integrates spectral intensity and frequency response to adaptively determine the number of experts, ensuring alignment with the input data's frequency distribution. This approach prevents both information loss due to an insufficient number of experts and noise contamination from an excess of experts. Additionally, to prevent noise introduction from direct band truncation, we employ Gaussian band-pass filtering to smoothly decompose the frequency domain features, further optimizing the feature representation. The experimental results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on six public benchmarks with only 0.2 million parameters.",

To remedy this issue, we introduce Hierarchical Topological Granularity Graph Contrastive Learning (HTG-GCL), a novel framework that leverages transformations of the same graph to generate multi-scale ring-based cellular complexes, embodying the concept of topological granularity, thereby generating diverse topological views. Recognizing that a certain granularity may contain misleading semantics, we propose a multi-granularity decoupled contrast and apply a granularity-specific weighting mechanism based on uncertainty estimation. Comprehensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of HTG-GCL, highlighting its superior performance in capturing meaningful graph representations through hierarchical topological information.",

This paper offers a thorough analysis of four pricing algorithms -- Q-Learning, PSO, Double DQN, and DDPG -- across three classic duopoly models (Logit, Hotelling, Linear) and under various demand-shock regimes created by auto-regressive processes. By utilizing profit- and price-based collusion indices, we investigate how the interactions among algorithms, market structure, and stochastic demand collaboratively influence competitive outcomes. Our findings reveal that reinforcement-learning algorithms often sustain supra-competitive prices under stable demand, with DDPG demonstrating the most pronounced collusive tendencies. Demand shocks produce notably varied effects: Logit markets suffer significant performance declines, Hotelling markets remain stable, and Linear markets experience shock-induced profit inflation. Despite marked changes in absolute performance, the relative rankings of the algorithms are consistent across different environments. These results underscore the critical importance of market structure and demand uncertainty in shaping algorithmic competition, while also contributing to the evolving policy discussions surrounding autonomous pricing behavior.",

While it is known that improving fairness can affect predictive performance, little is known about how fairness improvements influence explainability, an essential ingredient for clinical trust. Clinicians may hesitate to rely on a model whose explanations shift after fairness constraints are applied. In this study, we examine how enhancing fairness through bias mitigation techniques reshapes Shapley-based feature rankings. We quantify changes in feature importance rankings after applying fairness constraints across three datasets: pediatric urinary tract infection risk, direct anticoagulant bleeding risk, and recidivism risk. We also evaluate multiple model classes on the stability of Shapley-based rankings. We find that increasing model fairness across racial subgroups can significantly alter feature importance rankings, sometimes in different ways across groups.

We show that in the \\emph{testable learning} model of Rubinfeld and Vasilyan [RV23], membership queries cannot decrease the time complexity of testable learning algorithms beyond the complexity of sample-only distribution-specific learning. In the testable learning model, the learner must output a hypothesis whenever the data distribution satisfies a desired property, and if it outputs a hypothesis, the hypothesis must be near-optimal. We give a general reduction from sample-based \\emph{refutation} of boolean concept classes, as presented in [Vadhan17, KL18], to testable learning with queries (TL-Q). This yields lower bounds for TL-Q via the reduction from learning to refutation given in [KL18]. The result is that, relative to a concept class and a distribution family, no $m$-sample TL-Q algorithm can be super-polynomially more time-efficient than the best $m$-sample PAC learner. Finally, we define a class of ``statistical'' MQ algorithms that encompasses many known distribution-specific MQ learners, such as those based on influence estimation or subcube-conditional statistical queries. We show that TL-Q algorithms in this class imply efficient statistical-query refutation and learning algorithms. Thus, combined with known SQ dimension lower bounds, our results imply that these efficient membership query learners cannot be made testable.",

We focus our empirical investigation to 3D-rotation equivariance on high-dimensional molecular tasks (flow matching, force field prediction, denoising voxels) and find that models reduce equivariance error quickly to $\\leq$2\\% held-out loss within 1k-10k training steps, a result robust to model and dataset size. This happens because learning 3D-rotational equivariance is an easier learning task, with a smoother and better-conditioned loss landscape, than the main prediction task. For 3D rotations, the loss penalty for non-equivariant models is small throughout training, so they may achieve lower test loss than equivariant models per GPU-hour unless the equivariant ``efficiency gap'' is narrowed. We also experimentally and theoretically investigate the relationships between relative equivariance error, learning gradients, and model parameters.",

More accurate learning typically requires Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Boltzmann sampling, but it is time-consuming due to the difficulty of parallelization for more expressive models. To address this limitation, we first propose a new Boltzmann sampler inspired by a quantum-inspired combinatorial optimization called simulated bifurcation (SB). This SB-inspired approach, which we name Langevin SB (LSB), enables parallelized sampling while maintaining accuracy comparable to MCMC. Furthermore, this is applicable not only to RBMs but also to BMs with general couplings. However, LSB cannot control the inverse temperature of the output Boltzmann distribution, which hinders learning and degrades performance. To overcome this limitation, we also developed an efficient method for estimating the inverse temperature during the learning process, which we call conditional expectation matching (CEM). By combining LSB and CEM, we establish an efficient learning framework for BMs with greater expressive power than RBMs. We refer to this framework as sampler-adaptive learning (SAL). SAL opens new avenues for energy-based generative modeling beyond RBMs.",

We study online classification in non-stationary environments and propose Retrieval-Augmented Memory for Online Learning (RAM-OL), a simple extension of stochastic gradient descent that maintains a small buffer of past examples. At each time step, RAM-OL retrieves a few nearest neighbours of the current input in the hidden representation space and updates the model jointly on the current example and the retrieved neighbours. We compare a naive replay variant with a gated replay variant that constrains neighbours using a time window, similarity thresholds, and gradient reweighting, in order to balance fast reuse of relevant past data against robustness to outdated regimes. From a theoretical perspective, we interpret RAM-OL under a bounded drift model and discuss how retrieval can reduce adaptation cost and improve regret constants when patterns recur over time. Empirically, we instantiate RAM-OL on a simple online multilayer perceptron and evaluate it on three real-world data streams derived from electricity pricing, electricity load, and airline delay data. On strongly and periodically drifting streams, RAM-OL improves prequential accuracy by up to about seven percentage points and greatly reduces variance across random seeds, while on a noisy airline stream the gated variant closely matches the purely online baseline. These results show that retrieval-augmented memory is a practical and robust tool for online learning under concept drift.",

To further understand this phenomenon, this paper compares the performance of existing and unique methods to determine the best approach in predicting gated station entries in the subway system (a proxy for subway usage) and the number of delays in the overall MBTA system. To do so, this research considers factors that tend to affect public transportation, such as day of week, season, pressure, wind speed, average temperature, and precipitation. This paper evaluates the performance of 10 statistical and machine learning models on predicting next-day subway usage. On predicting delay count, the number of models is extended to 11 per day by introducing a self-exciting point process model, representing a unique application of a point-process framework for MBTA delay modeling. This research involves experimenting with the selective inclusion of features to determine feature importance, testing model accuracy via Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Remarkably, it is found that providing either day of week or season data has a more substantial benefit to predictive accuracy compared to weather data; in fact, providing weather data generally worsens performance, suggesting a tendency of models to overfit.",

However, we find that as the context length grows, verification becomes the dominant bottleneck. To further accelerate speculative decoding in long-context generation, we introduce SpecPV, a self-speculative decoding approach that performs fast verification using partial key-value states (KV) and periodically applies full verification to eliminate accumulated errors. We validate SpecPV across multiple long-context benchmarks and models, including LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct and Qwen3-series.

It exploits a \\emph{vote mechanism} to identify high-return actions during local policy evaluation, alleviating the negative effect of low-quality behaviors from diverse local learning policies. Besides, building on advantage-weighted regression (AWR), we construct consistent local and global training objectives, significantly enhancing the efficiency and stability of FOVA. Further, we conduct an extensive theoretical analysis and rigorously show that the policy learned by FOVA enjoys strict policy improvement over the behavioral policy.

        "abstract": "Transformers, composed of QKV generation, attention computation, and FFNs, have become the dominant model across various domains due to their outstanding performance. However, their high computational cost hinders efficient hardware deployment. Sparsity offers a promising solution, yet most existing accelerators exploit only intra-row sparsity in attention, while few consider inter-row sparsity. Approaches leveraging inter-row sparsity often rely on costly global similarity estimation, which diminishes the acceleration benefits of sparsity, and typically apply sparsity to only one or two transformer components. Through careful analysis of the attention distribution and computation flow, we observe that local similarity allows end-to-end sparse acceleration with lower computational overhead. Motivated by this observation, we propose ESACT, an end-to-end sparse accelerator for compute-intensive Transformers. ESACT centers on the Sparsity Prediction with Local Similarity (SPLS) mechanism, which leverages HLog quantization to accurately predict local attention sparsity prior to QK generation, achieving efficient sparsity across all transformer components. To support efficient hardware realization, we introduce three architectural innovations. Experimental results on 26 benchmarks demonstrate that SPLS reduces total computation by 52.03% with less than 1% accuracy loss. ESACT achieves an end-to-end energy efficiency of 3.29 TOPS/W, and improves attention-level energy efficiency by 2.95x and 2.26x over SOTA attention accelerators SpAtten and Sanger, respectively.",

        "abstract": "With increased travelling needs more than ever, traffic congestion has become a major concern in most urban areas. Allocating spaces for on-street parking, further hinders traffic flow, by limiting the effective road width available for driving. With the advancement of vehicle-to-infrastructure connectivity technologies, we explore how the impact of on-street parking on traffic congestion could be minimized, by dynamically configuring on-street parking spaces. Towards that end, we formulate dynamic on-street parking space configuration as an optimization problem, and we follow a data driven approach, considering the nature of our problem. Our proposed solution comprises a two-layer multi agent reinforcement learning based framework, which is inherently scalable to large road networks. The lane level agents are responsible for deciding the optimal parking space configuration for each lane, and we introduce a novel Deep Q-learning architecture which effectively utilizes long short term memory networks and graph attention networks to capture the spatio-temporal correlations evident in the given problem. The block level agents control the actions of the lane level agents and maintain a sufficient level of parking around the block. We conduct a set of comprehensive experiments using SUMO, on both synthetic data as well as real-world data from the city of Melbourne. Our experiments show that the proposed framework could reduce the average travel time loss of vehicles significantly, reaching upto 47%, with a negligible increase in the walking distance for parking.",

        "abstract": "Cross-Domain Offline Reinforcement Learning aims to train an agent deployed in the target environment, leveraging both a limited target domain dataset and a source domain dataset with (possibly) sufficient data coverage. Due to the underlying dynamics misalignment between the source and target domain, simply merging the data from two datasets may incur inferior performance. Recent advances address this issue by selectively sharing source domain samples that exhibit dynamics alignment with the target domain. However, these approaches focus solely on dynamics alignment and overlook \\textit{value alignment}, i.e., selecting high-quality, high-value samples from the source domain. In this paper, we first demonstrate that both dynamics alignment and value alignment are essential for policy learning, by examining the limitations of the current theoretical framework for cross-domain RL and establishing a concrete sub-optimality gap of a policy trained on the source domain and evaluated on the target domain. Motivated by the theoretical insights, we propose to selectively share those source domain samples with both high dynamics and value alignment and present our \\textbf{\\underline{D}}ynamics- and \\textbf{\\underline{V}}alue-aligned \\textbf{\\underline{D}}ata \\textbf{\\underline{F}}iltering (DVDF) method.

We find that LLM agents could be sensitive to length, type, and placement of the context, exhibiting unexpected and inconsistent shifts in task performance and in refusals to execute harmful requests. Models with 1M-2M token context windows show severe degradation already at 100K tokens, with performance drops exceeding 50\\% for both benign and harmful tasks.

Our work shows potential safety issues with agents operating on longer context and opens additional questions on the current metrics and paradigm for evaluating LLM agent safety on long multi-step tasks.

Commercial Microwave Links (CMLs) are an emerging data source with great potential for this this http URL traditional rainfall retrieval from CMLs relies on physicsbased models, these often struggle with real-world complexities like signal noise and nonlinear attenuation. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel hybrid deep learning architecture based on the Transformer and a Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU), which we name TabGRU. This design synergistically captures both long-term dependencies and local sequential features in the CML signal data. The model is further enhanced by a learnable positional embedding and an attention pooling mechanism to improve its dynamic feature extraction and generalization capabilities. The model was validated on a public benchmark dataset from Gothenburg, Sweden (June-September 2015). The evaluation used 12 sub-links from two rain gauges (Torp and Barl) over a test period (August 22-31) covering approximately 10 distinct rainfall events. The proposed TabGRU model demonstrated consistent advantages, outperforming deep learning baselines and achieving high coefficients of determination (R2) at both the Torp site (0.91) and the Barl site (0.96). Furthermore, compared to the physics-based approach, TabGRU maintained higher accuracy and was particularly effective in mitigating the significant overestimation problem observed in the PL model during peak rainfall events. This evaluation confirms that the TabGRU model can effectively overcome the limitations of traditional methods, providing a robust and accurate solution for CML-based urban rainfall monitoring under the tested conditions.",

In this paper, we investigate dual (both train-time and test-time) robustness against dynamics shifts in cross-domain offline RL. We first empirically show that the policy trained with cross-domain offline RL exhibits fragility under dynamics perturbations during evaluation, particularly when target domain data is limited. To address this, we introduce a novel robust cross-domain Bellman (RCB) operator, which enhances test-time robustness against dynamics perturbations while staying conservative to the out-of-distribution dynamics transitions, thus guaranteeing the train-time robustness. To further counteract potential value overestimation or underestimation caused by the RCB operator, we introduce two techniques, the dynamic value penalty and the Huber loss, into our framework, resulting in the practical \\textbf{D}ual-\\textbf{RO}bust \\textbf{C}ross-domain \\textbf{O}ffline RL (DROCO) algorithm.

In federated learning (FL) in its naive form, often biases toward certain users, and a single global model fails to capture the statistical heterogeneity across users and BSs. In contrast, the proposed DMTFL algorithm personalizes content delivery by learning individual caching models at each BS. These models are further optimized to perform well under any target distribution, while providing theoretical guarantees via Rademacher complexity and a probably approximately correct (PAC) bound on the loss.

However, executing agents at scale using high-capacity LLMs incurs high inference costs. We propose a simple method for reducing LLM agent inference costs without incurring the development friction costs associated with LLM fine-tuning (long training cycles, optimization hyperparameter tweaking loops) or manual prompt engineering (laborious trial and error). Most importantly, we introduce $\\textit{in-context distillation}$, which adapts the idea of knowledge distillation (training a low cost-student model to mimic a high-cost teacher) to an in-context learning setting. Our approach retrieves relevant teacher demonstrations at each agent step and provides them to the student as in-context examples, enabling the student to imitate teacher behavior on-the-fly. We combine in-context distillation with the established idea of $\\textit{self-consistency cascades}$ to know when the trust the student. This adaptive strategy realizes the cost benefits of model specialization while preserving the productivity of working with frozen models. On the multi-step embodied reasoning benchmark ALFWorld, our method matches teacher-level accuracy at $\\textbf{2.5$\\times$ lower cost}$, reducing per-episode costs from \\$0.059 to \\$0.024. The upfront demonstration cost amortizes after just 843 episodes, yielding cumulative savings exceeding \\$34,900 at deployment scale (1M episodes). On AppWorld, a complex agent benchmark requiring multi-step API workflows, we shift the Pareto frontier by achieving a $\\textbf{2$\\times$ cost reduction}$ at iso-accuracy. By reducing operational costs while maintaining rapid experimentation cycles with frozen models, our approach makes advanced agentic systems economically viable for a broader range of applications.",

In this paper, we introduce the Feature Learning (FL) model, which addresses this issue by representing tensor-product features as a learnable Canonical Polyadic Decomposition (CPD). By leveraging this CPD structure, we efficiently learn the hyperparameters associated with different features alongside the model parameters using an Alternating Least Squares (ALS) optimization method. We prove the effectiveness of the FL model through experiments on real data of various dimensionality and scale. The results show that the FL model can be consistently trained 3-5 times faster than and have the prediction quality on par with a standard cross-validated model.",

        "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) faces a persistent tension: policies that are stable to optimize are often too simple to represent the multimodal action distributions needed for complex control. Gaussian policies provide tractable likelihoods and smooth gradients, but their unimodal form limits expressiveness. Conversely, generative policies based on diffusion or flow matching can model rich multimodal behaviors; however, in online RL, they are frequently unstable due to intractable likelihoods and noisy gradients propagating through deep sampling chains. We address this tension with a key structural principle: decoupling optimization from generation. Building on this insight, we introduce GoRL (Generative Online Reinforcement Learning), a framework that optimizes a tractable latent policy while utilizing a conditional generative decoder to synthesize actions. A two-timescale update schedule enables the latent policy to learn stably while the decoder steadily increases expressiveness, without requiring tractable action likelihoods. Across a range of continuous-control tasks, GoRL consistently outperforms both Gaussian policies and recent generative-policy baselines. Notably, on the HopperStand task, it reaches a normalized return above 870, more than 3 times that of the strongest baseline. These results demonstrate that separating optimization from generation provides a practical path to policies that are both stable and highly expressive.",

        "abstract": "Heat transfer in semiconductor devices is dominated by chip and substrate assemblies, where heat generated within a finite chip layer dissipates into a semi-infinite substrate with much higher thermophysical properties. This mismatch produces steep interfacial temperature gradients, making the transient thermal response highly sensitive to the interface. Conventional numerical solvers require excessive discretization to resolve these dynamics, while physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) often exhibit unstable convergence and loss of physical consistency near the material interface. To address these challenges, we introduce HeatTransFormer, a physics-guided Transformer architecture for interface-dominated diffusion problems. The framework integrates physically informed spatiotemporal sampling, a Laplace-based activation emulating analytical diffusion solutions, and a mask-free attention mechanism supporting bidirectional spatiotemporal coupling. These components enable the model to resolve steep gradients, maintain physical consistency, and remain stable where PINNs typically fail. HeatTransFormer produces coherent temperature fields across the interface when applied to a finite layer and semi-infinite substrate configuration. Coupled with a physics-constrained inverse strategy, it further enables reliable identification of three unknown thermal properties simultaneously using only external measurements. Overall, this work demonstrates that physics-guided Transformer architectures provide a unified framework for forward and inverse modeling in interface-dominated thermal systems.",

In this work, we propose an efficient transfer learning method using a tensor kernel machine. Our method takes inspiration from the adaptive SVM and hence transfers 'knowledge' from the source to the 'adapted' model via regularization. The main advantage of using tensor kernel machines is that they leverage low-rank tensor networks to learn a compact non-linear model in the primal domain. This allows for a more efficient adaptation without adding more parameters to the model. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we apply the adaptive tensor kernel machine (Adapt-TKM) to seizure detection on behind-the-ear EEG. By personalizing patient-independent models with a small amount of patient-specific data, the patient-adapted model (which utilizes the Adapt-TKM), achieves better performance compared to the patient-independent and fully patient-specific models. Notably, it is able to do so while requiring around 100 times fewer parameters than the adaptive SVM model, leading to a correspondingly faster inference speed. This makes the Adapt-TKM especially useful for resource-constrained wearable devices.",

To address these limitations, a novel VLN agent framework, named SeeNav-Agent, is proposed in this work. First, to reduce perception hallucinations of the visual module of the VLN agent, a dual-view Visual Prompt (VP) technique is introduced in the input space, which can also improve the agent's understanding of current spatial states. Subsequently, a novel step-level Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) method, Step Reward Group Policy Optimization (SRGPO), is designed for the post-training of VLN agents. In SRGPO, we first define verifiable process rewards for the navigation task, and then perform efficient step-level advantage estimation by randomly grouping different navigation steps. SRGPO provides dense reward signals for the reinforcement learning process of the VLN agent and enhances its planning capability. Experimental results on the EmbodiedBench Navigation benchmark indicate that by introducing the zero-shot VP module, the GPT-4.1 achieves a navigation success rate of 86.7%, surpassing the current best LVLM by approximately 20 percentage points (pp). Through post-training based on SRGPO, the Qwen2.5-VL-3B model reaches a navigation success rate of 72.3%, outperforming the best existing LVLM model by 5.6 pp. Moreover, compared to RFT algorithms such as GRPO and GiGPO, the proposed SRGPO demonstrates significant improvements in training stability, convergence efficiency, and generalization capability.",

In this work, we introduce the Graph VQ-Transformer (GVT), a two-stage generative framework that achieves both high accuracy and efficiency. The core of our approach is a novel Graph Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) that compresses molecular graphs into high-fidelity discrete latent sequences. By synergistically combining a Graph Transformer with canonical Reverse Cuthill-McKee (RCM) node ordering and Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE), our VQ-VAE achieves near-perfect reconstruction rates. An autoregressive Transformer is then trained on these discrete latents, effectively converting graph generation into a well-structured sequence modeling problem. Crucially, this mapping of complex graphs to high-fidelity discrete sequences bridges molecular design with the powerful paradigm of large-scale sequence modeling, unlocking potential synergies with Large Language Models (LLMs). Extensive experiments show that GVT achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance across major benchmarks like ZINC250k, MOSES, and GuacaMol, and notably outperforms leading diffusion models on key distribution similarity metrics such as FCD and KL Divergence. With its superior performance, efficiency, and architectural novelty, GVT not only presents a compelling alternative to diffusion models but also establishes a strong new baseline for the field, paving the way for future research in discrete latent-space molecular generation.",

By assigning smaller rates to suspicious clients and larger rates to normal clients, aDFL mitigates the negative impact of abnormal clients on the global model in a fully adaptive way. Our theory does not put any stringent conditions on neighboring nodes and requires no prior knowledge. A rigorous convergence analysis is provided to guarantee the oracle property of aDFL. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the aDFL method.",

Similarly, data-driven architectures typically require large datasets to perform predictive tasks with sufficient accuracy. A possible approach to mitigate these challenges is the development of multi-fidelity emulators, leveraging potentially biased, inexpensive low-fidelity information while correcting and refining predictions using scarce, accurate high-fidelity data. This study investigates the performance of multi-fidelity neural emulators, neural networks designed to learn the input-to-output mapping by integrating limited high-fidelity data with abundant low-fidelity model solutions. We investigate the performance of such emulators for low and high-dimensional functions, with oscillatory character, in the presence of discontinuities, for collections of models with equal and dissimilar parametrization, and for a possibly large number of potentially corrupted low-fidelity sources. In doing so, we consider a large number of architectural, hyperparameter, and dataset configurations including networks with a different amount of spectral bias (Multi-Layered Perceptron, Siren and Kolmogorov Arnold Network), various mechanisms for coordinate encoding, exact or learnable low-fidelity information, and for varying training dataset size. We further analyze the added value of the multi-fidelity approach by conducting equivalent single-fidelity tests for each case, quantifying the performance gains achieved through fusing multiple sources of information.",

While complex-valued LLMs, such as iFairy, offer a superior chance for low-bit representation compared to real-valued counterparts, they require training from scratch, preventing the utilization of the vast ecosystem of pre-trained real-valued foundation models. Here we present Fairy2i, a universal framework that transforms pre-trained real-valued layers into an equivalent widely-linear complex form, enabling extremely low-bit quantization while reusing existing checkpoints. By proving a lossless mathematical equivalence between real and widely-linear maps, we convert standard Transformers into the complex domain and employ a phase-aware quantization scheme with a highly efficient codebook of fourth roots of unity. Furthermore, we introduce a recursive residual quantization mechanism that iteratively minimizes quantization error, allowing inference to proceed via efficient multiplication-free accumulation. We demonstrate that Fairy2i restores the performance of LLaMA-2 7B at an effective 2-bit precision to levels nearly comparable with full-precision baselines, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art real-valued binary and ternary quantization methods. This work bridges the gap between the representational efficiency of complex-valued arithmetic and the practical utility of pre-trained models, paving a new way for efficient inference on commodity hardware.",

We formulate this testing problem by introducing a notion of separation distance between general pairwise comparison models and the class of $\\mathcal{T}_F$ models. We then derive upper and lower bounds on the critical threshold for testing that depend on the topology of the observation graph. For the special case of complete observation graphs, this threshold scales as $\\Theta((nk)^{-1/2})$, where $n$ is the number of agents and $k$ is the number of comparisons per pair. Furthermore, we propose a hypothesis test based on our separation distance, construct confidence intervals, establish time-uniform bounds on the probabilities of type I and II errors using reverse martingale techniques, and derive minimax lower bounds using information-theoretic methods.

The Gaussian process model is a powerful tool commonly used in nonlinear regression applications. Standard regression modeling assumes random samples and an independently, identically distributed noise. Various fast approximations that speed up Gaussian process regression work under this standard setting. But for autocorrelated data, failing to account for autocorrelation leads to a phenomenon known as temporal overfitting that deteriorates model performance on new test instances. To handle autocorrelated data, existing fast Gaussian process approximations have to be modified; one such approach is to segment the originally correlated data points into blocks in which the blocked data are de-correlated. This work explains how to make some of the existing Gaussian process approximations work with blocked data. Numerical experiments across diverse application datasets demonstrate that the proposed approaches can remarkably accelerate computation for Gaussian process regression on autocorrelated data without compromising model prediction performance.",

To identify these geometric features, we use an interpolative decomposition pruning method on the weight matrices of the INR. The resulting pruned network is used to guide adaptive mesh refinement, enabling automatic mesh generation tailored to the underlying resolution of the function.

We validate our approach on synthetic datasets with ground truth motifs, and further test it on a real-world lung cancer spatial proteomics dataset. ProteinPNet consistently identifies biologically meaningful prototypes aligned with different tumor subtypes.

Our method models three-way preferences with a Bradley-Terry-Davidson formulation on rating counts, leveraging both polarity (margin among non-ties) and decisiveness (non-tie rate) to distinguish narrow margins from strong consensus. Across various evaluation benchmarks, our approach consistently reduces MAE and increases pairwise accuracy versus standard baselines, and when evaluated against human-consensus meta-labels, matches or exceeds individual human raters.

In this paper, we have developed a system that can detect the proper maintenance of that distance and people are properly using masks or not. We have used the customized attention-inceptionv3 model in this system for the identification of those two components. We have used two different datasets along with 10,800 images including both with and without Face Mask images. The training accuracy has been achieved 98% and validation accuracy 99.5%. The system can conduct a precision value of around 98.2% and the frame rate per second (FPS) was 25.0. So, with this system, we can identify high-risk areas with the highest possibility of the virus spreading zone. This may help authorities to take necessary steps to locate those risky areas and alert the local people to ensure proper precautions in no time.",

Furthermore, social context plays a critical role in understanding user behavior, yet is often overlooked in mobile sensing research. To address these gaps, we introduce LogMe, a mobile sensing application that passively collects smartphone sensor data (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, and rotation vector) and prompts users for hourly self-reports capturing both sedentary activity and social context. Using this dual-label dataset, we propose DySTAN (Dynamic Cross-Stitch with Task Attention Network), a multi-task learning framework that jointly classifies both context dimensions from shared sensor inputs. It integrates task-specific layers with cross-task attention to model subtle distinctions effectively. DySTAN improves sedentary activity macro F1 scores by 21.8% over a single-task CNN-BiLSTM-GRU (CBG) model and by 8.2% over the strongest multi-task baseline, Sluice Network (SN). These results demonstrate the importance of modeling multiple, co-occurring context dimensions to improve the accuracy and robustness of mobile context recognition.",

        "abstract": "Complex spatial connectivity patterns, such as interictal suppression and ictal propagation, complicate accurate drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) seizure detection using stereotactic electroencephalography (SEEG) and traditional machine learning methods. Two critical challenges remain:(1)a low signal-to-noise ratio in functional connectivity estimates, making it difficult to learn seizure-related interactions; and (2)expert labels for spatial pathological connectivity patterns are difficult to obtain, meanwhile lacking the patterns' representation to improve seizure detection. To address these issues, we propose a novel node-graph dual contrastive learning framework, Seizure-NGCLNet, to learn SEEG interictal suppression and ictal propagation patterns for detecting DRE seizures with high precision. First, an adaptive graph augmentation strategy guided by centrality metrics is developed to generate seizure-related brain networks. Second, a dual-contrastive learning approach is integrated, combining global graph-level contrast with local node-graph contrast, to encode both spatial structural and semantic epileptogenic features. Third, the pretrained embeddings are fine-tuned via a top-k localized graph attention network to perform the final classification. Extensive experiments on a large-scale public SEEG dataset from 33 DRE patients demonstrate that Seizure-NGCLNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an average accuracy of 95.93%, sensitivity of 96.25%, and specificity of 94.12%. Visualizations confirm that the learned embeddings clearly separate ictal from interictal states, reflecting suppression and propagation patterns that correspond to the clinical mechanisms. These results highlight Seizure-NGCLNet's ability to learn interpretable spatial pathological patterns, enhancing both seizure detection and seizure onset zone localization.",

POTFlow employs secondary structure information (e.g., helix, sheet, loop) as geometric constraints, which are further refined by optimal transport to produce shorter flow paths. With this design, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with five popular approaches. When applied to GBM, our method generates peptides that selectively inhibit cell viability and significantly prolong survival in a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model. As the first lead peptide-conditioned flow matching model, POTFlow holds strong potential as a generalizable framework for therapeutic peptide design.",

Our approach integrates Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks with algorithms based on decision trees, such as Random Forest and Gradient Boosting. While the former analyze price patterns of financial assets, the latter are fed with economic data of companies. Numerical simulations of algorithmic trading with data from international companies and 10-weekday predictions confirm that an approach based on both fundamental and technical variables can outperform the usual approaches, which do not combine those two types of variables.

However, these descriptive ('what-is') methods, while effective for identifying associations, are often insufficient for answering causal ('what-if') questions. Their application in such contexts often overlooks confounding and colliding variables, potentially leading to bias and suboptimal or incorrect decisions. We advocate for explicitly distinguishing descriptive from interventional questions in human-factor analysis, and applying causal inference frameworks specifically to these problems to prevent methodological mismatches. This approach disentangles complex variable relationships and enables counterfactual reasoning. Using post-occupancy evaluation (POE) data from the Center for the Built Environment's (CBE) Occupant Survey as a demonstration case, we show how causal discovery reveals intervention hierarchies and directional relationships that traditional associational analysis misses. The systematic distinction between causally associated and independent variables, combined with intervention prioritization capabilities, offers broad applicability to complex human-centric systems, for example, in building science or ergonomics, where understanding intervention effects is critical for optimization and decision-making.",

Unlike hybrid classical-quantum models, the proposed VQC operates independently during execution, eliminating latency from classical-quantum data exchange. The VQC is trained via supervised learning to map historical frequency deviations to optimal Proportional-Integral (PI) controller parameters using a pre-computed lookup table.

In this work, we present a hybrid Quantum-Classical Convolutional Neural Network (QCNN) architecture designed for the binary classification of the BreastMNIST dataset, a standardized benchmark for distinguishing between benign and malignant breast tumors. Our architecture integrates classical convolutional feature extraction with two distinct quantum circuits: an amplitude-encoding variational quantum circuit (VQC) and an angle-encoding VQC circuit with circular entanglement, both implemented on four qubits. These circuits generate quantum feature embeddings that are fused with classical features to form a joint feature space, which is subsequently processed by a fully connected classifier. To ensure fairness, the hybrid QCNN is parameter-matched against a baseline classical CNN, allowing us to isolate the contribution of quantum layers. Both models are trained under identical conditions using the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss. Experimental evaluation in five independent runs demonstrates that the hybrid QCNN achieves statistically significant improvements in classification accuracy compared to the classical CNN, as validated by a one-sided Wilcoxon signed rank test (p = 0.03125) and supported by large effect size of Cohen's d = 2.14. Our results indicate that hybrid QCNN architectures can leverage entanglement and quantum feature fusion to enhance medical image classification tasks. This work establishes a statistical validation framework for assessing hybrid quantum models in biomedical applications and highlights pathways for scaling to larger datasets and deployment on near-term quantum hardware.",

This paper proposes a novel quantum-classical hybrid algorithm that achieves, for the first time, the leap from \"quantum computation of Betti numbers\" to \"quantum acquisition of practical persistence diagrams.\" The algorithm leverages the LGZ quantum algorithm as an efficient feature extractor, mining the harmonic form eigenvectors of the combinatorial Laplacian as well as Betti numbers, constructing specialized topological kernel functions to train a quantum support vector machine (QSVM), and learning the mapping from quantum topological features to persistence diagrams. The core contributions of this algorithm are: (1) elevating quantum topological computation from statistical summaries to pattern recognition, greatly expanding its application value; (2) obtaining more practical topological information in the form of persistence diagrams for real-world applications while maintaining the exponential speedup advantage of quantum computation; (3) proposing a novel hybrid paradigm of \"classical precision guiding quantum efficiency.\" This method provides a feasible pathway for the practical implementation of quantum topological data analysis.",

We develop a real-time nowcasting framework for quarterly GDP growth using a high-dimensional panel of approximately 70 indicators, encompassing economic and financial indicators over 1990Q1-2023Q2. The analysis covers penalized regressions, dimensionality-reduction methods, ensemble learning algorithms, and neural architectures, benchmarked against a Random Walk, an AR(3), and a Dynamic Factor Model. The pipeline preserves temporal ordering through an expanding-window walk-forward design with Bayesian hyperparameter optimization, and uses moving block-bootstrap procedures both to construct prediction intervals and to obtain confidence bands for feature-importance measures. It adopts model-specific and XAI-based explainability tools. A Model Confidence Set procedure identifies statistically superior learners, which are then combined through simple, weighted, and exponentially weighted schemes; the resulting time-varying weights provide an interpretable representation of model contributions. Predictive ability is assessed via Giacomini-White tests. Empirical results show that penalized regressions, dimensionality-reduction models, and GRU networks consistently outperform all benchmarks, with RMSFE reductions of roughly 40-60%; aggregation delivers further gains. Feature-attribution methods highlight industrial production, external trade, and labor-market indicators as dominant drivers of Singapore's short-run growth dynamics.",

A natural strategy is to apply super-resolution (SR) to low-resolution (LR) input views, but independently enhancing each image introduces multi-view inconsistencies, leading to blurry renders. Prior methods attempt to mitigate these inconsistencies through learned neural components, temporally consistent video priors, or joint optimization on LR and SR views, but all uniformly apply SR across every image. In contrast, our key insight is that close-up LR views may contain high-frequency information for regions also captured in more distant views, and that we can use the camera pose relative to scene geometry to inform where to add SR content. Building from this insight, we propose SplatSuRe, a method that selectively applies SR content only in undersampled regions lacking high-frequency supervision, yielding sharper and more consistent results. Across Tanks & Temples, Deep Blending and Mip-NeRF 360, our approach surpasses baselines in both fidelity and perceptual quality.

The resulting structure has a natural metric that allows for the study of differential operators and stochastic processes on the graph. Brownian motions in these domains have been extensively studied theoretically using their generators. However, less work has been done on practical algorithms for simulating these processes. We introduce the first algorithm for simulating Brownian motions on metric graphs through a timestep splitting Euler-Maruyama-based discretization of their corresponding stochastic differential equation. By applying this scheme to Langevin diffusions on metric graphs, we also obtain the first algorithm for sampling on metric graphs. We provide theoretical guarantees on the number of timestep splittings required for the algorithm to converge to the underlying stochastic process. We also show that the exit probabilities of the simulated particle converge to the vertex-edge jump probabilities of the underlying stochastic differential equation as the timestep goes to zero. Finally, since this method is highly parallelizable, we provide fast, memory-aware implementations of our algorithm in the form of custom CUDA kernels that are up to ~8000x faster than a GPU implementation using PyTorch on simple star metric graphs. Beyond simple star graphs, we benchmark our algorithm on a real cortical vascular network extracted from a DuMuX tissue-perfusion model for tracer transport.

We introduce AV-SpeakerBench, a curated benchmark of 3,212 multiple-choice questions focused on speaker-centric audiovisual reasoning in real-world videos. It features: (1) a speaker-centered formulation that treats speakers-not scenes-as the core reasoning unit; (2) fusion-grounded question design embedding audiovisual dependencies into question semantics; and (3) expert-curated annotations ensuring temporal precision and cross-modal validity. Comprehensive evaluations show that the Gemini family consistently outperforms open-source systems, with Gemini 2.5 Pro achieving the best results. Among open models, Qwen3-Omni-30B approaches Gemini 2.0 Flash but remains far behind Gemini 2.5 Pro, primarily due to weaker audiovisual fusion rather than visual perception.

The proposed approach is validated on an inverted pendulum system, demonstrating the ability to learn neural network controllers and contraction metrics that provably satisfy the contraction condition.",

We use hardware-aware neural architecture search (HW-NAS) to derive lightweight TC models that are accurate, efficient, and deployable on edge platforms. Two input formats are considered: a flattened byte sequence and a 2D packet-wise time series; we examine how input structure affects adversarial vulnerability when using resource-constrained models. Robustness is assessed against white-box attacks, specifically Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD). On USTC-TFC2016, both HW-NAS models achieve over 99% clean-data accuracy while remaining within 65k parameters and 2M FLOPs. Yet under perturbations of strength 0.1, their robustness diverges: the flat model retains over 85% accuracy, while the time-series variant drops below 35%. Adversarial fine-tuning delivers robust gains, with flat-input accuracy exceeding 96% and the time-series variant recovering over 60 percentage points in robustness, all without compromising efficiency. The results underscore how input structure influences adversarial vulnerability, and show that even compact, resource-efficient models can attain strong robustness, supporting their practical deployment in secure edge-based TC.",

In this work, we propose a novel SPS variant, Safeguarded SPS (SPS$_{safe}$), for the stochastic subgradient method, and provide rigorous convergence guarantees for non-smooth convex optimization with no need for strong assumptions. We further incorporate momentum into the update rule, yielding equally tight theoretical results. Comprehensive experiments on convex benchmarks and deep neural networks corroborate our theory: the proposed step size accelerates convergence, reduces variance, and consistently outperforms existing adaptive baselines.

Multi-agent debate (MAD) has emerged as a popular way to leverage these strengths for robust reasoning, though it has mostly been applied to language-only tasks, leaving its efficacy on multimodal problems underexplored. In this paper, we study MAD for solving vision-and-language reasoning problems. Our setup enables generalizing the debate protocol with heterogeneous experts that possess single- and multi-modal capabilities. To this end, we present Weighted Iterative Society-of-Experts (WISE), a generalized and modular MAD framework that partitions the agents into Solvers, that generate solutions, and Reflectors, that verify correctness, assign weights, and provide natural language feedback. To aggregate the agents' solutions across debate rounds, while accounting for variance in their responses and the feedback weights, we present a modified Dawid-Skene algorithm for post-processing that integrates our two-stage debate model. We evaluate WISE on SMART-840, VisualPuzzles, EvoChart-QA, and a new SMART-840++ dataset with programmatically generated problem instances of controlled difficulty. Our results show that WISE consistently improves accuracy by 2-7% over the state-of-the-art MAD setups and aggregation methods across diverse multimodal tasks and LLM configurations.",

We introduce a large language model (LLM)-based automated framework that bridges these two dimensions by aligning on-chain issuance data with off-chain disclosure statements. First, we propose an integrative framework using LLMs to capture and analyze on- and off-chain data through document parsing and semantic alignment, extracting key financial indicators from issuer attestations and mapping them to corresponding on-chain metrics. Second, we integrate multi-chain issuance records and disclosure documents within a model context protocol (MCP) framework that standardizes LLMs access to both quantitative market data and qualitative disclosure narratives. This framework enables unified retrieval and contextual alignment across heterogeneous stablecoin information sources and facilitates consistent analysis. Third, we demonstrate the capability of LLMs to operate across heterogeneous data modalities in blockchain analytics, quantifying discrepancies between reported and observed circulation and examining their implications for cross-chain transparency and price dynamics. Our findings reveal systematic gaps between disclosed and verifiable data, showing that LLM-assisted analysis enhances cross-modal transparency and supports automated, data-driven auditing in decentralized finance (DeFi).",

        "abstract": "Recent advances in video large language models have demonstrated strong capabilities in understanding short clips. However, scaling them to hours- or days-long videos remains highly challenging due to limited context capacity and the loss of critical visual details during abstraction. Existing memory-augmented methods mitigate this by leveraging textual summaries of video segments, yet they heavily rely on text and fail to utilize visual evidence when reasoning over complex scenes. Moreover, retrieving from fixed temporal scales further limits their flexibility in capturing events that span variable durations. To address this, we introduce WorldMM, a novel multimodal memory agent that constructs and retrieves from multiple complementary memories, encompassing both textual and visual representations. WorldMM comprises three types of memory: episodic memory indexes factual events across multiple temporal scales, semantic memory continuously updates high-level conceptual knowledge, and visual memory preserves detailed information about scenes. During inference, an adaptive retrieval agent iteratively selects the most relevant memory source and leverages multiple temporal granularities based on the query, continuing until it determines that sufficient information has been gathered. WorldMM significantly outperforms existing baselines across five long video question-answering benchmarks, achieving an average 8.4% performance gain over previous state-of-the-art methods, showing its effectiveness on long video reasoning.",

Traditional join discovery methods are largely designed for equi-joins, which assume that join keys match exactly or nearly so. These techniques, while efficient in clean, well-normalized databases, fail in open or federated settings where identifiers are inconsistently formatted, embedded, or split across multiple columns. Approximate or fuzzy joins alleviate minor string variations but cannot capture systematic transformations. We introduce QJoin, a reinforcement-learning framework that learns and reuses transformation strategies across join tasks. QJoin trains an agent under a uniqueness-aware reward that balances similarity with key distinctiveness, enabling it to explore concise, high-value transformation chains. To accelerate new joins, we introduce two reuse mechanisms: (i) agent transfer, which initializes new policies from pretrained agents, and (ii) transformation reuse, which caches successful operator sequences for similar column clusters. On the AutoJoin Web benchmark (31 table pairs), QJoin achieves an average F1-score of 91.0%. For 19,990 join tasks in NYC+Chicago open datasets, Qjoin reduces runtime by up to 7.4% (13,747 s) by using reusing. These results demonstrate that transformation learning and reuse can make join discovery both more accurate and more efficient.",

In this paper, we propose WorldPack, a video world model with efficient compressed memory, which significantly improves spatial consistency, fidelity, and quality in long-term generation despite much shorter context length. Our compressed memory consists of trajectory packing and memory retrieval; trajectory packing realizes high context efficiency, and memory retrieval maintains the consistency in rollouts and helps long-term generations that require spatial reasoning. Our performance is evaluated with LoopNav, a benchmark on Minecraft, specialized for the evaluation of long-term consistency, and we verify that WorldPack notably outperforms strong state-of-the-art models.",

Yet such conclusions can be surprisingly fragile: even minor data errors - duplicate records, or entry mistakes - may drastically alter causal relationships. This raises a fundamental question: how robust is a causal claim to small, targeted modifications in the data? Addressing this question is essential for ensuring the reliability, interpretability, and reproducibility of empirical findings. We introduce SubCure, a framework for robustness auditing via cardinality repairs. Given a causal query and a user-specified target range for the estimated effect, SubCure identifies a small set of tuples or subpopulations whose removal shifts the estimate into the desired range. This process not only quantifies the sensitivity of causal conclusions but also pinpoints the specific regions of the data that drive those conclusions. We formalize this problem under both tuple- and pattern-level deletion settings and show both are NP-complete. To scale to large datasets, we develop efficient algorithms that incorporate machine unlearning techniques to incrementally update causal estimates without retraining from scratch. We evaluate SubCure across four real-world datasets covering diverse application domains. In each case, it uncovers compact, high-impact subsets whose removal significantly shifts the causal conclusions, revealing vulnerabilities that traditional methods fail to detect. Our results demonstrate that cardinality repair is a powerful and general-purpose tool for stress-testing causal analyses and guarding against misleading claims rooted in ordinary data imperfections.",

Classical approaches, such as variational regularization and Bayesian inference, provide well established theoretical foundations for handling ill posedness. However, these methods often become computationally restrictive in high dimensional settings or when the forward model is governed by complex physics. Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have recently emerged as a promising framework for solving inverse problems by embedding physical laws directly into the training process of neural networks. In this paper, we introduce a new perspective on the Bayesian Physics Informed Neural Network (BPINN) framework, extending classical PINNs by explicitly incorporating training data generation, modeling and measurement uncertainties through Bayesian prior modeling and doing inference with the posterior laws. Also, as we focus on the inverse problems, we call this method BPINN-IP, and we show that the standard PINN formulation naturally appears as its special case corresponding to the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimate. This unified formulation allows simultaneous exploitation of physical constraints, prior knowledge, and data-driven inference, while enabling uncertainty quantification through posterior distributions. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we consider inverse problems arising in infrared image processing, including deconvolution and super-resolution, and present results on both simulated and real industrial data.",

To address these issues, we propose a generative feedback (i.e., reward model) framework that provides multi-dimensional language and audio feedback for SVS assessment. Our approach leverages an audio-language model to generate text and audio critiques-covering aspects such as melody, content, and auditory quality. The model is fine-tuned on a hybrid dataset combining human music reactions and synthetic critiques from a MLLMs, enhancing diversity and linguistic richness. Quantitative experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed dataset and training strategy, demonstrating that the framework produces musically accurate and interpretable evaluations suitable for guiding generative model improvement.

In particular, for tensor train (TT) models, it is unclear which TT-core should be treated in a Bayesian manner. We introduce a Bayesian tensor train kernel machine that applies Laplace approximation to estimate the posterior distribution over a selected TT-core and employs variational inference (VI) for precision hyperparameters. Experiments show that core selection is largely independent of TT-ranks and feature structure, and that VI replaces cross-validation while offering up to 65x faster training. The method's effectiveness is demonstrated on an inverse dynamics problem.",

Recent work has shown that interpreting LTL instructions as finite automata, which can be seen as high-level programs monitoring task progress, enables learning a single generalist policy capable of executing arbitrary instructions at test time. However, existing approaches fall short in environments where multiple high-level events (i.e., atomic propositions) can be true at the same time and potentially interact in complicated ways. In this work, we propose a novel approach to learning a multi-task policy for following arbitrary LTL instructions that addresses this shortcoming. Our method conditions the policy on sequences of simple Boolean formulae, which directly align with transitions in the automaton, and are encoded via a graph neural network (GNN) to yield structured task representations.

We present several arguments to motivate the FRTD embedding. First, we show that FRTDs are strictly more informative than eigenvalue spectra, yet insufficient for complete graph identification, thus placing FRTD equivalence between cospectrality and isomorphism. Second, we argue that FRTD equivalence between nodes captures structural similarity. Third, we empirically demonstrate that the FRTD embedding outperforms manually designed graph metrics in network alignment tasks. Finally, we show that random networks that approximately match the FRTD of a desired target also preserve other salient features.

Many pruning methods rely solely on token importance and thus overlook inter-token redundancy, retaining numerous duplicated tokens and wasting capacity. Although some redundancy-aware approaches have been proposed, they often ignore the spatial relationships among visual tokens. This can lead to overly sparse selections of retained tokens that fail to adequately cover the regions of target objects. To address these limitations, we propose VLM-Pruner, a training-free token pruning algorithm that explicitly balances redundancy and spatial sparsity. We introduce a centrifugal token pruning paradigm that enables near-to-far selection while prioritizing the preservation of fine-grained object details. Moreover, we design a Buffering for Spatial Sparsity (BSS) criterion that defers the selection of spatially distant tokens. We further adopt a parallel greedy strategy to conduct token selection efficiently. To mitigate information loss from pruning, we selectively fuse salient information from the discarded tokens into the retained ones. Comprehensive comparisons demonstrate that VLM-Pruner consistently outperforms strong baselines across five VLMs with an 88.9\\% pruning rate, while delivering an end-to-end inference speedup.",

To address this, we introduce CREST (CRoss-lingual Efficient Safety Transfer), a parameter-efficient multilingual safety classification model that supports 100 languages with only 0.5B parameters. By training on a strategically chosen subset of only 13 high-resource languages, our model utilizes cluster-based cross-lingual transfer from a few to 100 languages, enabling effective generalization to both unseen high-resource and low-resource languages. This approach addresses the challenge of limited training data in low-resource settings. We conduct comprehensive evaluations across six safety benchmarks to demonstrate that CREST outperforms existing state-of-the-art guardrails of comparable scale and achieves competitive results against models with significantly larger parameter counts (2.5B parameters and above). Our findings highlight the limitations of language-specific guardrails and underscore the importance of developing universal, language-agnostic safety systems that can scale effectively to serve global populations.",

General-purpose memory architectures struggle to identify the key drivers of price movements. To address this, we propose StockMem, an event-reflection dual-layer memory framework. It structures news into events and mines them along two dimensions: horizontal consolidation integrates daily events, while longitudinal tracking captures event evolution to extract incremental information reflecting market expectation discrepancies. This builds a temporal event knowledge base. By analyzing event-price dynamics, the framework further forms a reflection knowledge base of causal experiences. For prediction, it retrieves analogous historical scenarios and reasons with current events, incremental data, and past experiences. Experiments show StockMem outperforms existing memory architectures and provides superior, explainable reasoning by tracing the information chain affecting prices, enhancing decision transparency in financial forecasting.",

In this paper, I overcome this obstacle by proposing a practical solution that trains quantum Boltzmann machines for Born-rule generative modeling. Two key ingredients in the proposal are the Donsker-Varadhan variational representation of the classical relative entropy and the quantum Boltzmann gradient estimator of [Patel et al., arXiv:2410.12935]. I present the main result for a more general ansatz known as an evolved quantum Boltzmann machine [Minervini et al., arXiv:2501.03367], which combines parameterized real- and imaginary-time evolution.

We prove that this operator generates a vector field on the parameter manifold $\\Theta$, and we identify the coefficient of self-improvement $\\kappa$ as the Lie derivative of the capability functional along this flow. The central contribution of this work is the derivation of the Variance Inequality, a spectral condition that is sufficient (under mild regularity) for the stability of self-improvement. We show that a sufficient condition for $\\kappa > 0$ is that, up to curvature and step-size effects, the combined noise of generation and verification must be small enough. We then apply this formalism to unify the recent literature on Language Self-Play (LSP), Self-Correction, and Synthetic Data bootstrapping. We demonstrate that architectures such as STaR, SPIN, Reflexion, GANs and AlphaZero are specific topological realizations of the GVU operator that satisfy the Variance Inequality through filtration, adversarial discrimination, or grounding in formal systems.",

This is enabled by two key contributions: 1) Query-Broadcast Attention, a mechanism that ensures structural consistency by sharing queries across all maps in each self-attention block. 2) Tensor LoRA, a tensor-based adaptation that parameter-efficiently models cross-map relations for efficient joint training. Together, these designs enable stable joint diffusion training and unified generation of multiple intrinsic properties. Experiments show that LumiX produces coherent and physically meaningful results, achieving 23% higher alignment and a better preference score (0.19 vs. -0.41) compared to the state of the art, and it can also perform image-conditioned intrinsic decomposition within the same framework.",

Existing theoretical methods assume that downstream task classes are drawn from the same latent class distribution used during the pretraining phase. However, in real-world settings, downstream tasks may not only exhibit distributional shifts within the same label space but also introduce new or broader label spaces, leading to domain generalization challenges. In this work, we introduce novel generalization bounds that explicitly account for both types of mismatch: domain shift and domain generalization. Specifically, we analyze scenarios where downstream tasks either (i) draw classes from the same latent class space but with shifted distributions, or (ii) involve new label spaces beyond those seen during pretraining. Our analysis reveals how the performance of contrastively learned representations depends on the statistical discrepancy between pretraining and downstream distributions. This extended perspective allows us to derive provable guarantees on the performance of learned representations on average classification tasks involving class distributions outside the pretraining latent class set.",

While prior work has focused on English-only settings, real-world deployments benefit from having a single prompt to operate reliably across languages. This paper presents a comprehensive study of how different system prompts steer models toward accurate and robust cross-lingual behavior. We propose a unified four-dimensional evaluation framework to assess system prompts in multilingual environments. Through large-scale experiments on five languages, three LLMs, and three benchmarks, we uncover that certain prompt components, such as CoT, emotion, and scenario, correlate with robust multilingual behavior. We develop a prompt optimization framework for multilingual settings and show it can automatically discover prompts that improve all metrics by 5-10%. Finally, we analyze over 10 million reasoning units and find that more performant system prompts induce more structured and consistent reasoning patterns, while reducing unnecessary language-switching. Together, we highlight system prompt optimization as a scalable path to accurate and robust multilingual LLM behavior.",

        "abstract": "The safe deployment of autonomous driving systems (ADSs) relies on comprehensive testing and evaluation. However, safety-critical scenarios that can effectively expose system vulnerabilities are extremely sparse in the real world. Existing scenario generation methods face challenges in efficiently constructing long-tail scenarios that ensure fidelity, criticality, and interactivity, while particularly lacking real-time dynamic response capabilities to the vehicle under test (VUT). To address these challenges, this paper proposes a safety-critical testing scenario generation framework that integrates the high-level semantic understanding capabilities of Vision Language Models (VLMs) with the fine-grained generation capabilities of adaptive guided diffusion models. The framework establishes a three-layer hierarchical architecture comprising a strategic layer for VLM-directed scenario generation objective determination, a tactical layer for guidance function formulation, and an operational layer for guided diffusion execution. We first establish a high-quality fundamental diffusion model that learns the data distribution of real driving scenarios. Next, we design an adaptive guided diffusion method that enables real-time, precise control of background vehicles (BVs) in closed-loop simulation. The VLM is then incorporated to autonomously generate scenario generation objectives and guidance functions through deep scenario understanding and risk reasoning, ultimately guiding the diffusion model to achieve VLM-directed scenario generation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can efficiently generate realistic, diverse, and highly interactive safety-critical testing scenarios. Furthermore, case studies validate the adaptability and VLM-directed generation performance of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "Probabilistic seismic inverse modeling often requires the prediction of both spatially correlated geological heterogeneities (e.g., facies) and continuous parameters (e.g., rock and elastic properties). Generative adversarial networks (GANs) provide an efficient training-image-based simulation framework capable of reproducing complex geological models with high accuracy and comparably low generative cost. However, their application in stochastic geophysical inversion for multivariate property prediction is limited, as representing multiple coupled properties requires large and unstable networks with high memory and training demands. A more recent variant of GANs with spatially adaptive denormalization (SPADE-GAN) enables the direct conditioning of facies spatial distributions on local probability maps. Leveraging on such features, an iterative geostatistical inversion algorithm is proposed, SPADE-GANInv, integrating a pre-trained SPADE-GAN with geostatistical simulation, for the prediction of facies and multiple correlated continuous properties from seismic data. The SPADE-GAN is trained to reproduce realistic facies geometries, while sequential stochastic co-simulation predicts the spatial variability of the facies-dependent continuous properties. At each iteration, a set of subsurface realizations is generated and used to compute synthetic seismic data. The realizations providing the highest similarity coefficient to the observed data are used to update the subsurface probability models in the next iteration. The method is demonstrated on both 2-D synthetic scenarios and field data, targeting the prediction of facies, porosity, and acoustic impedance from full-stack seismic data. Results show that the algorithm enables accurate multivariate prediction, mitigates the impact of biased prior data, and accommodates additional local conditioning such as well logs.",

        "abstract": "Recent advances in reasoning techniques have substantially improved the performance of large language models (LLMs), raising expectations for their ability to provide accurate, truthful, and reliable information. However, emerging evidence suggests that iterative reasoning may foster belief entrenchment and confirmation bias, rather than enhancing truth-seeking behavior. In this study, we propose a systematic evaluation framework for belief entrenchment in LLM reasoning by leveraging the Martingale property from Bayesian statistics. This property implies that, under rational belief updating, the expected value of future beliefs should remain equal to the current belief, i.e., belief updates are unpredictable from the current belief. We propose the unsupervised, regression-based Martingale Score to measure violations of this property, which signal deviation from the Bayesian ability of updating on new evidence. In open-ended problem domains including event forecasting, value-laden questions, and academic paper review, we find such violations to be widespread across models and setups, where the current belief positively predicts future belief updates, a phenomenon which we term belief entrenchment. We identify the models, reasoning techniques, and domains more prone to belief entrenchment. Finally, we validate the Martingale Score by showing that it predicts ground-truth accuracy on problem domains where ground truth labels are available. This indicates that, while designed as an unsupervised metric that operates even in domains without access to ground truth, the Martingale Score is a useful proxy of the truth-seeking ability of a reasoning process.",

        "abstract": "While machine learning has enabled the rapid prediction of inorganic materials with novel properties, the challenge of determining how to synthesize these materials remains largely unsolved. Previous work has largely focused on predicting precursors or reaction conditions, but only rarely on full synthesis pathways. We introduce the ActionGraph, a directed acyclic graph framework that encodes both the chemical and procedural structure, in terms of synthesis operations, of inorganic synthesis reactions. Using 13,017 text-mined solid-state synthesis reactions from the Materials Project, we show that incorporating PCA-reduced ActionGraph adjacency matrices into a $k$-nearest neighbors retrieval model significantly improves synthesis pathway prediction. While the ActionGraph framework only results in a 1.34% and 2.76% increase in precursor and operation F1 scores (average over varying numbers of PCA components) respectively, the operation length matching accuracy rises 3.4 times (from 15.8% to 53.3%). We observe an interesting trade-off where precursor prediction performance peaks at 10-11 PCA components while operation prediction continues improving up to 30 components. This suggests composition information dominates precursor selection while structural information is critical for operation sequencing. Overall, the ActionGraph framework demonstrates strong potential, and with further adoption, its full range of benefits can be effectively realized.",

        "abstract": "Gravitational-wave data analysis relies on accurate and efficient methods to extract physical information from noisy detector signals, yet the increasing rate and complexity of observations represent a growing challenge. Deep learning provides a powerful alternative to traditional inference, but existing neural models typically lack the flexibility to handle variations in data analysis settings. Such variations accommodate imperfect observations or are required for specialized tests, and could include changes in detector configurations, overall frequency ranges, or localized cuts. We introduce a flexible transformer-based architecture paired with a training strategy that enables adaptation to diverse analysis settings at inference time. Applied to parameter estimation, we demonstrate that a single flexible model -- called Dingo-T1 -- can (i) analyze 48 gravitational-wave events from the third LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Observing Run under a wide range of analysis configurations, (ii) enable systematic studies of how detector and frequency configurations impact inferred posteriors, and (iii) perform inspiral-merger-ringdown consistency tests probing general relativity. Dingo-T1 also improves median sample efficiency on real events from a baseline of 1.4% to 4.2%. Our approach thus demonstrates flexible and scalable inference with a principled framework for handling missing or incomplete data -- key capabilities for current and next-generation observatories.",

Deployed and iterated over three years, LORE achieves a cumulative +27\\% improvement in online GoodRate metrics. This report shares the valuable experience gained throughout its development lifecycle, spanning data, features, training, evaluation, and deployment. Insight. While existing works apply Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to enhance relevance, they often hit a performance ceiling. We argue this stems from treating relevance as a monolithic task, lacking principled deconstruction. Our key insight is that relevance comprises distinct capabilities: knowledge and reasoning, multi-modal matching, and rule adherence. We contend that a qualitative-driven decomposition is essential for breaking through current performance bottlenecks. Contributions. LORE provides a complete blueprint for the LLM relevance lifecycle. Key contributions include: (1) A two-stage training paradigm combining progressive CoT synthesis via SFT with human preference alignment via RL. (2) A comprehensive benchmark, RAIR, designed to evaluate these core capabilities. (3) A query frequency-stratified deployment strategy that efficiently transfers offline LLM capabilities to the online system. LORE serves as both a practical solution and a methodological reference for other vertical domains.",

It focuses in particular on the derivation and identification of physically consistent models, which are essential for model-based control synthesis. Lagrangian or Hamiltonian neural networks provide useful structural guarantees but the learning of such models often leads to inconsistent models, especially on real physical systems where training data are limited, partial and noisy. Motivated by this observation and the objective to exploit these models for model-based nonlinear control, a learning algorithm relying on an original loss function is proposed to improve the physical consistency of Lagrangian systems. A comparative analysis of different learning-based modeling approaches with the proposed solution shows significant improvements in terms of physical consistency of the learned models, on both simulated and experimental systems. The model's consistency is then exploited to demonstrate, on an experimental benchmark, the practical relevance of the proposed methodology for feedback linearization and energy-based control techniques.",
