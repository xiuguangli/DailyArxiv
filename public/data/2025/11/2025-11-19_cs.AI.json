        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs), such as DeepSeek R1,OpenAI o3, and Gemini 2.5 Pro, have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities across logical inference, problem solving, and decision making. However, spatial reasoning:a fundamental component of human cognition that includes mental rotation, navigation, and spatial relationship comprehension remains a significant challenge for current advanced VLMs. We hypothesize that imagination, the internal simulation of spatial states, is the dominant reasoning mechanism within a spatial world model. To test this hypothesis and systematically probe current VLM spatial reasoning mechanisms, we introduce SpatiaLite, a fully synthetic benchmark that jointly measures spatial reasoning accuracy and reasoning efficiency. Comprehensive experiments reveal three key findings. First, advanced VLMs predominantly rely on linguistic representations for reasoning and imagination, resulting in significant deficiencies on visual centric tasks that demand perceptual spatial relations and 3D geometry transformations such as mental rotation or projection prediction. Second, advanced VLMs exhibit severe inefficiency in their current spatial reasoning mechanisms, with token usage growing rapidly as transformation complexity increases. Third, we propose an Imagery Driven Framework (IDF) for data synthesis and training, which can implicitly construct an internal world model that is critical for spatial reasoning in VLMs. Building on SpatiaLite, this work delineates the spatial reasoning limits and patterns of advanced VLMs, identifies key shortcomings, and informs future advances",

We evaluate KOSMOS, an autonomous AI scientist, on three problems in radiation biology using simple random-gene null benchmarks. Hypothesis 1: baseline DNA damage response (DDR) capacity across cell lines predicts the p53 transcriptional response after irradiation (GSE30240). Hypothesis 2: baseline expression of OGT and CDO1 predicts the strength of repressed and induced radiation-response modules in breast cancer cells (GSE59732). Hypothesis 3: a 12-gene expression signature predicts biochemical recurrence-free survival after prostate radiotherapy plus androgen deprivation therapy (GSE116918). The DDR-p53 hypothesis was not supported: DDR score and p53 response were weakly negatively correlated (Spearman rho = -0.40, p = 0.76), indistinguishable from random five-gene scores. OGT showed only a weak association (r = 0.23, p = 0.34), whereas CDO1 was a clear outlier (r = 0.70, empirical p = 0.0039). The 12-gene signature achieved a concordance index of 0.61 (p = 0.017) but a non-unique effect size. Overall, KOSMOS produced one well-supported discovery, one plausible but uncertain result, and one false hypothesis, illustrating that AI scientists can generate useful ideas but require rigorous auditing against appropriate null models.",

They assumed that the SCMs were learned from purely observational data, leading to an imprecise characterization of the marginal distributions of exogenous variables. Their method leveraged the canonical representation of structural equations to decompose a general SCM with high-cardinality exogenous variables into a set of sub-models with low-cardinality exogenous variables. These sub-models had precise marginals over the exogenous variables and therefore admitted efficient exact inference. The aggregated results were used to bound counterfactual probabilities in the original model. The approach was developed for Markovian models, where each exogenous variable affects only a single endogenous variable. In this paper, we investigate extending the methodology to \\textit{semi-Markovian} SCMs, where exogenous variables may influence multiple endogenous variables. Such models are capable of representing confounding relationships that Markovian models cannot. We illustrate the challenges of this extension using a minimal example, which motivates a set of alternative solution strategies. These strategies are evaluated both theoretically and through a computational study.",

Third, we propose a multi-layered response filtering defense technique to prevent the model from generating inappropriate responses. We perform extensive experiments with the proposed attack and defense on the state-of-the-art LVLMs (both open-source and closed-source).

        "abstract": "Rule-based systems must solve complex matching problems within tight time constraints to be effective in real-time applications, such as planning and reactive control for AI agents, as well as low-latency relational database querying. Pattern-matching systems can encounter issues where exponential time and space are required to find matches for rules with many underconstrained variables, or which produce combinatorial intermediate partial matches (but are otherwise well-constrained). When online AI systems automatically generate rules from example-driven induction or code synthesis, they can easily produce worst-case matching patterns that slow or halt program execution by exceeding available memory. In our own work with cognitive systems that learn from example, we've found that aggressive forms of anti-unification-based generalization can easily produce these circumstances. To make these systems practical without hand-engineering constraints or succumbing to unpredictable failure modes, we introduce a new matching algorithm called CORGI (Collection-Oriented Relational Graph Iteration). Unlike RETE-based approaches, CORGI offers quadratic time and space guarantees for finding single satisficing matches, and the ability to iteratively stream subsequent matches without committing entire conflict sets to memory. CORGI differs from RETE in that it does not have a traditional $\\beta$-memory for collecting partial matches. Instead, CORGI takes a two-step approach: a graph of grounded relations is built/maintained in a forward pass, and an iterator generates matches as needed by working backward through the graph. This approach eliminates the high-latency delays and memory overflows that can result from populating full conflict sets. In a performance evaluation, we demonstrate that CORGI significantly outperforms RETE implementations from SOAR and OPS5 on a simple combinatorial matching task.",

Experimental results demonstrate that AI agents effectively enhance musical pattern recognition, compositional parameterization, and educational feedback, outperforming traditional automated methods in terms of interpretability and adaptability. The findings highlight key challenges concerning transparency, cultural bias, and the definition of hybrid evaluation metrics, emphasizing the need for responsible deployment of AI in educational environments.

However, existing methods struggle with challenges of scalability and retrieval efficiency, particularly when handling complex, multi-hop questions that require multi-step reasoning. To address these challenges, this paper introduces ALEX (A Light Editing-knowledge Extractor), a lightweight knowledge editing framework. The core innovation of ALEX is its hierarchical memory architecture, which organizes knowledge updates (edits) into semantic clusters. This design fundamentally reduces retrieval complexity from a linear O(N) to a highly scalable O(K+N/C). Furthermore, the framework integrates an Inferential Query Synthesis (IQS) module to bridge the semantic gap between queries and facts , and a Dynamic Evidence Adjudication (DEA) engine that executes an efficient two-stage retrieval process. Experiments on the MQUAKE benchmark demonstrate that ALEX significantly improves both the accuracy of multi-hop answers (MultiHop-ACC) and the reliability of reasoning paths (HopWise-ACC). It also reduces the required search space by over 80% , presenting a promising path toward building scalable, efficient, and accurate knowledge editing systems.",

However, MCIs occur infrequently, and sufficient records are difficult to accumulate at the scene, making it challenging to collect large-scale realworld data for research use. Therefore, we developed Syn-STARTS, a framework that uses LLMs to generate triage cases, and verified its effectiveness. The results showed that the triage cases generated by Syn-STARTS were qualitatively indistinguishable from the TRIAGE open dataset generated by manual curation from training materials. Furthermore, when evaluating the LLM accuracy using hundreds of cases each from the green, yellow, red, and black categories defined by the standard triage method START, the results were found to be highly stable. This strongly indicates the possibility of synthetic data in developing high-performance AI models for severe and critical medical situations.",

This study presents evidence supporting an instructor-governed feedback loop that converts concept-level assessment evidence into vetted micro-interventions. The adaptive learning algorithm contains three safeguards: adequacy as a hard guarantee of gap closure, attention as a budgeted constraint for time and redundancy, and diversity as protection against overfitting to a single resource. We formalize intervention assignment as a binary integer program with constraints for coverage, time, difficulty windows informed by ability estimates, prerequisites encoded by a concept matrix, and anti-redundancy enforced through diversity. Greedy selection serves low-richness and tight-latency regimes, gradient-based relaxation serves rich repositories, and a hybrid method transitions along a richness-latency frontier. In simulation and in an introductory physics deployment with one thousand two hundred four students, both solvers achieved full skill coverage for essentially all learners within bounded watch time. The gradient-based method reduced redundant coverage by approximately twelve percentage points relative to greedy and harmonized difficulty across slates, while greedy delivered comparable adequacy with lower computational cost in scarce settings. Slack variables localized missing content and supported targeted curation, sustaining sufficiency across subgroups. The result is a tractable and auditable controller that closes the diagnostic-pedagogical loop and delivers equitable, load-aware personalization at classroom scale.",

This problem is interesting because LLMs often hallucinate when direct evidence to answer a question is lacking, and these effects become more pronounced in a network of interacting LLMs. The hallucination spreads, causing previously accurate LLMs to hallucinate. We study interacting LLMs and their hallucination by combining novel ideas of mean-field dynamics (MFD) from network science and the randomized utility model from economics to construct a useful generative model. We model the LLM with a latent state that indicates if it is truthful or not with respect to the ground truth, and extend a tractable analytical model considering an MFD to model the diffusion of information in a directed network of LLMs. To specify the probabilities that govern the dynamics of the MFD, we propose a randomized utility model. For a network of LLMs, where each LLM has two possible latent states, we posit sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of a fixed point and analyze the behavior of the fixed point in terms of the incentive (e.g., test-time compute) given to individual LLMs. We experimentally study and analyze the behavior of a network of $100$ open-source LLMs with respect to data heterogeneity, node capability, network structure, and sensitivity to framing on multiple semi-synthetic datasets.",

However, crafting satisfactory designs is time-intensive for designers: they need to consider which controls and content to present on the page, and then repeatedly adjust their size, position, and style for better aesthetics and structure. Although many design software can now help to perform these repetitive tasks, extensive training is needed to use them effectively. Moreover, collaborative design across app pages demands extra time to align standards and ensure consistent styling. In this work, we propose APD-agents, a large language model (LLM) driven multi-agent framework for automated page design in mobile applications. Our framework contains OrchestratorAgent, SemanticParserAgent, PrimaryLayoutAgent, TemplateRetrievalAgent, and RecursiveComponentAgent. Upon receiving the user's description of the page, the OrchestratorAgent can dynamically can direct other agents to accomplish users' design task. To be specific, the SemanticParserAgent is responsible for converting users' descriptions of page content into structured data. The PrimaryLayoutAgent can generate an initial coarse-grained layout of this page. The TemplateRetrievalAgent can fetch semantically relevant few-shot examples and enhance the quality of layout generation. Besides, a RecursiveComponentAgent can be used to decide how to recursively generate all the fine-grained sub-elements it contains for each element in the layout. Our work fully leverages the automatic collaboration capabilities of large-model-driven multi-agent systems.

Extracting task-relevant information from lengthy financial filings is essential for both operational and analytical decision-making. The FinAgentBench dataset formalizes this problem through two tasks: document ranking and chunk ranking. We present PRISM, a training-free framework that integrates refined system prompting, in-context learning (ICL), and a lightweight multi-agent system. Each component is examined extensively to reveal their synergies: prompt engineering provides precise task instructions, ICL supplies semantically relevant few-shot examples, and the multi-agent system models coordinated scoring behaviour. Our best configuration achieves an NDCG@5 of 0.71818 on the restricted validation split. We further demonstrate that PRISM is feasible and robust for production-scale financial retrieval. Its modular, inference-only design makes it practical for real-world use cases. The source code is released at this https URL.",

Recent research underscores the potential of harnessing large language models (LLMs) for VLN, given their commonsense knowledge and general reasoning capabilities. Despite their strengths, a substantial gap in task completion performance persists between LLM-based approaches and domain experts, as LLMs inherently struggle to comprehend real-world spatial correlations precisely. Additionally, introducing LLMs is accompanied with substantial computational cost and inference latency. To address these issues, we propose a novel dual-process thinking framework dubbed R3, integrating LLMs' generalization capabilities with VLN-specific expertise in a zero-shot manner. The framework comprises three core modules: Runner, Ruminator, and Regulator. The Runner is a lightweight transformer-based expert model that ensures efficient and accurate navigation under regular circumstances. The Ruminator employs a powerful multimodal LLM as the backbone and adopts chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to elicit structured reasoning. The Regulator monitors the navigation progress and controls the appropriate thinking mode according to three criteria, integrating Runner and Ruminator harmoniously. Experimental results illustrate that R3 significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, exceeding 3.28% and 3.30% in SPL and RGSPL respectively on the REVERIE benchmark. This pronounced enhancement highlights the effectiveness of our method in handling challenging VLN tasks.",

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in finance and economics, where prompt-based attempts against look-ahead bias implicitly assume that models understand chronology. We test this fundamental question with a series of chronological ordering tasks with increasing complexities over facts the model already knows from pre-training. Our tasks cover (1) chronological ordering, (2) conditional sorting (filter, then order), and (3) anachronism detection. We evaluate GPT-4.1, Claude-3.7 Sonnet, with and without Extended Thinking (ET), and GPT-5 across multiple reasoning-effort settings. Across models, Exact match rate drops sharply as sequences lengthen even while rank correlations stay high as LLMs largely preserve local order but struggle to maintain a single globally consistent timeline. In conditional sorting, most failures stem from the filtering step rather than the ordering step, but GPT-5 and Claude-3.7 Sonnet with Extended Thinking outshine normal models significantly. Lastly, anachronism detection is found to be the easiest task for the LLMs but performance still declines with increasingly overlapping timelines or entities. Overall, our main contribution is showing that allocating explicit reasoning budget helps with chronological ordering with GPT-5 at medium/high reasoning effort achieving flawless ordering at all lengths and perfect conditional sorting (both self-filtered and given-subset), whereas low/minimal effort degrades with longer lists, mirroring earlier models. Our findings delineate limits of current LLMs on chronological tasks, providing insights into task complexity, and demonstrate scenarios in which reasoning helps. These patterns are important for the real-time application of LLMs in finance. We release all code and evaluation templates to support full reproducibility.",

However, it frequently suffers from hallucination errors, especially under noisy acoustic conditions. Previous works to reduce hallucinations in Whisper-style ASR systems have primarily focused on audio preprocessing or post-processing of transcriptions to filter out erroneous content. However, modifications to the Whisper model itself remain largely unexplored to mitigate hallucinations directly. To address this challenge, we present a two-stage architecture that first enhances encoder robustness through Adaptive Layer Attention (ALA) and further suppresses hallucinations using a multi-objective knowledge distillation (KD) framework. In the first stage, ALA groups encoder layers into semantically coherent blocks via inter-layer correlation analysis. A learnable multi-head attention module then fuses these block representations, enabling the model to jointly exploit low- and high-level features for more robust encoding. In the second stage, our KD framework trains the student model on noisy audio to align its semantic and attention distributions with a teacher model processing clean inputs. Our experiments on noisy speech benchmarks show notable reductions in hallucinations and word error rates, while preserving performance on clean speech. Together, ALA and KD offer a principled strategy to improve Whisper's reliability under real-world noisy conditions.",

To address these issues, we propose DevPiolt, a LLM-based recommendation model for IoT device operations. Specifically, we first equip the LLM with fundamental domain knowledge of IoT operations via continual pre-training and multi-task fine-tuning. Then, we employ direct preference optimization to align the fine-tuned LLM with specific user preferences. Finally, we design a confidence-based exposure control mechanism to avoid negative user experiences from low-quality recommendations. Extensive experiments show that DevPiolt significantly outperforms baselines on all datasets, with an average improvement of 69.5% across all metrics. DevPiolt has been practically deployed in Xiaomi Home app for one quarter, providing daily operation recommendations to 255,000 users.

Accurately forecasting regional Airbnb market trends can thus offer critical insights for policymakers and urban planners aiming to mitigate these impacts. This study proposes a novel time-series forecasting framework to predict three key Airbnb indicators -- Revenue, Reservation Days, and Number of Reservations -- at the regional level. Using a sliding-window approach, the model forecasts trends 1 to 3 months ahead. Unlike prior studies that focus on individual listings at fixed time points, our approach constructs regional representations by integrating listing features with external contextual factors such as urban accessibility and human mobility. We convert structured tabular data into prompt-based inputs for a Large Language Model (LLM), producing comprehensive regional embeddings. These embeddings are then fed into advanced time-series models (RNN, LSTM, Transformer) to better capture complex spatio-temporal dynamics. Experiments on Seoul's Airbnb dataset show that our method reduces both average RMSE and MAE by approximately 48% compared to conventional baselines, including traditional statistical and machine learning models. Our framework not only improves forecasting accuracy but also offers practical insights for detecting oversupplied regions and supporting data-driven urban policy decisions.",

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in complex reasoning tasks. Despite promising success, current LLM-based KGR methods still face two critical limitations. First, existing methods often extract reasoning paths indiscriminately, without assessing their different importance, which may introduce irrelevant noise that misleads LLMs. Second, while many methods leverage LLMs to dynamically explore potential reasoning paths, they require high retrieval demands and frequent LLM calls. To address these limitations, we propose PathMind, a novel framework designed to enhance faithful and interpretable reasoning by selectively guiding LLMs with important reasoning paths. Specifically, PathMind follows a \"Retrieve-Prioritize-Reason\" paradigm. First, it retrieves a query subgraph from KG through the retrieval module. Next, it introduces a path prioritization mechanism that identifies important reasoning paths using a semantic-aware path priority function, which simultaneously considers the accumulative cost and the estimated future cost for reaching the target. Finally, PathMind generates accurate and logically consistent responses via a dual-phase training strategy, including task-specific instruction tuning and path-wise preference alignment. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that PathMind consistently outperforms competitive baselines, particularly on complex reasoning tasks with fewer input tokens, by identifying essential reasoning paths.",

However, much of this apparent success may derive from data contamination rather than genuine reasoning: many standard CP problems are likely included in the training data of these models. To examine this hypothesis, we systematically rephrased and perturbed a set of well-known CSPLib problems to preserve their structure while modifying their context and introducing misleading elements. We then compared the models produced by three representative LLMs across original and modified descriptions. Our qualitative analysis shows that while LLMs can produce syntactically valid and semantically plausible models, their performance drops sharply under contextual and linguistic variation, revealing shallow understanding and sensitivity to wording.",

The results revealed systematic demographic effects: male participants rated responses 18% less toxic than female participants; conservative and Black participants rated responses 27.9% and 44% more emotionally aware than liberal and White participants, respectively. Models fine-tuned on group-specific preferences exhibited distinct behaviors. Technical design choices showed strong effects: the preservation of rater disagreement achieved roughly 53% greater toxicity reduction than majority voting, and 5-point scales yielded about 22% more reduction than binary formats; and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) consistently outperformed Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) in multi-value optimization. These findings represent a preliminary step in answering a critical question: How should alignment balance expert-driven and user-driven signals to ensure both safety and fair representation?",

We present a neuro-symbolic framework that explicitly models and propagates uncertainty from perception to planning, providing a principled connection between these two abstraction levels. Our approach couples a transformer-based perceptual front-end with graph neural network (GNN) relational reasoning to extract probabilistic symbolic states from visual observations, and an uncertainty-aware symbolic planner that actively gathers information when confidence is low. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness on tabletop robotic manipulation as a concrete application: the translator processes 10,047 PyBullet-generated scenes (3--10 objects) and outputs probabilistic predicates with calibrated confidences (overall F1=0.68). When embedded in the planner, the system achieves 94\\%/90\\%/88\\% success on Simple Stack, Deep Stack, and Clear+Stack benchmarks (90.7\\% average), exceeding the strongest POMDP baseline by 10--14 points while planning within 15\\,ms. A probabilistic graphical-model analysis establishes a quantitative link between calibrated uncertainty and planning convergence, providing theoretical guarantees that are validated empirically. The framework is general-purpose and can be applied to any domain requiring uncertainty-aware reasoning from perceptual input to symbolic planning.",

In the framework, lecture content is modeled as a metric-measure space, capturing semantic and relational structure, while candidate KGs are aligned using Fused Gromov-Wasserstein (FGW) couplings to quantify semantic distortion. The rate term, expressed via the size of KG, reflects complexity and compactness. Refinement operators (add, merge, split, remove, rewire) minimize the rate-distortion Lagrangian, yielding compact, information-preserving KGs. Our prototype applied to data science lectures yields interpretable RD curves and shows that MCQs generated from refined KGs consistently surpass those from raw notes on fifteen quality criteria.

In this work, we propose AutoTool, a novel graph-based framework that bypasses repeated LLM inference by exploiting a key empirical observation: tool usage inertia - the tendency of tool invocations to follow predictable sequential patterns. AutoTool constructs a directed graph from historical agent trajectories, where nodes represent tools and edges capture transition probabilities, effectively modeling the inertia in tool selection. It further integrates parameter-level information to refine tool input generation. By traversing this structured representation, AutoTool efficiently selects tools and their parameters with minimal reliance on LLM inference. Extensive experiments across diverse agent tasks demonstrate that AutoTool reduces inference costs by up to 30% while maintaining competitive task completion rates, offering a practical and scalable enhancement for inference-heavy frameworks. Our work highlights the promise of integrating statistical structure into LLM agent design for greater efficiency without sacrificing performance.",

Effective prompts should meet three principles: focus on decision-critical information, provide step-level granularity, and minimize reliance on expert annotations through label efficiency. However, existing ICL methods often fail to satisfy all three criteria simultaneously. Motivated by these challenges, we introduce SkillGen, a skill-based ICL framework for structured sequential reasoning. It constructs an action-centric, domain-level graph from sampled trajectories, identifies high-utility actions via temporal-difference credit assignment, and retrieves step-wise skills to generate fine-grained, context-aware prompts. We further present a theoretical analysis showing that focusing on high-utility segments supports task identifiability and informs more effective ICL prompt design. Experiments on ALFWorld, BabyAI, and ScienceWorld, using both open-source and proprietary LLMs, show that SkillGen achieves consistent gains, improving progress rate by 5.9%-16.5% on average across models.",

        "abstract": "Restoring power distribution systems (PDS) after large-scale outages requires sequential switching operations that reconfigure feeder topology and coordinate distributed energy resources (DERs) under nonlinear constraints such as power balance, voltage limits, and thermal ratings. These challenges make conventional optimization and value-based RL approaches computationally inefficient and difficult to scale. This paper applies a Heterogeneous-Agent Reinforcement Learning (HARL) framework, instantiated through Heterogeneous-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (HAPPO), to enable coordinated restoration across interconnected microgrids. Each agent controls a distinct microgrid with different loads, DER capacities, and switch counts, introducing practical structural heterogeneity. Decentralized actor policies are trained with a centralized critic to compute advantage values for stable on-policy updates. A physics-informed OpenDSS environment provides full power flow feedback and enforces operational limits via differentiable penalty signals rather than invalid action masking. The total DER generation is capped at 2400 kW, and each microgrid must satisfy local supply-demand feasibility. Experiments on the IEEE 123-bus and IEEE 8500-node systems show that HAPPO achieves faster convergence, higher restored power, and smoother multi-seed training than DQN, PPO, MAES, MAGDPG, MADQN, Mean-Field RL, and QMIX. Results demonstrate that incorporating microgrid-level heterogeneity within the HARL framework yields a scalable, stable, and constraint-aware solution for complex PDS restoration.",

        "abstract": "Scientific applications continue to rely on legacy Fortran codebases originally developed for homogeneous, CPU-based systems. As High-Performance Computing (HPC) shifts toward heterogeneous GPU-accelerated architectures, many accelerators lack native Fortran bindings, creating an urgent need to modernize legacy codes for portability. Frameworks like Kokkos provide performance portability and a single-source C++ abstraction, but manual Fortran-to-Kokkos porting demands significant expertise and time. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in source-to-source code generation, yet their use in fully autonomous workflows for translating and optimizing parallel code remains largely unexplored, especially for performance portability across diverse hardware. This paper presents an agentic AI workflow where specialized LLM \"agents\" collaborate to translate, validate, compile, run, test, debug, and optimize Fortran kernels into portable Kokkos C++ programs. Results show the pipeline modernizes a range of benchmark kernels, producing performance-portable Kokkos codes across hardware partitions. Paid OpenAI models such as GPT-5 and o4-mini-high executed the workflow for only a few U.S. dollars, generating optimized codes that surpassed Fortran baselines, whereas open-source models like Llama4-Maverick often failed to yield functional codes. This work demonstrates the feasibility of agentic AI for Fortran-to-Kokkos transformation and offers a pathway for autonomously modernizing legacy scientific applications to run portably and efficiently on diverse supercomputers. It further highlights the potential of LLM-driven agentic systems to perform structured, domain-specific reasoning tasks in scientific and systems-oriented applications.",

With watermarking, we can always accurately detect LLM-generated texts. However, recent findings suggest that these techniques often negatively affect the quality of the generated texts, and adversarial attacks can strip the watermarking signals, causing the texts to possibly evade detection. These findings have created resistance in the wide adoption of watermarking by LLM creators. Finally, to encourage adoption, we evaluate the robustness of several watermarking techniques to adversarial attacks by comparing paraphrasing and back translation (i.e., English $\\to$ another language $\\to$ English) attacks; and their ability to preserve quality and writing style of the unwatermarked texts by using linguistic metrics to capture quality and writing style of texts. Our results suggest that these watermarking techniques preserve semantics, deviate from the writing style of the unwatermarked texts, and are susceptible to adversarial attacks, especially for the back translation attack.",

Second, Seneca opportunistically serves cached data over uncached ones during random batch sampling so that concurrent jobs benefit from each other.

However, they also amplify the risks of malicious misuse cases such as unauthorized collection of personally identifiable information (PII), generation of socially divisive content, and even automated web hacking. To address these threats, we propose an AI Kill Switch technique that can immediately halt the operation of malicious web-based LLM agents. To achieve this, we introduce AutoGuard - the key idea is generating defensive prompts that trigger the safety mechanisms of malicious LLM agents. In particular, generated defense prompts are transparently embedded into the website's DOM so that they remain invisible to human users but can be detected by the crawling process of malicious agents, triggering its internal safety mechanisms to abort malicious actions once read. To evaluate our approach, we constructed a dedicated benchmark consisting of three representative malicious scenarios (PII collection, social rift content generation, and web hacking attempts). Experimental results show that the AutoGuard method achieves over 80% Defense Success Rate (DSR) on malicious agents, including GPT-4o, Claude-3, and Llama3.3-70B-Instruct. It also maintains strong performance, achieving around 90% DSR on GPT-5, GPT-4.1, and Gemini-2.5-Flash when used as the malicious agent, demonstrating robust generalization across models and scenarios.

However, these single-filter models suffer from a \"compromise\" problem, as their single adaptive parameter (e.g., alpha) must learn a suboptimal, averaged response across the entire graph spectrum. In this paper, we propose DualLaguerreNet, a novel GNN architecture that solves this by introducing \"Decoupled Spectral Flexibility.\" DualLaguerreNet splits the graph Laplacian into two operators, L_low (low-frequency) and L_high (high-frequency), and learns two independent, adaptive Laguerre polynomial filters, parameterized by alpha_1 and alpha_2, respectively. This work, however, uncovers a deeper finding. While our experiments show DualLaguerreNet's flexibility allows it to achieve state-of-the-art results on complex heterophilic tasks (outperforming LaguerreNet), it simultaneously underperforms on simpler, homophilic tasks. We identify this as a fundamental \"Flexibility-Stability Trade-off\". The increased parameterization (2x filter parameters and 2x model parameters) leads to overfitting on simple tasks, demonstrating that the \"compromise\" of simpler models acts as a crucial regularizer. This paper presents a new SOTA architecture for heterophily while providing a critical analysis of the bias-variance trade-off inherent in adaptive GNN filter design.",

In addition to common bibliometric analysis tools, a variant of a citation network was developed, and topic modelling was conducted. The analysis reveals that research activity exhibited sporadic patterns prior to 2008, followed by a marked acceleration, characterised by a shift from conventional statistical and machine learning methodologies (e.g., ARIMA, SVM, and basic neural networks) to specialised deep learning architectures. Based on this insight, a connection to more general fields such as machine learning and time series modelling was established. In addition to modelling, spatial, linguistic, and modal biases were identified and findings from existing secondary literature were validated and quantified. This revealed existing gaps, such as constrained data fusion, open (multivariate) data, and underappreciated challenges related to model interpretability, cost-efficiency, and a balance between algorithmic performance and practical deployment considerations. In connection with the superordinate fields, the growth in relevance of foundation models is also noteworthy.",

In this paper, we propose DeepDefense, a novel defense framework that applies Gradient-Feature Alignment (GFA) regularization across multiple layers to suppress adversarial vulnerability. By aligning input gradients with internal feature representations, DeepDefense promotes a smoother loss landscape in tangential directions, thereby reducing the model's sensitivity to adversarial noise. We provide theoretical insights into how adversarial perturbation can be decomposed into radial and tangential components and demonstrate that alignment suppresses loss variation in tangential directions, where most attacks are effective. Empirically, our method achieves significant improvements in robustness across both gradient-based and optimization-based attacks. For example, on CIFAR-10, CNN models trained with DeepDefense outperform standard adversarial training by up to 15.2% under APGD attacks and 24.7% under FGSM attacks. Against optimization-based attacks such as DeepFool and EADEN, DeepDefense requires 20 to 30 times higher perturbation magnitudes to cause misclassification, indicating stronger decision boundaries and a flatter loss landscape. Our approach is architecture-agnostic, simple to implement, and highly effective, offering a promising direction for improving the adversarial robustness of deep learning models.",

We introduce SCALEX, a framework for scalable and automated exploration of diffusion model latent spaces. SCALEX extracts semantically meaningful directions from H-space using only natural language prompts, enabling zero-shot interpretation without retraining or labelling. This allows systematic comparison across arbitrary concepts and large-scale discovery of internal model associations. We show that SCALEX detects gender bias in profession prompts, ranks semantic alignment across identity descriptors, and reveals clustered conceptual structure without supervision.

        "abstract": "A Brain Computer Interface (BCI) connects the human brain to the outside world, providing a direct communication channel. Electroencephalography (EEG) signals are commonly used in BCIs to reflect cognitive patterns related to motor function activities. However, due to the multichannel nature of EEG signals, explicit information processing is crucial to lessen computational complexity in BCI systems. This study proposes an innovative method based on brain region-specific channel selection and multi-domain feature fusion to improve classification accuracy. The novelty of the proposed approach lies in region-based channel selection, where EEG channels are grouped according to their functional relevance to distinct brain regions. By selecting channels based on specific regions involved in motor imagery (MI) tasks, this technique eliminates irrelevant channels, reducing data dimensionality and improving computational efficiency. This also ensures that the extracted features are more reflective of the brain actual activity related to motor tasks. Three distinct feature extraction methods Common Spatial Pattern (CSP), Fuzzy C-means clustering, and Tangent Space Mapping (TSM), are applied to each group of channels based on their brain region. Each method targets different characteristics of the EEG signal: CSP focuses on spatial patterns, Fuzzy C means identifies clusters within the data, and TSM captures non-linear patterns in the signal. The combined feature vector is used to classify motor imagery tasks (left hand, right hand, and right foot) using Support Vector Machine (SVM). The proposed method was validated on publicly available benchmark EEG datasets (IVA and I) from the BCI competition III and IV. The results show that the approach outperforms existing methods, achieving classification accuracies of 90.77% and 84.50% for datasets IVA and I, respectively.",

Recent studies demonstrate that fine-tuned LLMs can accurately predict vehicle trajectories and lane-change intentions by gathering and transforming data from surrounding vehicles. However, the robustness of such LLM-based prediction models for safety-critical driving systems remains unexplored, despite the increasing concerns about the trustworthiness of LLMs. This study addresses this gap by conducting a systematic vulnerability analysis of LLM-enabled vehicle trajectory prediction. We propose a one-feature differential evolution attack that perturbs a single kinematic feature of surrounding vehicles within the LLM's input prompts under a black-box setting. Experiments on the highD dataset reveal that even minor, physically plausible perturbations can significantly disrupt model outputs, underscoring the susceptibility of LLM-based predictors to adversarial manipulation. Further analyses reveal a trade-off between accuracy and robustness, examine the failure mechanism, and explore potential mitigation solutions. The findings provide the very first insights into adversarial vulnerabilities of LLM-driven automated vehicle models in the context of vehicular interactions and highlight the need for robustness-oriented design in future LLM-based intelligent transportation systems.",

        "abstract": "Multimodal learning aims to improve performance by leveraging data from multiple sources. During joint multimodal training, due to modality bias, the advantaged modality often dominates backpropagation, leading to imbalanced optimization. Existing methods still face two problems: First, the long-term dominance of the dominant modality weakens representation-output coupling in the late stages of training, resulting in the accumulation of redundant information. Second, previous methods often directly and uniformly adjust the gradients of the advantaged modality, ignoring the semantics and directionality between modalities. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive Redundancy Regulation for Balanced Multimodal Information Refinement (RedReg), which is inspired by information bottleneck principle. Specifically, we construct a redundancy phase monitor that uses a joint criterion of effective gain growth rate and redundancy to trigger intervention only when redundancy is high. Furthermore, we design a co-information gating mechanism to estimate the contribution of the current dominant modality based on cross-modal semantics. When the task primarily relies on a single modality, the suppression term is automatically disabled to preserve modality-specific information. Finally, we project the gradient of the dominant modality onto the orthogonal complement of the joint multimodal gradient subspace and suppress the gradient according to redundancy. Experiments show that our method demonstrates superiority among current major methods in most scenarios. Ablation experiments verify the effectiveness of our method.

        "abstract": "Probabilistic forecasting is not only a way to add more information to a prediction of the future, but it also builds on weaknesses in point prediction. Sudden changes in a time series can still be captured by a cumulative distribution function (CDF), while a point prediction is likely to miss it entirely. The modeling of CDFs within forecasts has historically been limited to parametric approaches, but due to recent advances, this no longer has to be the case. We aim to advance the fields of probabilistic forecasting and monotonic networks by connecting them and propose an approach that permits the forecasting of implicit, complete, and nonparametric CDFs. For this purpose, we propose an adaptation to deep lattice networks (DLN) for monotonically constrained simultaneous/implicit quantile regression in time series forecasting. Quantile regression usually produces quantile crossovers, which need to be prevented to achieve a legitimate CDF. By leveraging long short term memory units (LSTM) as the embedding layer, and spreading quantile inputs to all sub-lattices of a DLN with an extended output size, we can produce a multi-horizon forecast of an implicit CDF due to the monotonic constraintability of DLNs that prevent quantile crossovers. We compare and evaluate our approach's performance to relevant state of the art within the context of a highly relevant application of time series forecasting: Day-ahead, hourly forecasts of solar irradiance observations. Our experiments show that the adaptation of a DLN performs just as well or even better than an unconstrained approach. Further comparison of the adapted DLN against a scalable monotonic neural network shows that our approach performs better. With this adaptation of DLNs, we intend to create more interest and crossover investigations in techniques of monotonic neural networks and probabilistic forecasting.",

However, these models often produce chemically invalid molecules, which limits the usable scope of the learned chemical space and poses significant challenges for practical applications. To address this issue, we propose ChemFixer, a framework designed to correct invalid molecules into valid ones. ChemFixer is built on a transformer architecture, pre-trained using masking techniques, and fine-tuned on a large-scale dataset of valid/invalid molecular pairs that we constructed. Through comprehensive evaluations across diverse generative models, ChemFixer improved molecular validity while effectively preserving the chemical and biological distributional properties of the original outputs. This indicates that ChemFixer can recover molecules that could not be previously generated, thereby expanding the diversity of potential drug candidates. Furthermore, ChemFixer was effectively applied to a drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction task using limited data, improving the validity of generated ligands and discovering promising ligand-protein pairs. These results suggest that ChemFixer is not only effective in data-limited scenarios, but also extensible to a wide range of downstream tasks. Taken together, ChemFixer shows promise as a practical tool for various stages of deep learning-based drug discovery, enhancing molecular validity and expanding accessible chemical space.",

Un-labeled data on which the classifier and MA-VLMs agree are designated as the Agreed-Unknown set, while conflicting samples form the Disagreed-Unknown set. To enhance label reliability, MA-VLMs simulate dual perspectives, moderator and user, capturing both regulatory and subjective viewpoints. The classifier is optimized using a novel Positive-Negative-Unlabeled (PNU) loss, which jointly exploits labeled, Agreed-Unknown, and Disagreed-Unknown data while mitigating pseudo-label noise.

The model trade-offs introduced by this shift remain underexplored, and our goal is to study them. We use the open-source nanochat project, a compact 8K-line full-stack ChatGPT-like implementation containing tokenization, pretraining, fine-tuning, and serving, as a controlled baseline. We implement the DiLoCo algorithm as a lightweight wrapper over nanochat's training loop, performing multiple local steps per worker before synchronization with an outer optimizer, effectively reducing communication by orders of magnitude. This inner-outer training is compared against a standard data-parallel (DDP) setup. Because nanochat is small and inspectable, it enables controlled pipeline adaptations and allows direct comparison with the conventional centralized baseline. DiLoCo achieves stable convergence and competitive loss in pretraining but yields worse MMLU, GSM8K, and HumanEval scores after mid-training and SFT. We discover that using DiLoCo-pretrained weights and running mid- and post-training with DDP fails to recover performance, revealing irreversible representation drift from asynchronous updates that impairs downstream alignment. We provide this implementation as an official fork of nanochat on GitHub.",

In contrast, tokens, which play essential roles in many research fields, exhibit similar characteristics of growth, yet investigations into their incremental learning remain significantly scarce. This research gap primarily stems from the holistic nature of tokens in language, which imposes significant challenges on the design of incremental learning frameworks for them. To overcome this obstacle, in this work, we turn to a type of token, gene, for a large-scale biological dataset--single-cell transcriptomics--to formulate a pipeline for gene incremental learning and establish corresponding evaluations. We found that the forgetting problem also exists in gene incremental learning, thus we adapted existing class incremental learning methods to mitigate the forgetting of genes. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrated the soundness of our framework design and evaluations, as well as the effectiveness of our method adaptations. Finally, we provide a complete benchmark for gene incremental learning in single-cell transcriptomics.",

Recent approaches attempt to estimate rewards for unlabeled datasets using a small set of expert demonstrations.

We propose PROF, a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate and improve executable reward function codes from natural language descriptions and a single expert trajectory. We propose Reward Preference Ranking (RPR), a novel reward function quality assessment and ranking strategy without requiring environment interactions or RL training. RPR calculates the dominance scores of the reward functions, where higher scores indicate better alignment with expert preferences. By alternating between RPR and text-based gradient optimization, PROF fully automates the selection and refinement of optimal reward functions for downstream policy learning. Empirical results on D4RL demonstrate that PROF surpasses or matches recent strong baselines across numerous datasets and domains, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.",

Instead of a single softmax probability distribution, CREDIT predicts class-wise probability intervals that define a credal set, a convex set of probability distributions, for uncertainty quantification.

We demonstrate that students benefit from softer probabilities early in training but require sharper probabilities in later stages. We introduce Dynamic Temperature Scheduler (DTS), which adjusts temperature dynamically based on the cross-entropy loss gap between teacher and student. To our knowledge, this is the first temperature scheduling method that adapts based on the divergence between teacher and student distributions. Our method integrates seamlessly with existing KD frameworks. We validate DTS across multiple KD strategies on vision (CIFAR-100, Tiny-ImageNet) and NLP tasks (GLUE, Dolly, SelfIns, UnNI, S-NI), consistently outperforming static-temperature baselines.

However, when unknown samples are semantically similar to known classes, inter-class overlap in the feature space often causes models to assign unjustifiably high confidence to them, leading to misclassification as known classes -- a phenomenon known as overconfidence. This overconfidence undermines OSR by blurring the decision boundary between known and unknown classes. To address this issue, we propose a framework that explicitly mitigates overconfidence caused by inter-class overlap. The framework consists of two components: a perturbation-based uncertainty estimation module, which applies controllable parameter perturbations to generate diverse predictions and quantify predictive uncertainty, and an unknown detection module with distinct learning-based classifiers, implemented as a two-stage procedure, which leverages the estimated uncertainty to improve discrimination between known and unknown classes, thereby enhancing OSR performance. Experimental results on three public datasets show that the proposed framework achieves superior performance over existing OSR methods.",

        "abstract": "Mobile devices increasingly require the parallel execution of several computing tasks offloaded at the wireless edge. Existing communication systems only support parallel transmissions at the bit level, which fundamentally limits the number of tasks that can be concurrently processed. To address this bottleneck, this paper introduces the new concept of Semantic Multiplexing. Our approach shifts stream multiplexing from bits to tasks by merging multiple task-related compressed representations into a single semantic representation. As such, Semantic Multiplexing can multiplex more tasks than the number of physical channels without adding antennas or widening bandwidth by extending the effective degrees of freedom at the semantic layer, without contradicting Shannon capacity rules. We have prototyped Semantic Multiplexing on an experimental testbed with Jetson Orin Nano and millimeter-wave software-defined radios and tested its performance on image classification and sentiment analysis while comparing to several existing baselines in semantic communications. Our experiments demonstrate that Semantic Multiplexing allows jointly processing multiple tasks at the semantic level while maintaining sufficient task accuracy. For example, image classification accuracy drops by less than 4% when increasing from 2 to 8 the number of tasks multiplexed over a 4$\\times$4 channel. Semantic Multiplexing reduces latency, energy consumption, and communication load respectively by up to 8$\\times$, 25$\\times$, and 54$\\times$ compared to the baselines while keeping comparable performance. We pledge to publicly share the complete software codebase and the collected datasets for reproducibility.",

The method is policy-independent, interpretable, and leverages a widely used traffic engineering statistic. We validate the approach on 20 simulated scenarios using both a NEMA actuated controller and a reinforcement learning controller (FRAP++). Results show that larger scenario distances consistently correspond to increased travel time and reduced throughput, with particularly strong explanatory power for learning-based control. Overall, this method can predict performance degradation under distribution shift better than previously published techniques.

This study examines whether larger models can systematically jailbreak smaller ones - eliciting harmful or restricted behavior despite alignment safeguards. Using standardized adversarial tasks from JailbreakBench, we simulate over 6,000 multi-turn attacker-target exchanges across major LLM families and scales (0.6B-120B parameters), measuring both harm score and refusal behavior as indicators of adversarial potency and alignment integrity. Each interaction is evaluated through aggregated harm and refusal scores assigned by three independent LLM judges, providing a consistent, model-based measure of adversarial outcomes. Aggregating results across prompts, we find a strong and statistically significant correlation between mean harm and the logarithm of the attacker-to-target size ratio (Pearson r = 0.51, p < 0.001; Spearman rho = 0.52, p < 0.001), indicating that relative model size correlates with the likelihood and severity of harmful completions. Mean harm score variance is higher across attackers (0.18) than across targets (0.10), suggesting that attacker-side behavioral diversity contributes more to adversarial outcomes than target susceptibility. Attacker refusal frequency is strongly and negatively correlated with harm (rho = -0.93, p < 0.001), showing that attacker-side alignment mitigates harmful responses. These findings reveal that size asymmetry influences robustness and provide exploratory evidence for adversarial scaling patterns, motivating more controlled investigations into inter-model alignment and safety.",

The design of backdoor triggers has evolved from fixed triggers to dynamic or implicit triggers. This increased flexibility in trigger design makes it challenging for defenders to identify their specific forms accurately. Most existing backdoor defense methods are limited to specific types of triggers or rely on an additional clean model for support. To address this issue, we propose a backdoor detection method based on attention similarity, enabling backdoor detection without prior knowledge of the trigger. Our study reveals that models subjected to backdoor attacks exhibit unusually high similarity among attention heads when exposed to triggers. Based on this observation, we propose an attention safety alignment approach combined with head-wise fine-tuning to rectify potentially contaminated attention heads, thereby effectively mitigating the impact of backdoor attacks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly reduces the success rate of backdoor attacks while preserving the model's performance on downstream tasks.",

Among these, the CNN achieved the highest validation accuracy of 91.8%, demonstrating the effectiveness of localized motif detection. Explainable AI techniques, including Grad-CAM and Integrated Gradients, were applied to interpret model predictions and identify biologically meaningful sequence motifs. The discovered motifs, enriched in histidine, aspartate, glutamate, and lysine, represent amino acid residues commonly found in catalytic and metal-binding regions of transferase enzymes.

Existing approaches often focus either on technical aspects, such as datasets and models, or on high-level socio-ethical considerations - rarely capturing how these elements interact in practice. In this paper, we apply an information flow-based modeling framework to a real-world recruitment process that integrates automated candidate matching with human decision-making. Through semi-structured stakeholder interviews and iterative modeling, we construct a multi-level representation of the recruitment pipeline, capturing how information is transformed, filtered, and interpreted across both algorithmic and human components. We identify where biases may emerge, how they can propagate through the system, and what downstream impacts they may have on candidates. This case study illustrates how information flow modeling can support structured analysis of fairness risks, providing transparency across complex socio-technical systems.",

        "abstract": "Real-time crash detection is essential for developing proactive safety management strategy and enhancing overall traffic efficiency. To address the limitations associated with trajectory acquisition and vehicle tracking, road segment maps recording the individual-level traffic dynamic data were directly served in crash detection. A novel two-stage trajectory-free crash detection framework, was present to generate the rational future road segment map and identify crashes. The first-stage diffusion-based segment map generation model, Mapfusion, conducts a noisy-to-normal process that progressively adds noise to the road segment map until the map is corrupted to pure Gaussian noise. The denoising process is guided by sequential embedding components capturing the temporal dynamics of segment map sequences. Furthermore, the generation model is designed to incorporate background context through ControlNet to enhance generation control. Crash detection is achieved by comparing the monitored segment map with the generations from diffusion model in second stage. Trained on non-crash vehicle motion data, Mapfusion successfully generates realistic road segment evolution maps based on learned motion patterns and remains robust across different sampling intervals. Experiments on real-world crashes indicate the effectiveness of the proposed two-stage method in accurately detecting crashes.",

However, capturing the complex spatial and temporal dependencies of HIV transmission remains challenging. Conventional Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) models rely on a fixed binary adjacency matrix that only encodes geographic adjacency, which is unable to represent interactions between non-contiguous counties. Our study proposes a deep learning architecture Mobility-Aware Transformer-Message Passing Neural Network (MAT-MPNN) framework to predict county-level HIV diagnosis rates across California, Florida, and the New England region. The model combines temporal features extracted by a Transformer encoder with spatial relationships captured through a Mobility Graph Generator (MGG). The MGG improves conventional adjacency matrices by combining geographic and demographic information. Compared with the best-performing hybrid baseline, the Transformer MPNN model, MAT-MPNN reduced the Mean Squared Prediction Error (MSPE) by 27.9% in Florida, 39.1% in California, and 12.5% in New England, and improved the Predictive Model Choice Criterion (PMCC) by 7.7%, 3.5%, and 3.9%, respectively. MAT-MPNN also achieved better results than the Spatially Varying Auto-Regressive (SVAR) model in Florida and New England, with comparable performance in California. These results demonstrate that applying mobility-aware dynamic spatial structures substantially enhances predictive accuracy and calibration in spatiotemporal epidemiological prediction.",

        "abstract": "We target passive dementia screening from short camera-facing talking head video, developing a facial temporal micro dynamics analysis for language free detection of early neuro cognitive change. This enables unscripted, in the wild video analysis at scale to capture natural facial behaviors, transferrable across devices, topics, and cultures without active intervention by clinicians or researchers during recording. Most existing resources prioritize speech or scripted interviews, limiting use outside clinics and coupling predictions to language and transcription. In contrast, we identify and analyze whether temporal facial kinematics, including blink dynamics, small mouth jaw motions, gaze variability, and subtle head adjustments, are sufficient for dementia screening without speech or text. By stabilizing facial signals, we convert these micro movements into interpretable facial microdynamic time series, smooth them, and summarize short windows into compact clip level statistics for screening. Each window is encoded by its activity mix (the relative share of motion across streams), thus the predictor analyzes the distribution of motion across streams rather than its magnitude, making per channel effects transparent. We also introduce YT DemTalk, a new dataset curated from publicly available, in the wild camera facing videos. It contains 300 clips (150 with self reported dementia, 150 controls) to test our model and offer a first benchmarking of the corpus. On YT DemTalk, ablations identify gaze lability and mouth/jaw dynamics as the most informative cues, and light weighted shallow classifiers could attain a dementia prediction performance of (AUROC) 0.953, 0.961 Average Precision (AP), 0.851 F1-score, and 0.857 accuracy.",

Although the current post hoc explanation methods offer valuable insights into feature importance, they are inherently disconnected from the model training process, limiting their faithfulness and utility. In this work, we introduce a novel differentiable approach to global explainability by design, integrating feature importance estimation directly into model training. Central to our method is the ScoresActivation function, a feature-ranking mechanism embedded within the learning pipeline. This integration enables models to prioritize features according to their contribution to predictive performance in a differentiable and end-to-end trainable manner. Evaluations across benchmark datasets show that our approach yields globally faithful, stable feature rankings aligned with SHAP values and ground-truth feature importance, while maintaining high predictive performance. Moreover, feature scoring is 150 times faster than the classical SHAP method, requiring only 2 seconds during training compared to SHAP's 300 seconds for feature ranking in the same configuration. Our method also improves classification accuracy by 11.24% with 10 features (5 relevant) and 29.33% with 16 features (5 relevant, 11 irrelevant), demonstrating robustness to irrelevant inputs. This work bridges the gap between model accuracy and interpretability, offering a scalable framework for inherently explainable machine learning.",

The proposed model is differentiated from traditional transfer learning methods as it incorporates a Pseudo-Newton Boosting layer along with a Sparsity-Induced Feature Reduction Layer that forms a multi-tiered framework, further improving feature selection and representation. The Pseudo-Newton Boosting layer makes smart variations of feature weights, with more detailed anatomical features, which are mostly left out in a transfer learning setup. In addition, the Sparsity-Induced Layer removes redundancy for learned features, producing lean yet robust representations for pathology in the lumbar spine. This architecture is novel as it overcomes the constraints in the traditional transfer learning approach, especially in the high-dimensional context of medical images, and achieves a significant performance boost, reaching a precision of 0.9, recall of 0.861, F1 score of 0.88, loss of 0.18, and an accuracy of 88.1%, compared to the baseline model, EfficientNet.

To study the impact of this phenomenon in a real-world application setting, we introduce GM-Extract, a novel benchmark dataset meticulously designed to evaluate LLM performance on retrieval of control variables. To accurately diagnose failure modes, we propose a simple yet elegant evaluation system using two distinct metrics: one for spatial retrieval capability (Document Metric) and the other for semantic retrieval capability (Variable Extraction Metric). We conduct a systematic evaluation of 7-8B parameter models on two multi-document tasks (key-value extraction and question-answering), demonstrating a significant change in retrieval performance simply by altering how the data is represented in the context window. While a distinct U-shaped curve was not consistently observed, our analysis reveals a clear pattern of performance across models, which we further correlate with perplexity scores. Furthermore, we perform a literature survey of mitigation methods, which we categorize into two distinct approaches: black-box and white-box methods. We then apply these techniques to our benchmark, finding that their efficacy is highly nuanced. Our evaluation highlights scenarios where these strategies successfully improve performance, as well as surprising cases where they lead to a negative impact, providing a comprehensive understanding of their utility in a practical context.",

By leveraging device dynamics and diagonalized state transition parameters, the state evolution can be natively implemented in crossbar-based CIM systems combined with memristors exhibiting short-term memory effects.

We identify three critical patterns: (1) the emergence of multi-dimensional evaluation strategies combining synthetic, automated, and human preferences; (2) inconsistent alignment between traditional metrics (WER, PESQ) and human judgments across different contexts; and (3) convergence on multi-stage training pipelines that combine reward signals. Our findings suggest that while preference learning shows promise for audio, particularly in capturing subjective qualities like naturalness and musicality, the field requires standardized benchmarks, higher-quality datasets, and systematic investigation of how temporal factors unique to audio impact preference learning frameworks.",

        "abstract": "Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising approach for learning interpretable features from neural network activations. However, the optimization landscape for SAE training can be challenging due to correlations in the input data. We demonstrate that applying PCA Whitening to input activations -- a standard preprocessing technique in classical sparse coding -- improves SAE performance across multiple metrics. Through theoretical analysis and simulation, we show that whitening transforms the optimization landscape, making it more convex and easier to navigate. We evaluate both ReLU and Top-K SAEs across diverse model architectures, widths, and sparsity regimes. Empirical evaluation on SAEBench, a comprehensive benchmark for sparse autoencoders, reveals that whitening consistently improves interpretability metrics, including sparse probing accuracy and feature disentanglement, despite minor drops in reconstruction quality. Our results challenge the assumption that interpretability aligns with an optimal sparsity--fidelity trade-off and suggest that whitening should be considered as a default preprocessing step for SAE training, particularly when interpretability is prioritized over perfect reconstruction.",

Our approach proceeds in two stages. First, we introduce a semantically aware labeling algorithm that, given a generated SQL and a gold reference, assigns node-level correctness without over-penalizing structural containers or alias variation. Second, we represent each node with a rich set of schema-aware and lexical features - capturing identifier validity, alias resolution, type compatibility, ambiguity in scope, and typo signals - and train a supervised classifier to predict per-node error probabilities. We interpret these probabilities as calibrated uncertainty, enabling fine-grained diagnostics that pinpoint exactly where a query is likely to be wrong. Across multiple databases and datasets, our method substantially outperforms token log-probabilities: average AUC improves by +27.44% while maintaining robustness under cross-database evaluation. Beyond serving as an accuracy signal, node-level uncertainty supports targeted repair, human-in-the-loop review, and downstream selective execution. Together, these results establish node-centric, semantically grounded uncertainty estimation as a strong and interpretable alternative to aggregate sequence level confidence measures.",

While existing benchmarks like LoCoBench~\\cite{qiu2025locobench} assess long-context code understanding, they focus on single-turn evaluation and cannot capture the multi-turn interactive nature, tool usage patterns, and adaptive reasoning required by real-world coding agents. We introduce \\textbf{LoCoBench-Agent}, a comprehensive evaluation framework specifically designed to assess LLM agents in realistic, long-context software engineering workflows. Our framework extends LoCoBench's 8,000 scenarios into interactive agent environments, enabling systematic evaluation of multi-turn conversations, tool usage efficiency, error recovery, and architectural consistency across extended development sessions. We also introduce an evaluation methodology with 9 metrics across comprehension and efficiency dimensions. Our framework provides agents with 8 specialized tools (file operations, search, code analysis) and evaluates them across context lengths ranging from 10K to 1M tokens, enabling precise assessment of long-context performance. Through systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art models, we reveal several key findings: (1) agents exhibit remarkable long-context robustness; (2) comprehension-efficiency trade-off exists with negative correlation, where thorough exploration increases comprehension but reduces efficiency; and (3) conversation efficiency varies dramatically across models, with strategic tool usage patterns differentiating high-performing agents. As the first long-context LLM agent benchmark for software engineering, LoCoBench-Agent establishes a rigorous foundation for measuring agent capabilities, identifying performance gaps, and advancing autonomous software development at scale.",

Bayesian structure learners approach this problem by inferring a posterior distribution over the possible directed acyclic graphs underlying the BN. The inference process often requires marginalizing over probability distributions, which is typically done using dynamic programming methods that restrict the set of possible parents for each node. Instead, we present a novel method that utilizes tractable probabilistic circuits to circumvent this restriction. This method utilizes a new learning routine that trains these circuits on both the original distribution and marginal queries. The architecture of probabilistic circuits then inherently allows for fast and exact marginalization on the learned distribution. We then show empirically that utilizing our method to answer marginals allows Bayesian structure learners to improve their performance compared to current methods.",

We present FlakyGuard, which addresses this problem by treating code as a graph structure and using selective graph exploration to find only the most relevant context. Evaluation on real-world flaky tests from industrial repositories shows that FlakyGuard repairs 47.6 % of reproducible flaky tests with 51.8 % of the fixes accepted by developers. Besides it outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by at least 22 % in repair success rate. Developer surveys confirm that 100 % find FlakyGuard's root cause explanations useful.",

Accordingly, it remains unclear how and to what extent AI can accelerate innovation. To help to fill this gap, we report results from 32 interviews with U.S.-based academic manufacturing and materials sciences researchers experienced with AI and machine learning (ML) techniques. Interviewees primarily used AI for modeling of materials and manufacturing processes, facilitating cheaper and more rapid search of design spaces for materials and manufacturing processes alike. They report benefits including cost, time, and computation savings in technology development. However, interviewees also report that AI/ML tools are unreliable outside design spaces for which dense data are already available; that they require skilled and judicious application in tandem with older research techniques; and that AI/ML tools may detrimentally circumvent opportunities for disruptive theoretical advancement. Based on these results, we suggest there is reason for optimism about acceleration in sustaining innovations through the use of to AI/ML; but that support for conventional empirical, computational, and theoretical research is required to maintain the likelihood of further major advances in manufacturing and materials science.",

The framework integrates a Mixture-of-Retrieval mechanism that dynamically routes queries across hazard-specific databases while using agentic chunking to preserve contextual coherence during retrieval. It also includes a verification loop that assesses evidence sufficiency, refines queries, and initiates targeted searches when information remains incomplete. We construct HazardRecQA by deriving question-answer pairs from GEER reconnaissance reports, which document 90 global events across seven major hazard types. MoRA-RAG achieves up to 94.5 percent accuracy, outperforming zero-shot LLMs by 30 percent and state-of-the-art RAG systems by 10 percent, while reducing hallucinations across diverse LLM architectures. MoRA-RAG also enables open-weight LLMs to achieve performance comparable to proprietary models.

        "abstract": "Recent work has shown that fine-tuning on insecure code data can trigger an emergent misalignment (EMA) phenomenon, where models generate malicious responses even to prompts unrelated to the original insecure code-writing task. Such cross-domain generalization of harmful behavior underscores the need for a deeper understanding of the algorithms, tasks, and datasets that induce emergent misalignment. In this work, we extend this study by demonstrating that emergent misalignment can also arise from narrow refusal unlearning in specific domains. We perform refusal unlearning on Cybersecurity and Safety concept, and evaluate EMA by monitoring refusal scores across seven responsible AI (RAI) domains, Cybersecurity, Safety, Toxicity, Bias, Sensitive Content, Medical/Legal, and Privacy. Our work shows that narrow domain unlearning can yield compliance responses for the targeted concept, however, it may also propagate EMA to unrelated domains. Among the two intervened concepts, Cybersecurity and Safety, we find that the safety concept can have larger EMA impact, i.e, causing lower refusal scores, across other unrelated domains such as bias. We observe this effect consistently across two model families, Mistral-7b-0.3v, and Qwen-7b-2.5. Further, we show that refusal unlearning augmented with cross-entropy loss function on a small set of retain data from the affected domains can largely, if not fully, restore alignment across the impacted domains while having lower refusal rate on the concept we perform unlearning on. To investigate the underlying causes of EMA, we analyze concept entanglements at the representation level via concept vectors. Our analysis reveals that concepts with higher representation similarity in earlier layers are more susceptible to EMA after intervention when the refusal stream is altered through targeted refusal unlearning.",

A model trained yesterday to map a developer's natural-language question to the exact set of repository file paths that matter will degrade tomorrow, even if the questions themselves look unchanged. In this paper we study, at system scale and across several widely used repositories, how to keep such a model fresh without surrendering retention on earlier code. We frame freshness as a form of domain drift between a base snapshot and the current HEAD, and we compare three families of update strategies: (A) Full Refresh, retraining the entire model at the new snapshot; (B) In-Context Learning (ICL) that injects recent deltas (raw git diffs or concise English summaries) at inference; and (C) Incremental Fine-Tuning (Inc-FT) on delta-derived training sets, with carefully controlled NEW:OLD mixing to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. We contribute an alias-aware evaluation protocol that credits rename while never rewarding deleted paths, and a practical Forgetting Probe that quantifies residual emissions of obsolete paths. Across Flask, SQLAlchemy, Pandas, and Poetry, Inc-FT with old-aware mixes delivers the best overall balance on mixed sets, ICL with English delta summaries delivers the fastest new-code lift when training is not feasible, and Full Refresh remains the ceiling when maximum NEW accuracy matters. We also compare Git-diff Inc-FT to full-file Inc-FT, showing that diffs excel in rename/delete-heavy windows while full-file context wins in behavior-change-heavy windows.",

        "abstract": "Membership inference attacks (MIAs) on large language models (LLMs) pose significant privacy risks across various stages of model training. Recent advances in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) have brought a profound paradigm shift in LLM training, particularly for complex reasoning tasks. However, the on-policy nature of RLVR introduces a unique privacy leakage pattern: since training relies on self-generated responses without fixed ground-truth outputs, membership inference must now determine whether a given prompt (independent of any specific response) is used during fine-tuning. This creates a threat where leakage arises not from answer memorization. To audit this novel privacy risk, we propose Divergence-in-Behavior Attack (DIBA), the first membership inference framework specifically designed for RLVR. DIBA shifts the focus from memorization to behavioral change, leveraging measurable shifts in model behavior across two axes: advantage-side improvement (e.g., correctness gain) and logit-side divergence (e.g., policy drift). Through comprehensive evaluations, we demonstrate that DIBA significantly outperforms existing baselines, achieving around 0.8 AUC and an order-of-magnitude higher TPR@0.1%FPR. We validate DIBA's superiority across multiple settings--including in-distribution, cross-dataset, cross-algorithm, black-box scenarios, and extensions to vision-language models.

        "abstract": "Generative models on curved spaces rely on charts to map Euclidean spaces to manifolds. Exponential maps preserve geodesics but have stiff, radius-dependent Jacobians, while volume-preserving charts maintain densities but distort geodesic distances. Both approaches entangle curvature with model parameters, inflating gradient variance. In high-dimensional latent normalizing flows, the wrapped exponential prior can stretch radii far beyond the curvature scale, leading to poor test likelihoods and stiff solvers. We introduce Radial Compensation (RC), an information-geometric method that selects the base density in the tangent space so that the likelihood depends only on geodesic distance from a pole, decoupling parameter semantics from curvature. RC lets radial parameters retain their usual meaning in geodesic units, while the chart can be tuned as a numerical preconditioner. We extend RC to manifolds with known geodesic polar volume and show that RC is the only construction for geodesic-radial likelihoods with curvature-invariant Fisher information. We derive the Balanced-Exponential (bExp) chart family, balancing volume distortion and geodesic error. Under RC, all bExp settings preserve the same manifold density and Fisher information, with smaller dial values reducing gradient variance and flow cost. Empirically, RC yields stable generative models across densities, VAEs, flows on images and graphs, and protein models. RC improves likelihoods, restores clean geodesic radii, and prevents radius blow-ups in high-dimensional flows, making RC-bExp a robust default for likelihood-trained generative models on manifolds.",

Traditional motion analysis systems are often expensive and intrusive, limiting their use in natural training environments. To address this limitation, we propose a machine learning-based multimodal framework that integrates wearable sensor data for simultaneous action recognition and stress estimation. Using a self-developed wrist-worn device equipped with an accelerometer and photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor, we collected synchronized motion and physiological data during real archery sessions. For motion recognition, we introduce a novel feature--Smoothed Differential Acceleration (SmoothDiff)--and employ a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to identify motion phases, achieving 96.8% accuracy and 95.9% F1-score. For stress estimation, we extract heart rate variability (HRV) features from PPG signals and apply a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier, achieving 80% accuracy in distinguishing high- and low-stress levels. The proposed framework demonstrates that integrating motion and physiological sensing can provide meaningful insights into athletes' technical and mental states. This approach offers a foundation for developing intelligent, real-time feedback systems for training optimization in archery and other precision sports.",

While existing approaches have made significant progress in learning medication representations, they suffer from two fundamental limitations: (i) treating medical entities as independent features without modeling their synergistic effects on medication selection; (ii) employing static causal relationships that fail to adapt to patient-specific contexts and health states. To address these challenges, we propose CafeMed, a framework that integrates dynamic causal reasoning with cross-modal attention for safe and accurate medication recommendation. CafeMed introduces two key components: the Causal Weight Generator (CWG) that transforms static causal effects into dynamic modulation weights based on individual patient states, and the Channel Harmonized Attention Refinement Module (CHARM) that captures complex interdependencies between diagnoses and procedures. This design enables CafeMed to model how different medical conditions jointly influence treatment decisions while maintaining medication safety constraints. Extensive experiments on MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets demonstrate that CafeMed significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving superior accuracy in medication prediction while maintaining the lower drug--drug interaction rates. Our results indicate that incorporating dynamic causal relationships and cross-modal synergies leads to more clinically-aligned and personalized medication recommendations.

During training, CFG stochastically alternates between conditional and null prompts to enable both conditional and unconditional generation. However, during sampling, CFG outputs both null and conditional prompts simultaneously, leading to inconsistent noise estimates between the training and sampling processes. To reduce this error, we propose CFG-EC, a versatile correction scheme augmentable to any CFG-based method by refining the unconditional noise predictions. CFG-EC actively realigns the unconditional noise error component to be orthogonal to the conditional error component. This corrective maneuver prevents interference between the two guidance components, thereby constraining the sampling error's upper bound and establishing more reliable guidance trajectories for high-fidelity image generation. Our numerical experiments show that CFG-EC handles the unconditional component more effectively than CFG and CFG++, delivering a marked performance increase in the low guidance sampling regime and consistently higher prompt alignment across the board.",

        "abstract": "Reliable measurement of glenoid bone loss is essential for operative planning in shoulder instability, but current manual and semi-automated methods are time-consuming and often subject to interreader variability. We developed and validated a fully automated deep learning pipeline for measuring glenoid bone loss on three-dimensional computed tomography (CT) scans using a linear-based, en-face view, best-circle method. Shoulder CT images of 91 patients (average age, 40 years; range, 14-89 years; 65 men) were retrospectively collected along with manual labels including glenoid segmentation, landmarks, and bone loss measurements. The multi-stage algorithm has three main stages: (1) segmentation, where we developed a U-Net to automatically segment the glenoid and humerus; (2) anatomical landmark detection, where a second network predicts glenoid rim points; and (3) geometric fitting, where we applied principal component analysis (PCA), projection, and circle fitting to compute the percentage of bone loss. The automated measurements showed strong agreement with consensus readings and exceeded surgeon-to-surgeon consistency (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) 0.84 vs 0.78), including in low- and high-bone-loss subgroups (ICC 0.71 vs 0.63 and 0.83 vs 0.21, respectively; P < 0.001). For classifying patients into low, medium, and high bone-loss categories, the pipeline achieved a recall of 0.714 for low and 0.857 for high severity, with no low cases misclassified as high or vice versa. These results suggest that our method is a time-efficient and clinically reliable tool for preoperative planning in shoulder instability and for screening patients with substantial glenoid bone loss.

GCA uses grouped coordinate modeling to jointly encode global dependencies across channels and spatial locations, strengthening feature representation and boundary delineation while adding minimal parameter and FLOP overhead compared with self-attention. On the Synapse dataset, GCA-ResUNet achieves a Dice score of 86.11%, and on the ACDC dataset, it reaches 92.64%, surpassing several state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining fast inference and favorable computational efficiency.

        "abstract": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) greatly enhances large language models (LLMs) performance in knowledge-intensive tasks. However, naive RAG methods struggle with multi-hop question answering due to their limited capacity to capture complex dependencies across documents. Recent studies employ graph-based RAG to capture document connections. However, these approaches often result in a loss of semantic coherence and introduce irrelevant noise during node matching and subgraph construction. To address these limitations, we propose NeuroPath, an LLM-driven semantic path tracking RAG framework inspired by the path navigational planning of place cells in neurobiology. It consists of two steps: Dynamic Path Tracking and Post-retrieval Completion. Dynamic Path Tracking performs goal-directed semantic path tracking and pruning over the constructed knowledge graph (KG), improving noise reduction and semantic coherence. Post-retrieval Completion further reinforces these benefits by conducting second-stage retrieval using intermediate reasoning and the original query to refine the query goal and complete missing information in the reasoning path. NeuroPath surpasses current state-of-the-art baselines on three multi-hop QA datasets, achieving average improvements of 16.3% on recall@2 and 13.5% on recall@5 over advanced graph-based RAG methods. Moreover, compared to existing iter-based RAG methods, NeuroPath achieves higher accuracy and reduces token consumption by 22.8%. Finally, we demonstrate the robustness of NeuroPath across four smaller LLMs (Llama3.1, GLM4, Mistral0.3, and Gemma3), and further validate its scalability across tasks of varying complexity.

We fine-tune two state-of-the-art transformer-based models, PLM-ICD and GKI-ICD, on both the original and extended datasets.

Standard practice collapses these label distributions into single labels, aggregating diverse human judgments into point estimates. We argue that this approach is epistemically misaligned for ambiguous data--the annotation distribution itself should be regarded as the ground truth. Training on collapsed single labels forces models to express false confidence on fundamentally ambiguous cases, creating a misalignment between model certainty and the diversity of human perception. We demonstrate empirically that soft-label training, which treats annotation distributions as ground truth, preserves epistemic uncertainty. Across both vision and NLP tasks, soft-label training achieves 32% lower KL divergence from human annotations and 61% stronger correlation between model and annotation entropy, while matching the accuracy of hard-label training. Our work repositions annotation distributions from noisy signals to be aggregated away, to faithful representations of epistemic uncertainty that models should learn to reproduce.",

Yet, current-generation EMS infrastructure remains constrained by one-to-one video streaming and limited analytics capabilities, leaving dispatchers and EMTs to manually interpret overwhelming, often noisy or redundant information in high-stress environments. We present TeleEMS, a mobile live video analytics system that enables pre-arrival multimodal inference by fusing audio and video into a unified decision-making pipeline before EMTs arrive on scene. TeleEMS comprises two key components: TeleEMS Client and TeleEMS Server. The TeleEMS Client runs across phones, smart glasses, and desktops to support bystanders, EMTs en route, and 911 dispatchers. The TeleEMS Server, deployed at the edge, integrates EMS-Stream, a communication backbone that enables smooth multi-party video streaming. On top of EMSStream, the server hosts three real-time analytics modules: (1) audio-to-symptom analytics via EMSLlama, a domain-specialized LLM for robust symptom extraction and normalization; (2) video-to-vital analytics using state-of-the-art rPPG methods for heart rate estimation; and (3) joint text-vital analytics via PreNet, a multimodal multitask model predicting EMS protocols, medication types, medication quantities, and procedures. Evaluation shows that EMSLlama outperforms GPT-4o (exact-match 0.89 vs. 0.57) and that text-vital fusion improves inference robustness, enabling reliable pre-arrival intervention recommendations. TeleEMS demonstrates the potential of mobile live video analytics to transform EMS operations, bridging the gap between bystanders, dispatchers, and EMTs, and paving the way for next-generation intelligent EMS infrastructure.",

        "abstract": "Enforcing a fair workload allocation among multiple agents tasked to achieve an objective in learning enabled demand side healthcare worker settings is crucial for consistent and reliable performance at runtime. Existing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approaches steer fairness by shaping reward through post hoc orchestrations, leaving no certifiable self-enforceable fairness that is immutable by individual agents at runtime. Contextualized within a setting where each agent shares resources with others, we address this shortcoming with a learning enabled optimization scheme among self-interested decision makers whose individual actions affect those of other agents. This extends the problem to a generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) game-theoretic framework where we steer group policy to a safe and locally efficient equilibrium, so that no agent can improve its utility function by unilaterally changing its decisions. Fair-GNE models MARL as a constrained generalized Nash equilibrium-seeking (GNE) game, prescribing an ideal equitable collective equilibrium within the problem's natural fabric. Our hypothesis is rigorously evaluated in our custom-designed high-fidelity resuscitation simulator. Across all our numerical experiments, Fair-GNE achieves significant improvement in workload balance over fixed-penalty baselines (0.89 vs.\\ 0.33 JFI, $p < 0.01$) while maintaining 86\\% task success, demonstrating statistically significant fairness gains through adaptive constraint enforcement. Our results communicate our formulations, evaluation metrics, and equilibrium-seeking innovations in large multi-agent learning-based healthcare systems with clarity and principled fairness enforcement.",

        "abstract": "Vision-language-action (VLA) models have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for building generalist robots. However, traditional VLA models that generate actions through flow matching (FM) typically rely on rigid and uniform time schedules, i.e., synchronous FM (SFM). Without action context awareness and asynchronous self-correction, SFM becomes unstable in long-horizon tasks, where a single action error can cascade into failure. In this work, we propose asynchronous flow matching VLA (AsyncVLA), a novel framework that introduces temporal flexibility in asynchronous FM (AFM) and enables self-correction in action generation. AsyncVLA breaks from the vanilla SFM in VLA models by generating the action tokens in a non-uniform time schedule with action context awareness. Besides, our method introduces the confidence rater to extract confidence of the initially generated actions, enabling the model to selectively refine inaccurate action tokens before execution. Moreover, we propose a unified training procedure for SFM and AFM that endows a single model with both modes, improving KV-cache utilization. Extensive experiments on robotic manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that AsyncVLA is data-efficient and exhibits self-correction ability. AsyncVLA achieves state-of-the-art results across general embodied evaluations due to its asynchronous generation in AFM. Our code is available at this https URL.",

To alleviate the issue of lacking high-quality data for model alignment, some works on weak-to-strong generalization (W2SG) finetune a strong pretrained model with a weak supervisor so that it can generalize beyond weak supervision. However, the invariable use of weak supervision in existing methods exposes issues in robustness, with a proportion of weak labels proving harmful to models. In this paper, we propose a selective W2SG framework to avoid using weak supervision when unnecessary. We train a binary classifier P(IK) to identify questions that a strong model can answer and use its self-generated labels for alignment. We further refine weak labels with a graph smoothing method. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms competitive baselines. Further analyses show that P(IK) can generalize across tasks and difficulties, which indicates selective W2SG can help superalignment.",

To address these challenges, we propose Certified Signed Graph Unlearning (CSGU), which provides provable privacy guarantees while preserving the sociological principles underlying SGNNs.

Yet, we lack a clear understanding of where these symbolic hallucinations originate, making it crucial to systematically handle such triggers and localize the emergence of hallucination inside the model. While prior work explored localization using statistical techniques like LSC and activation variance analysis, these methods treat all tokens equally and overlook the role symbolic linguistic knowledge plays in triggering hallucinations. So far, no approach has investigated how symbolic elements specifically drive hallucination failures across model layers, nor has symbolic linguistic knowledge been used as the foundation for a localization framework. We propose the first symbolic localization framework that leverages symbolic linguistic and semantic knowledge to meaningfully trace the development of hallucinations across all model layers. By focusing on how models process symbolic triggers, we analyze five models using HaluEval and TruthfulQA. Our symbolic knowledge approach reveals that attention variance for these linguistic elements explodes to critical instability in early layers (2-4), with negation triggering catastrophic variance levels, demonstrating that symbolic semantic processing breaks down from the very beginning. Through the lens of symbolic linguistic knowledge, despite larger model sizes, hallucination rates remain consistently high (78.3%-83.7% across Gemma variants), with steep attention drops for symbolic semantic triggers throughout deeper layers. Our findings demonstrate that hallucination is fundamentally a symbolic linguistic processing failure, not a general generation problem, revealing that symbolic semantic knowledge provides the key to understanding and localizing hallucination mechanisms in LLMs.",

We further establish a unified theoretical framework that rigorously connects BDL and EPS, providing formal theorems that decompose total predictive uncertainty into epistemic and aleatoric components under the hybrid BDL framework. We validate our framework on the large-scale 40-year ERA5 reanalysis dataset (1979-2019) with 0.25° spatial resolution.

Text-based methods typically encode item textual information via prompt design and generate discrete semantic IDs through item tokenization. However, in domain-specific tasks such as local-life services, simply injecting location information into prompts fails to capture fine-grained spatial characteristics and real-world distance awareness among items. To address this, we propose LGSID, an LLM-Aligned Geographic Item Tokenization Framework for Local-life Recommendation. This framework consists of two key components: (1) RL-based Geographic LLM Alignment, and (2) Hierarchical Geographic Item Tokenization. In the RL-based alignment module, we initially train a list-wise reward model to capture real-world spatial relationships among items. We then introduce a novel G-DPO algorithm that uses pre-trained reward model to inject generalized spatial knowledge and collaborative signals into LLMs while preserving their semantic understanding. Furthermore, we propose a hierarchical geographic item tokenization strategy, where primary tokens are derived from discrete spatial and content attributes, and residual tokens are refined using the aligned LLM's geographic representation vectors. Extensive experiments on real-world Kuaishou industry datasets show that LGSID consistently outperforms state-of-the-art discriminative and generative recommendation models.

Arabic has a complicated morphological and syntactic structure, posing a greater challenge than other languages. Even though modern neural models have improved greatly in recent years, the majority of previous attempts used individual models without taking into account the potential benefits of combining different systems. In this paper, we present one of the first multi-system approaches for correcting grammatical errors in Arabic, the Arab Enhanced Edit Selection System Complication (ArbESC+). Several models are used to collect correction proposals, which are represented as numerical features in the framework. A classifier determines and implements the appropriate corrections based on these features. In order to improve output quality, the framework uses support techniques to filter overlapping corrections and estimate decision reliability. A combination of AraT5, ByT5, mT5, AraBART, AraBART+Morph+GEC, and Text editing systems gave better results than a single model alone, with F0.5 at 82.63% on QALB-14 test data, 84.64% on QALB-15 L1 data, and 65.55% on QALB-15 L2 data. As one of the most significant contributions of this work, it's the first Arab attempt to integrate linguistic error correction. Improving existing models provides a practical step towards developing advanced tools that will benefit users and researchers of Arabic text processing.",

STICA represents each observation as a set of object-centric tokens, together with tokens for the agent action and the resulting reward, enabling the world model to predict token-level dynamics and interactions. The policy and value networks then estimate token-level cause--effect relations and use them in the attention layers, yielding causality-guided decision-making. Experiments on object-rich benchmarks demonstrate that STICA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art agents in both sample efficiency and final performance.",

Recently, one-shot pruning has emerged as an effective strategy for reducing model size without additional training. However, models trained with standard objective functions often suffer a significant drop in accuracy after aggressive pruning. Some existing pruning-robust optimizers, such as SAM, and CrAM, mitigate this accuracy drop by guiding the model toward flatter regions of the parameter space, but they inevitably incur non-negligible additional computations. We propose a Variance Amplifying Regularizer (VAR) that deliberately increases the variance of model parameters during training. Our study reveals an intriguing finding that parameters with higher variance exhibit greater pruning robustness. VAR exploits this property by promoting such variance in the weight distribution, thereby mitigating the adverse effects of pruning. We further provide a theoretical analysis of its convergence behavior, supported by extensive empirical results demonstrating the superior pruning robustness of VAR.",

Evaluating 35 Arabic and bilingual LLMs reveals that current models demonstrate strong surface level proficiency but struggle with deeper grammatical and syntactic reasoning.

        "abstract": "Language-conditioned manipulation facilitates human-robot interaction via behavioral cloning (BC), which learns control policies from human demonstrations and serves as a cornerstone of embodied AI. Overcoming compounding errors in sequential action decisions remains a central challenge to improving BC performance. Existing approaches mitigate compounding errors through data augmentation, expressive representation, or temporal abstraction. However, they suffer from physical discontinuities and semantic-physical misalignment, leading to inaccurate action cloning and intermittent execution. In this paper, we present Continuous vision-language-action Co-Learning with Semantic-Physical Alignment (CCoL), a novel BC framework that ensures temporally consistent execution and fine-grained semantic grounding. It generates robust and smooth action execution trajectories through continuous co-learning across vision, language, and proprioceptive inputs (e.g., robot internal states). Meanwhile, we anchor language semantics to visuomotor representations by a bidirectional cross-attention to learn contextual information for action generation, successfully overcoming the problem of semantic-physical misalignment. Extensive experiments show that CCoL achieves an average 8.0% relative improvement across three simulation suites, with up to 19.2% relative gain in human-demonstrated bimanual insertion tasks. Real-world tests on a 7-DoF robot further confirm CCoL's generalization under unseen and noisy object states.",

Although this enhances client-side privacy, it also leaves the server highly vulnerable to model theft by malicious clients. Ensuring intellectual property protection for such capability-limited servers presents a dual challenge: watermarking schemes that depend on client cooperation are unreliable in adversarial settings, whereas traditional server-side watermarking schemes are technically infeasible because the server lacks access to critical elements such as model parameters or labels. To address this challenge, this paper proposes Sigil, a mandatory watermarking framework designed specifically for capability-limited servers. Sigil defines the watermark as a statistical constraint on the server-visible activation space and embeds the watermark into the client model via gradient injection, without requiring any knowledge of the data. Besides, we design an adaptive gradient clipping mechanism to ensure that our watermarking process remains both mandatory and stealthy, effectively countering existing gradient anomaly detection methods and a specifically designed adaptive subspace removal attack. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and models demonstrate Sigil's fidelity, robustness, and stealthiness.",

However, most of these models don't have the ability to change the number of atoms in the crystal during the generation process, which limits the variability of model sampling trajectories. In this paper, we demonstrate the severity of this restriction and introduce a simple yet powerful technique, mirage infusion, which enables diffusion models to change the state of the atoms that make up the crystal from existent to non-existent (mirage) and vice versa. We show that this technique improves model quality by up to $\\times2.5$ compared to the same model without this modification. The resulting model, Mirage Atom Diffusion (MiAD), is an equivariant joint diffusion model for de novo crystal generation that is capable of altering the number of atoms during the generation process. MiAD achieves an $8.2\\%$ S.U.N. rate on the MP-20 dataset, which substantially exceeds existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Formal methods provide strong guarantees but depend on complete models and static assumptions. Runtime verification (RV) complements them by monitoring executions at run time and, in its predictive variants, by anticipating potential violations. Large language models (LLMs), meanwhile, excel at translating natural language into formal artefacts and recognising patterns in data, yet they remain error-prone and lack formal guarantees. This vision paper argues for a symbiotic integration of RV and LLMs. RV can serve as a guardrail for LLM-driven autonomy, while LLMs can extend RV by assisting specification capture, supporting anticipatory reasoning, and helping to handle uncertainty. We outline how this mutual reinforcement differs from existing surveys and roadmaps, discuss challenges and certification implications, and identify future research directions towards dependable autonomy.",

        "abstract": "Continuous cardiovascular monitoring can play a key role in precision health. However, some fundamental cardiac biomarkers of interest, including stroke volume and cardiac output, require invasive measurements, e.g., arterial pressure waveforms (APW). As a non-invasive alternative, photoplethysmography (PPG) measurements are routinely collected in hospital settings. Unfortunately, the prediction of key cardiac biomarkers from PPG instead of APW remains an open challenge, further complicated by the scarcity of annotated PPG measurements. As a solution, we propose a hybrid approach that uses hemodynamic simulations and unlabeled clinical data to estimate cardiovascular biomarkers directly from PPG signals. Our hybrid model combines a conditional variational autoencoder trained on paired PPG-APW data with a conditional density estimator of cardiac biomarkers trained on labeled simulated APW segments. As a key result, our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach can detect fluctuations of cardiac output and stroke volume and outperform a supervised baseline in monitoring temporal changes in these biomarkers.",

        "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) is a new paradigm for training machine learning (ML) models without sharing data. While applying FL in cross-silo scenarios, where organizations collaborate, it is necessary that the FL system is reliable; however, participants can fail due to various reasons (e.g., communication issues or misconfigurations). In order to provide a reliable system, it is necessary to analyze the impact of participant failures. While this problem received attention in cross-device FL where mobile devices with limited resources participate, there is comparatively little research in cross-silo FL. Therefore, we conduct an extensive study for analyzing the impact of participant failures on the model quality in the context of inter-organizational cross-silo FL with few participants. In our study, we focus on analyzing generally influential factors such as the impact of the timing and the data as well as the impact on the evaluation, which is important for deciding, if the model should be deployed. We show that under high skews the evaluation is optimistic and hides the real impact. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the timing impacts the quality of the trained model. Our results offer insights for researchers and software architects aiming to build robust FL systems.",

To bridge this gap, we develop nnterp, a lightweight wrapper around NNsight that provides a unified interface for transformer analysis while preserving original HuggingFace implementations. Through automatic module renaming and comprehensive validation testing, nnterp enables researchers to write intervention code once and deploy it across 50+ model variants spanning 16 architecture families. The library includes built-in implementations of common interpretability methods (logit lens, patchscope, activation steering) and provides direct access to attention probabilities for models that support it. By packaging validation tests with the library, researchers can verify compatibility with custom models locally. nnterp bridges the gap between correctness and usability in mechanistic interpretability tooling.",

The paper then presents four detailed, state-of-the-art use case applications specifically within electrical engineering.

However, the inherent temporal heterogeneous induced by localized perturbations present significant challenges for generating structurally consistent time series. While flow matching provides a promising paradigm by modeling temporal dynamics through trajectory-level supervision, it fails to adequately capture abrupt transitions in perturbed time series, as the use of globally shared parameters constrains the velocity field to a unified representation. To address these limitations, we introduce \\textbf{PAFM}, a \\textbf{P}erturbation-\\textbf{A}ware \\textbf{F}low \\textbf{M}atching framework that models perturbed trajectories to ensure stable and structurally consistent time series generation. The framework incorporates perturbation-guided training to simulate localized disturbances and leverages a dual-path velocity field to capture trajectory deviations under perturbation, enabling refined modeling of perturbed behavior to enhance the structural coherence. In order to further improve sensitivity to trajectory perturbations while enhancing expressiveness, a mixture-of-experts decoder with flow routing dynamically allocates modeling capacity in response to different trajectory dynamics. Extensive experiments on both unconditional and conditional generation tasks demonstrate that PAFM consistently outperforms strong baselines. Code is available at this https URL.",

This heterogeneous structure presents significant challenges for existing diffusion-based imputation models, which typically assume a homogeneous feature space and rely on stochastic denoising trajectories. Such assumptions make it difficult to maintain conditional consistency, and they often lead to information collapse for categorical variables or instability when numerical variables require deterministic updates. These limitations indicate that a single diffusion process is insufficient for mixed-type tabular imputation. We propose a hybrid deterministic diffusion framework that separates heterogeneous features into two complementary generative channels. A continuous DDIM-based channel provides efficient and stable deterministic denoising for numerical variables, while a discrete latent-path diffusion channel, inspired by loopholing-based discrete diffusion, models categorical and discrete features without leaving their valid sample manifolds. The two channels are trained under a unified conditional imputation objective, enabling coherent reconstruction of mixed-type incomplete data. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets show that the proposed framework achieves higher imputation accuracy, more stable sampling trajectories, and improved robustness across MCAR, MAR, and MNAR settings compared with existing diffusion-based and classical methods. These results demonstrate the importance of structure-aware diffusion processes for advancing deep learning approaches to incomplete tabular data.",

We present DecNefLab, a modular and interpretable simulation framework that formalizes DecNef as a machine learning problem. Beyond providing a virtual laboratory, DecNefLab enables researchers to model, analyze and understand neurofeedback dynamics. Using latent variable generative models as simulated participants, DecNefLab allows direct observation of internal cognitive states and systematic evaluation of how different protocol designs and subject characteristics influence learning. We demonstrate how this approach can (i) reproduce empirical phenomena of DecNef learning, (ii) identify conditions under which DecNef feedback fails to induce learning, and (iii) guide the design of more robust and reliable DecNef protocols in silico before human implementation. In summary, DecNefLab bridges computational modeling and cognitive neuroscience, offering a principled foundation for methodological innovation, robust protocol design, and ultimately, a deeper understanding of DecNef-based brain modulation.",

Here, we propose Apo2Mol, a diffusion-based generative framework for 3D molecule design that explicitly accounts for conformational flexibility in protein binding pockets. To support this, we curate a dataset of over 24,000 experimentally resolved apo-holo structure pairs from the Protein Data Bank, enabling the characterization of protein structure changes associated with ligand binding. Apo2Mol employs a full-atom hierarchical graph-based diffusion model that simultaneously generates 3D ligand molecules and their corresponding holo pocket conformations from input apo states. Empirical studies demonstrate that Apo2Mol can achieve state-of-the-art performance in generating high-affinity ligands and accurately capture realistic protein pocket conformational changes.",

        "abstract": "Robots can adapt to user preferences by learning reward functions from demonstrations, but with limited data, reward models often overfit to spurious correlations and fail to generalize. This happens because demonstrations show robots how to do a task but not what matters for that task, causing the model to focus on irrelevant state details. Natural language can more directly specify what the robot should focus on, and, in principle, disambiguate between many reward functions consistent with the demonstrations. However, existing language-conditioned reward learning methods typically treat instructions as simple conditioning signals, without fully exploiting their potential to resolve ambiguity. Moreover, real instructions are often ambiguous themselves, so naive conditioning is unreliable. Our key insight is that these two input types carry complementary information: demonstrations show how to act, while language specifies what is important. We propose Masked Inverse Reinforcement Learning (Masked IRL), a framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to combine the strengths of both input types. Masked IRL infers state-relevance masks from language instructions and enforces invariance to irrelevant state components. When instructions are ambiguous, it uses LLM reasoning to clarify them in the context of the demonstrations. In simulation and on a real robot, Masked IRL outperforms prior language-conditioned IRL methods by up to 15% while using up to 4.7 times less data, demonstrating improved sample-efficiency, generalization, and robustness to ambiguous language.

While recent approaches have explored episodic memory (Reflexion), gradient-based prompt optimization (TextGrad),and hierarchical task decomposition independently, their potential for synergistic integration remains unexplored. We introduce ReflexGrad, a novel architecture that tightly couples three complementary mechanisms: (1) LLM-based hierarchical TODO decomposition for strategic planning, (2) history-aware causal reflection that analyzes recent action patterns to identify failure root causes and enable within-trial learning, and (3) gradient-based optimization for systematic improvement. Unlike prior work relying on few-shot demonstrations, our system achieves true zero-shot generalization through pure LLM semantic reasoning,requiring no task-specific examples, fine-tuning, or hardcoded similarity metrics. Evaluated on ALFWorld benchmark tasks, ReflexGrad demonstrates 67% zero-shot success rate on Trial 0 without any prior task experience or demonstrations, establishing effective performance on first exposure.

While AI and human biases have been studied extensively in isolation, this paper examines their complex interaction. Specifically, we examined how class imbalance as an AI bias affects people's ability to appropriately rely on an AI-based decision-support system, and how it interacts with base rate neglect as a human bias. In a within-subject online study (N= 46), participants classified three diseases using an AI-based decision-support system trained on either a balanced or unbalanced dataset. We found that class imbalance disrupted participants' calibration of AI reliance. Moreover, we observed mutually reinforcing effects between class imbalance and base rate neglect, offering evidence of a compound human-AI bias. Based on these findings, we advocate for an interactionist perspective and further research into the mutually reinforcing effects of biases in human-AI interaction.",

This issue arises from the lack of comprehensive benchmarks that assess both external environmental risks and in-cabin driving behavior safety simultaneously. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce DSBench, the first comprehensive Driving Safety Benchmark designed to assess a VLM's awareness of various safety risks in a unified manner. DSBench encompasses two major categories: external environmental risks and in-cabin driving behavior safety, divided into 10 key categories and a total of 28 sub-categories. This comprehensive evaluation covers a wide range of scenarios, ensuring a thorough assessment of VLMs' performance in safety-critical contexts. Extensive evaluations across various mainstream open-source and closed-source VLMs reveal significant performance degradation under complex safety-critical situations, highlighting urgent safety concerns. To address this, we constructed a large dataset of 98K instances focused on in-cabin and external safety scenarios, showing that fine-tuning on this dataset significantly enhances the safety performance of existing VLMs and paves the way for advancing autonomous driving technology. The benchmark toolkit, code, and model checkpoints will be publicly accessible.",

While tabular predictors provide robust markers of global risk, their ability to capture subtle brain changes remains limited. In this study, we evaluate the predictive contributions of tabular and imaging-based representations, with a focus on transformer-derived Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) embeddings. We introduce a trajectory-aware labeling strategy based on Dynamic Time Warping clustering to capture heterogeneous patterns of cognitive change, and train a 3D Vision Transformer (ViT) via unsupervised reconstruction on harmonized and augmented MRI data to obtain anatomy-preserving embeddings without progression labels. The pretrained encoder embeddings are subsequently assessed using both traditional machine learning classifiers and deep learning heads, and compared against tabular representations and convolutional network baselines. Results highlight complementary strengths across modalities. Clinical and volumetric features achieved the highest AUCs of around 0.70 for predicting mild and severe progression, underscoring their utility in capturing global decline trajectories. In contrast, MRI embeddings from the ViT model were most effective in distinguishing cognitively stable individuals with an AUC of 0.71. However, all approaches struggled in the heterogeneous moderate group. These findings indicate that clinical features excel in identifying high-risk extremes, whereas transformer-based MRI embeddings are more sensitive to subtle markers of stability, motivating multimodal fusion strategies for AD progression modeling.",

Post-AKI clinical states were identified by clustering patient vectors derived from longitudinal medical codes and creatinine measurements. Transition probabilities between states and progression to CKD were estimated using multi-state modeling. After identifying common post-AKI trajectories, CKD risk factors in AKI subpopulations were identified through survival analysis. Of 20,699 patients with AKI at admission, 3,491 (17%) developed CKD. We identified fifteen distinct post-AKI states, each with different probabilities of CKD development. Most patients (75%, n=15,607) remained in a single state or made only one transition during the study period. Both established (e.g., AKI severity, diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, liver disease) and novel CKD risk factors, with their impact varying across these clinical states.

        "abstract": "In multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF), accurately modeling the intricate dependencies among multiple variables remains a significant challenge due to the inherent limitations of traditional approaches. Most existing models adopt either \\textbf{channel-independent} (CI) or \\textbf{channel-dependent} (CD) strategies, each presenting distinct drawbacks. CI methods fail to leverage the potential insights from inter-channel interactions, resulting in models that may not fully exploit the underlying statistical dependencies present in the data. Conversely, CD approaches often incorporate too much extraneous information, risking model overfitting and predictive inefficiency. To address these issues, we introduce the Adaptive Forecasting Transformer (\\textbf{Adapformer}), an advanced Transformer-based framework that merges the benefits of CI and CD methodologies through effective channel management. The core of Adapformer lies in its dual-stage encoder-decoder architecture, which includes the \\textbf{A}daptive \\textbf{C}hannel \\textbf{E}nhancer (\\textbf{ACE}) for enriching embedding processes and the \\textbf{A}daptive \\textbf{C}hannel \\textbf{F}orecaster (\\textbf{ACF}) for refining the predictions. ACE enhances token representations by selectively incorporating essential dependencies, while ACF streamlines the decoding process by focusing on the most relevant covariates, substantially reducing noise and redundancy. Our rigorous testing on diverse datasets shows that Adapformer achieves superior performance over existing models, enhancing both predictive accuracy and computational efficiency, thus making it state-of-the-art in MTSF.",

Using these reward signals, we construct preference datasets and adapt NORA-1.5 to target embodiments through direct preference optimization (DPO). Extensive evaluations show that reward-driven post-training consistently improves performance in both simulation and real-robot settings, demonstrating significant VLA model-reliability gains through simple yet effective reward models.

        "abstract": "Attention is the brain's ability to selectively focus on a few specific aspects while ignoring irrelevant ones. This biological principle inspired the attention mechanism in modern Transformers. Transformers now underpin large language models (LLMs) such as GPT, but at the cost of massive training and inference energy, leading to a large carbon footprint. While brain attention emerges from neural circuits, Transformer attention relies on dot-product similarity to weight elements in the input sequence. Neuromorphic computing, especially spiking neural networks (SNNs), offers a brain-inspired path to energy-efficient intelligence. Despite recent work on attention-based spiking Transformers, the core attention layer remains non-neuromorphic. Current spiking attention (i) relies on dot-product or element-wise similarity suited to floating-point operations, not event-driven spikes; (ii) keeps attention matrices that suffer from the von Neumann bottleneck, limiting in-memory computing; and (iii) still diverges from brain-like computation. To address these issues, we propose the Spiking STDP Transformer (S$^{2}$TDPT), a neuromorphic Transformer that implements self-attention through spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), embedding query--key correlations in synaptic weights. STDP, a core mechanism of memory and learning in the brain and widely studied in neuromorphic devices, naturally enables in-memory computing and supports non-von Neumann hardware. On CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, our model achieves 94.35\\% and 78.08\\% accuracy with only four timesteps and 0.49 mJ on CIFAR-100, an 88.47\\% energy reduction compared to a standard ANN Transformer. Grad-CAM shows that the model attends to semantically relevant regions, enhancing interpretability. Overall, S$^{2}$TDPT illustrates how biologically inspired attention can yield energy-efficient, hardware-friendly, and explainable neuromorphic models.",

These constraints force the use of heuristics such as fixed-window truncation or sliding windows, which compromise fidelity on ultra-long sequences by discarding distant information. We introduce FOCUS (Feature-Oriented Compression for Ultra-long Self-attention), a progressive context-compression module that can be plugged into pretrained DNA LLMs. FOCUS combines the established k-mer representation in genomics with learnable hierarchical compression: it inserts summary tokens at k-mer granularity and progressively compresses attention key and value activations across multiple Transformer layers, retaining only the summary KV states across windows while discarding ordinary-token KV. A shared-boundary windowing scheme yields a stationary cross-window interface that propagates long-range information with minimal loss. We validate FOCUS on an Evo-2-based DNA LLM fine-tuned on GRCh38 chromosome 1 with self-supervised training and randomized compression schedules to promote robustness across compression ratios. On held-out human chromosomes, FOCUS achieves near-lossless fidelity: compressing a 1 kb context into only 10 summary tokens (about 100x) shifts the average per-nucleotide probability by only about 0.0004. Compared to a baseline without compression, FOCUS reduces KV-cache memory and converts effective inference scaling from O(N^2) to near-linear O(N), enabling about 100x longer inference windows on commodity GPUs with near-lossless fidelity.",

        "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training while preserving data privacy. However, it remains vulnerable to malicious clients who compromise model integrity through Byzantine attacks, data poisoning, or adaptive adversarial behaviors. Existing defense mechanisms rely on static thresholds and binary classification, failing to adapt to evolving client behaviors in real-world deployments. We propose FLARE, an adaptive reputation-based framework that transforms client reliability assessment from binary decisions to a continuous, multi-dimensional trust evaluation. FLARE integrates: (i) a multi-dimensional reputation score capturing performance consistency, statistical anomaly indicators, and temporal behavior, (ii) a self-calibrating adaptive threshold mechanism that adjusts security strictness based on model convergence and recent attack intensity, (iii) reputation-weighted aggregation with soft exclusion to proportionally limit suspicious contributions rather than eliminating clients outright, and (iv) a Local Differential Privacy (LDP) mechanism enabling reputation scoring on privatized client updates. We further introduce a highly evasive Statistical Mimicry (SM) attack, a benchmark adversary that blends honest gradients with synthetic perturbations and persistent drift to remain undetected by traditional filters. Extensive experiments with 100 clients on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and SVHN demonstrate that FLARE maintains high model accuracy and converges faster than state-of-the-art Byzantine-robust methods under diverse attack types, including label flipping, gradient scaling, adaptive attacks, ALIE, and SM. FLARE improves robustness by up to 16% and preserves model convergence within 30% of the non-attacked baseline, while achieving strong malicious-client detection performance with minimal computational overhead. this https URL",

        "abstract": "We improve the complex number identity proving method to a fully automated procedure, based on elimination ideals. By using declarative equations or rewriting each real-relational hypothesis $h_i$ to $h_i-r_i$, and the thesis $t$ to $t-r$, clearing the denominators and introducing an extra expression with a slack variable, we eliminate all free and relational point variables. From the obtained ideal $I$ in $\\mathbb{Q}[r,r_1,r_2,\\ldots]$ we can find a conclusive result. It plays an important role that if $r_1,r_2,\\ldots$ are real, $r$ must also be real if there is a linear polynomial $p(r)\\in I$, unless division by zero occurs when expressing $r$. Our results are presented in Mathematica, Maple and in a new version of the Giac computer algebra system. Finally, we present a prototype of the automated procedure in an experimental version of the dynamic geometry software GeoGebra.",
