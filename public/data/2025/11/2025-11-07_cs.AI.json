        "abstract": "While reinforcement learning (RL) can empower large language model (LLM) agents by enabling self-improvement through interaction, its practical adoption remains challenging due to costly rollouts, limited task diversity, unreliable reward signals, and infrastructure complexity, all of which obstruct the collection of scalable experience data. To address these challenges, we introduce DreamGym, the first unified framework designed to synthesize diverse experiences with scalability in mind to enable effective online RL training for autonomous agents. Rather than relying on expensive real-environment rollouts, DreamGym distills environment dynamics into a reasoning-based experience model that derives consistent state transitions and feedback signals through step-by-step reasoning, enabling scalable agent rollout collection for RL. To improve the stability and quality of transitions, DreamGym leverages an experience replay buffer initialized with offline real-world data and continuously enriched with fresh interactions to actively support agent training. To improve knowledge acquisition, DreamGym adaptively generates new tasks that challenge the current agent policy, enabling more effective online curriculum learning. Experiments across diverse environments and agent backbones demonstrate that DreamGym substantially improves RL training, both in fully synthetic settings and in sim-to-real transfer scenarios. On non-RL-ready tasks like WebArena, DreamGym outperforms all baselines by over 30%. And in RL-ready but costly settings, it matches GRPO and PPO performance using only synthetic interactions. When transferring a policy trained purely on synthetic experiences to real-environment RL, DreamGym yields significant additional performance gains while requiring far fewer real-world interactions, providing a scalable warm-start strategy for general-purpose RL.",

        "abstract": "Tokenization is fundamental in assembly code analysis, impacting intrinsic characteristics like vocabulary size, semantic coverage, and extrinsic performance in downstream tasks. Despite its significance, tokenization in the context of assembly code remains an underexplored area. This study aims to address this gap by evaluating the intrinsic properties of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tokenization models and parameter choices, such as vocabulary size. We explore preprocessing customization options and pre-tokenization rules tailored to the unique characteristics of assembly code. Additionally, we assess their impact on downstream tasks like function signature prediction -- a critical problem in binary code analysis. To this end, we conduct a thorough study on various tokenization models, systematically analyzing their efficiency in encoding assembly instructions and capturing semantic nuances. Through intrinsic evaluations, we compare tokenizers based on tokenization efficiency, vocabulary compression, and representational fidelity for assembly code. Using state-of-the-art pre-trained models such as the decoder-only Large Language Model (LLM) Llama 3.2, the encoder-only transformer BERT, and the encoder-decoder model BART, we evaluate the effectiveness of these tokenizers across multiple performance metrics. Preliminary findings indicate that tokenizer choice significantly influences downstream performance, with intrinsic metrics providing partial but incomplete predictability of extrinsic evaluation outcomes. These results reveal complex trade-offs between intrinsic tokenizer properties and their utility in practical assembly code tasks. Ultimately, this study provides valuable insights into optimizing tokenization models for low-level code analysis, contributing to the robustness and scalability of Natural Language Model (NLM)-based binary analysis workflows.",

        "abstract": "A longstanding goal in computational educational research is to develop explainable knowledge tracing (KT) models. Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT), which leverages a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict student knowledge and performance on exercises, has been proposed as a major advancement over traditional KT methods. Several studies suggest that its performance gains stem from its ability to model bidirectional relationships between different knowledge components (KCs) within a course, enabling the inference of a student's understanding of one KC from their performance on others. In this paper, we challenge this prevailing explanation and demonstrate that DKT's strength lies in its implicit ability to model prerequisite relationships as a causal structure, rather than bidirectional relationships. By pruning exercise relation graphs into Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and training DKT on causal subsets of the Assistments dataset, we show that DKT's predictive capabilities align strongly with these causal structures. Furthermore, we propose an alternative method for extracting exercise relation DAGs using DKT's learned representations and provide empirical evidence supporting our claim. Our findings suggest that DKT's effectiveness is largely driven by its capacity to approximate causal dependencies between KCs rather than simple relational mappings.",

At the same time, there are well-documented imbalances in the training data and optimisation objectives of this technology, raising doubts as to whether LLMs can represent the cultural diversity of their broad user base. In this study, we look at LLMs and cultural values and examine how prompt language and cultural framing influence model responses and their alignment with human values in different countries. We probe 10 LLMs with 63 items from the Hofstede Values Survey Module and World Values Survey, translated into 11 languages, and formulated as prompts with and without different explicit cultural perspectives. Our study confirms that both prompt language and cultural perspective produce variation in LLM outputs, but with an important caveat: While targeted prompting can, to a certain extent, steer LLM responses in the direction of the predominant values of the corresponding countries, it does not overcome the models' systematic bias toward the values associated with a restricted set of countries in our dataset: the Netherlands, Germany, the US, and Japan. All tested models, regardless of their origin, exhibit remarkably similar patterns: They produce fairly neutral responses on most topics, with selective progressive stances on issues such as social tolerance. Alignment with cultural values of human respondents is improved more with an explicit cultural perspective than with a targeted prompt language. Unexpectedly, combining both approaches is no more effective than cultural framing with an English prompt. These findings reveal that LLMs occupy an uncomfortable middle ground: They are responsive enough to changes in prompts to produce variation, but too firmly anchored to specific cultural defaults to adequately represent cultural diversity.",

ArchPilot consists of three specialized agents: an orchestration agent that coordinates the search process using a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-inspired novel algorithm with a restart mechanism and manages memory of previous candidates; a generation agent that iteratively generates, improves, and debugs candidate architectures; and an evaluation agent that executes proxy training runs, generates and optimizes proxy functions, and aggregates the proxy scores into a fidelity-aware performance metric. This multi-agent collaboration allows ArchPilot to prioritize high-potential candidates with minimal reliance on expensive full training runs, facilitating efficient ML engineering under limited budgets. Experiments on MLE-Bench demonstrate that ArchPilot outperforms SOTA baselines such as AIDE and ML-Master, validating the effectiveness of our multi-agent system.",

We hypothesize that numerical attributes occupy shared latent subspaces and investigate two questions:(1) How do LLMs internally integrate multiple numerical attributes of a single entity? (2)How does irrelevant numerical context perturb these representations and their downstream outputs? To address these questions, we combine linear probing with partial correlation analysis and prompt-based vulnerability tests across models of varying sizes. Our results show that LLMs encode real-world numerical correlations but tend to systematically amplify them. Moreover, irrelevant context induces consistent shifts in magnitude representations, with downstream effects that vary by model size. These findings reveal a vulnerability in LLM decision-making and lay the groundwork for fairer, representation-aware control under multi-attribute entanglement.",

While existing computational methods primarily aim to generate large ensembles of legally valid districting plans, they often neglect the strategic dynamics involved in the selection process. This oversight creates opportunities for partisan actors to cherry-pick maps that, while technically compliant, are politically advantageous. Simply satisfying formal constraints does not ensure fairness when the selection process itself can be manipulated. We propose \\textbf{Agentmandering}, a framework that reimagines redistricting as a turn-based negotiation between two agents representing opposing political interests. Drawing inspiration from game-theoretic ideas, particularly the \\textit{Choose-and-Freeze} protocol, our method embeds strategic interaction into the redistricting process via large language model (LLM) agents. Agents alternate between selecting and freezing districts from a small set of candidate maps, gradually partitioning the state through constrained and interpretable choices. Evaluation on post-2020 U.S. Census data across all states shows that Agentmandering significantly reduces partisan bias and unfairness, while achieving 2 to 3 orders of magnitude lower variance than standard baselines. These results demonstrate both fairness and stability, especially in swing-state scenarios. Our code is available at this https URL.",

KGFR encodes relations using LLM-generated descriptions and initializes entities based on their roles in the question, enabling zero-shot generalization to unseen KGs. To handle large graphs efficiently, it employs Asymmetric Progressive Propagation (APP)- a stepwise expansion that selectively limits high-degree nodes while retaining informative paths.

Our methodology addresses the fundamental dual challenge of testing platforms: generating realistic test conversations (simulation quality) and accurately evaluating agent responses (evaluation quality). The framework combines established psychometric techniques (pairwise comparisons yielding Elo ratings, bootstrap confidence intervals, and permutation tests) with rigorous statistical validation to provide reproducible metrics applicable to any testing approach. To validate the framework and demonstrate its utility, we conducted comprehensive empirical evaluation of three leading commercial platforms focused on Voice AI Testing using 21,600 human judgments across 45 simulations and ground truth validation on 60 conversations. Results reveal statistically significant performance differences with the proposed framework, with the top-performing platform, Evalion, achieving 0.92 evaluation quality measured as f1-score versus 0.73 for others, and 0.61 simulation quality using a league based scoring system (including ties) vs 0.43 for other platforms. This framework enables researchers and organizations to empirically validate the testing capabilities of any platform, providing essential measurement foundations for confident voice AI deployment at scale. Supporting materials are made available to facilitate reproducibility and adoption.",

While multi-human settings like homes and hospitals are promising for AI assistance, prior work on empowerment-based assistance assumes that the agent assists one human in isolation. We introduce an open source multi-human gridworld test suite Disempower-Grid. Using Disempower-Grid, we empirically show that assistive RL agents optimizing for one human's empowerment can significantly reduce another human's environmental influence and rewards - a phenomenon we formalize as disempowerment. We characterize when disempowerment occurs in these environments and show that joint empowerment mitigates disempowerment at the cost of the user's reward. Our work reveals a broader challenge for the AI alignment community: goal-agnostic objectives that seem aligned in single-agent settings can become misaligned in multi-agent contexts.",

        "abstract": "Sharing and reconstructing a consistent spatial memory is a critical challenge in multi-agent systems, where partial observability and limited bandwidth often lead to catastrophic failures in coordination. We introduce a multi-agent predictive coding framework that formulate coordination as the minimization of mutual uncertainty among agents. Instantiated as an information bottleneck objective, it prompts agents to learn not only who and what to communicate but also when. At the foundation of this framework lies a grid-cell-like metric as internal spatial coding for self-localization, emerging spontaneously from self-supervised motion prediction. Building upon this internal spatial code, agents gradually develop a bandwidth-efficient communication mechanism and specialized neural populations that encode partners' locations: an artificial analogue of hippocampal social place cells (SPCs). These social representations are further enacted by a hierarchical reinforcement learning policy that actively explores to reduce joint uncertainty. On the Memory-Maze benchmark, our approach shows exceptional resilience to bandwidth constraints: success degrades gracefully from 73.5% to 64.4% as bandwidth shrinks from 128 to 4 bits/step, whereas a full-broadcast baseline collapses from 67.6% to 28.6%. Our findings establish a theoretically principled and biologically plausible basis for how complex social representations emerge from a unified predictive drive, leading to social collective intelligence.",

Our analysis reveals this is driven by policy over-specialization and catastrophic forgetting of diverse solutions generated during training. Standard optimization discards this valuable inter-step policy diversity. To address this, we introduce RLoop, a self-improving framework built on iterative policy initialization. RLoop transforms the standard training process into a virtuous cycle: it first uses RL to explore the solution space from a given policy, then filters the successful trajectories to create an expert dataset. This dataset is used via Rejection-sampling Fine-Tuning (RFT) to refine the initial policy, creating a superior starting point for the next iteration. This loop of exploration and exploitation via iterative re-initialization effectively converts transient policy variations into robust performance gains. Our experiments show RLoop mitigates forgetting and substantially improves generalization, boosting average accuracy by 9% and pass@32 by over 15% compared to vanilla RL.",

It is widely assumed that a high probe accuracy indicates a CAV faithfully representing its target concept. However, we show that the probe's classification accuracy alone is an unreliable measure of concept alignment, i.e., the degree to which a CAV captures the intended concept. In fact, we argue that probes are more likely to capture spurious correlations than they are to represent only the intended concept. As part of our analysis, we demonstrate that deliberately misaligned probes constructed to exploit spurious correlations, achieve an accuracy close to that of standard probes. To address this severe problem, we introduce a novel concept localization method based on spatial linear attribution, and provide a comprehensive comparison of it to existing feature visualization techniques for detecting and mitigating concept misalignment. We further propose three classes of metrics for quantitatively assessing concept alignment: hard accuracy, segmentation scores, and augmentation robustness. Our analysis shows that probes with translation invariance and spatial alignment consistently increase concept alignment. These findings highlight the need for alignment-based evaluation metrics rather than probe accuracy, and the importance of tailoring probes to both the model architecture and the nature of the target concept.",

However, research on their medication safety remains limited due to the lack of real world datasets, constrained by privacy and accessibility issues. Moreover, evaluation of LLMs in realistic clinical consultation settings, particularly regarding medication safety, is still underexplored. To address these gaps, we propose a framework that simulates and evaluates clinical consultations to systematically assess the medication safety capabilities of LLMs. Within this framework, we generate inquiry diagnosis dialogues with embedded medication risks and construct a dedicated medication safety database, RxRisk DB, containing 6,725 contraindications, 28,781 drug interactions, and 14,906 indication-drug pairs. A two-stage filtering strategy ensures clinical realism and professional quality, resulting in the benchmark RxSafeBench with 2,443 high-quality consultation scenarios. We evaluate leading open-source and proprietary LLMs using structured multiple choice questions that test their ability to recommend safe medications under simulated patient contexts. Results show that current LLMs struggle to integrate contraindication and interaction knowledge, especially when risks are implied rather than explicit. Our findings highlight key challenges in ensuring medication safety in LLM-based systems and provide insights into improving reliability through better prompting and task-specific tuning. RxSafeBench offers the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating medication safety in LLMs, advancing safer and more trustworthy AI-driven clinical decision support.",

MGV extends the Generate-Verify paradigm by adding explicit monitoring that captures metacognitive experiences (from difficulty assessments to confidence judgements) before generation begins and refines future monitoring through verification feedback.

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as \"agents\" for decision-making (DM) in interactive and dynamic environments. Yet, since they were not originally designed for DM, recent studies show that LLMs can struggle even in basic online DM problems, failing to achieve low regret or an effective exploration-exploitation tradeoff. To address this, we introduce Iterative Regret-Minimization Fine-Tuning (Iterative RMFT), a post-training procedure that repeatedly distills low-regret decision trajectories back into the base model. At each iteration, the model rolls out multiple decision trajectories, selects the k-lowest regret ones, and fine-tunes itself on them. Unlike prior methods that (a) distill action sequences from known DM algorithms or (b) rely on manually crafted chain-of-thought templates, our approach leverages the regret metric to elicit the model's own DM ability and reasoning rationales. This reliance on model-generated reasoning avoids rigid output engineering and provides more flexible, natural-language training signals. Empirical results show that Iterative RMFT improves LLMs' DM performance across diverse models - from Transformers with numerical input/output, to open-weight LLMs, and advanced closed-weight models like GPT-4o mini. Its flexibility in output and reasoning formats enables generalization across tasks with varying horizons, action spaces, reward processes, and natural-language contexts. Finally, we provide theoretical insight showing that a single-layer Transformer under this paradigm can act as a no-regret learner in a simplified setting. Overall, Iterative RMFT offers a principled and general post-training framework for enhancing LLMs' decision-making capabilities.",

But this simplicity also makes it ill-specified as we seek to enhance RL training with richer, non-binary feedback. When using ordinal rewards to give partial credit, GRPO's simplicity starts to hurt, as its group-average baseline often assigns a positive advantage to failed trajectories and reinforces incorrect behavior. We introduce Correctness Relative Policy Optimization (CoRPO), a new formulation that solves this flaw. CoRPO uses an adaptive baseline that enforces a minimum quality threshold, ensuring failed solutions are never positively reinforced. Once the policy consistently meets this threshold, the baseline automatically transitions to a relative preference mode, pushing the model to find optimal solutions rather than just \"acceptable\" ones. We empirically validate CoRPO on a code verification task, where it demonstrates more stable convergence and better out-of-domain generalization. This work represents a critical step in our broader research program to enable LLMs to learn genuinely new capabilities through reinforcement learning. We achieve this by enabling LLMs to learn from rich, multi-dimensional feedback - progressing from binary to ordinal rewards in this work, and onward to denser, per-step supervision.",

However, they lack the capability to interpret and integrate the complex, semantic, and dynamic contexts of human drivers, such as multi-step tasks, situational constraints, or urgent needs. This paper introduces and evaluates PAVe (Personalized Agentic Vehicular Routing), a hybrid agentic assistant designed to augment classical pathfinding algorithms with contextual reasoning. Our approach employs a Large Language Model (LLM) agent that operates on a candidate set of routes generated by a multi-objective (time, CO2) Dijkstra algorithm. The agent evaluates these options against user-provided tasks, preferences, and avoidance rules by leveraging a pre-processed geospatial cache of urban Points of Interest (POIs). In a benchmark of realistic urban scenarios, PAVe successfully used complex user intent into appropriate route modifications, achieving over 88% accuracy in its initial route selections with a local model. We conclude that combining classical routing algorithms with an LLM-based semantic reasoning layer is a robust and effective approach for creating personalized, adaptive, and scalable solutions for urban mobility optimization.",

They can autonomously interact with the internet at the user's behest, such as navigating websites, filling search masks, and comparing price lists. Though web agent research is thriving, induced sustainability issues remain largely unexplored. To highlight the urgency of this issue, we provide an initial exploration of the energy and $CO_2$ cost associated with web agents from both a theoretical -via estimation- and an empirical perspective -by benchmarking. Our results show how different philosophies in web agent creation can severely impact the associated expended energy, and that more energy consumed does not necessarily equate to better results. We highlight a lack of transparency regarding disclosing model parameters and processes used for some web agents as a limiting factor when estimating energy consumption. Our work contributes towards a change in thinking of how we evaluate web agents, advocating for dedicated metrics measuring energy consumption in benchmarks.",

Yet how closely LLMs mirror actual human decision-making remains poorly understood. This gap is critical: misalignment could produce harmful outcomes in practical applications, while failure to replicate human behavior renders LLMs ineffective for social simulations. Here, we address this gap by developing a digital twin of game-theoretic experiments and introducing a systematic prompting and probing framework for machine-behavioral evaluation. Testing three open-source models (Llama, Mistral and Qwen), we find that Llama reproduces human cooperation patterns with high fidelity, capturing human deviations from rational choice theory, while Qwen aligns closely with Nash equilibrium predictions. Notably, we achieved population-level behavioral replication without persona-based prompting, simplifying the simulation process. Extending beyond the original human-tested games, we generate and preregister testable hypotheses for novel game configurations outside the original parameter grid. Our findings demonstrate that appropriately calibrated LLMs can replicate aggregate human behavioral patterns and enable systematic exploration of unexplored experimental spaces, offering a complementary approach to traditional research in the social and behavioral sciences that generates new empirical predictions about human social decision-making.",

        "abstract": "Urban surface water flooding, triggered by intense rainfall overwhelming drainage systems, is increasingly frequent and widespread. While flood prediction and monitoring in high spatial-temporal resolution are desired, practical constraints in time, budget, and technology hinder its full implementation. How to monitor urban drainage networks and predict flow conditions under constrained resource is a major challenge. This study presents a data-driven sparse sensing (DSS) framework, integrated with EPA-SWMM, to optimize sensor placement and reconstruct peak flowrates in a stormwater system, using the Woodland Avenue catchment in Duluth, Minnesota, as a case study. We utilized a SWMM model to generate a training dataset of peak flowrate profiles across the stormwater network. Furthermore, we applied DSS - leveraging singular value decomposition for dimensionality reduction and QR factorization for sensor allocation - to identify the optimal monitoring nodes based on the simulated training dataset. We then validated the representativeness of these identified monitoring nodes by comparing the DSS-reconstructed peak flowrate profiles with those obtained from SWMM. Three optimally placed sensors among 77 nodes achieved satisfactory reconstruction performance with Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) values of 0.92-0.95 (25th to 75th percentiles). In addition, the model showed good robustness to uncertainty in measurements. Its robustness to sensor failures is location-dependent and improves with the number of sensors deployed. The framework balances computational efficiency and physical interpretability, enabling high-accuracy flow reconstruction with minimal sensors. This DSS framework can be further integrated with predictive models to realize flood early warning and real-time control under limited sensing and monitoring resource.",

We develop a principled framework distinguishing cooperative queries, i.e., queries that yield a resolvable interpretation, from uncooperative queries that cannot be resolved. Applying the framework to evaluations for tabular question answering and analysis, we analyze the queries in 15 popular datasets, and observe an uncontrolled mixing of query types neither adequate for evaluating a system's execution accuracy nor for evaluating interpretation capabilities. Our framework and analysis of queries shifts the perspective from fixing ambiguity to embracing cooperation in resolving queries. This reflection enables more informed design and evaluation for natural language interfaces for tabular data, for which we outline implications and directions for future research.",

While participants are typically invited to propose questions for expert panels, only a limited number can be selected due to time constraints. This raises the challenge of how to choose a small set of questions that best represent the interests of all participants. We introduce an auditing framework for measuring the level of representation provided by a slate of questions, based on the social choice concept known as justified representation (JR). We present the first algorithms for auditing JR in the general utility setting, with our most efficient algorithm achieving a runtime of $O(mn\\log n)$, where $n$ is the number of participants and $m$ is the number of proposed questions. We apply our auditing methods to historical deliberations, comparing the representativeness of (a) the actual questions posed to the expert panel (chosen by a moderator), (b) participants' questions chosen via integer linear programming, (c) summary questions generated by large language models (LLMs). Our results highlight both the promise and current limitations of LLMs in supporting deliberative processes. By integrating our methods into an online deliberation platform that has been used for over hundreds of deliberations across more than 50 countries, we make it easy for practitioners to audit and improve representation in future deliberations.",

        "abstract": "Cooperative multi-agent planning requires agents to make joint decisions with partial information and limited communication. Coordination at the trajectory level often fails, as small deviations in timing or movement cascade into conflicts. Symbolic planning mitigates this challenge by raising the level of abstraction and providing a minimal vocabulary of actions that enable synchronization and collective progress. We present DR. WELL, a decentralized neurosymbolic framework for cooperative multi-agent planning. Cooperation unfolds through a two-phase negotiation protocol: agents first propose candidate roles with reasoning and then commit to a joint allocation under consensus and environment constraints. After commitment, each agent independently generates and executes a symbolic plan for its role without revealing detailed trajectories. Plans are grounded in execution outcomes via a shared world model that encodes the current state and is updated as agents act. By reasoning over symbolic plans rather than raw trajectories, DR. WELL avoids brittle step-level alignment and enables higher-level operations that are reusable, synchronizable, and interpretable. Experiments on cooperative block-push tasks show that agents adapt across episodes, with the dynamic world model capturing reusable patterns and improving task completion rates and efficiency. Experiments on cooperative block-push tasks show that our dynamic world model improves task completion and efficiency through negotiation and self-refinement, trading a time overhead for evolving, more efficient collaboration strategies.",

Even when they reach correct answers, the underlying reasoning may be flawed, undermining trust in high-stakes scenarios. To mitigate this issue, we introduce VeriCoT, a neuro-symbolic method that extracts and verifies formal logical arguments from CoT reasoning. VeriCoT formalizes each CoT reasoning step into first-order logic and identifies premises that ground the argument in source context, commonsense knowledge, or prior reasoning steps. The symbolic representation enables automated solvers to verify logical validity while the NL premises allow humans and systems to identify ungrounded or fallacious reasoning steps. Experiments on the ProofWriter, LegalBench, and BioASQ datasets show VeriCoT effectively identifies flawed reasoning, and serves as a strong predictor of final answer correctness. We also leverage VeriCoT's verification signal for (1) inference-time self-reflection, (2) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on VeriCoT-distilled datasets and (3) preference fine-tuning (PFT) with direct preference optimization (DPO) using verification-based pairwise rewards, further improving reasoning validity and accuracy.",

While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential, general-purpose models have struggled to reliably apply complex, authentic classroom observation instruments. This paper uses custom LLMs built on sentence-level embeddings, an architecture better suited for the long-form, interpretive nature of classroom transcripts than conventional subword tokenization. We systematically evaluate five different sentence embeddings under a data-efficient training regime designed to prevent overfitting. Our results demonstrate that these specialized models can achieve human-level and even super-human performance with expert human ratings above 0.65 and surpassing the average human-human rater correlation. Further, through analysis of annotation context windows, we find that more advanced models-those better aligned with human judgments-attribute a larger share of score variation to lesson-level features rather than isolated utterances, challenging the sufficiency of single-turn annotation paradigms. Finally, to assess external validity, we find that aggregate model scores align with teacher value-added measures, indicating they are capturing features relevant to student learning. However, this trend does not hold at the individual item level, suggesting that while the models learn useful signals, they have not yet achieved full generalization. This work establishes a viable and powerful new methodology for AI-driven instructional measurement, offering a path toward providing scalable, reliable, and valid feedback for educator development.",

        "abstract": "On-device AI agents offer the potential for personalized, low-latency assistance, but their deployment is fundamentally constrained by limited memory capacity, which restricts usable context. This reduced practical context window creates a trade-off between supporting rich, stateful interactions with complex tool capabilities and maintaining on-device feasibility. We break this trade-off with a framework for context-efficient on-device agents, driven by three synergistic optimizations (1) a dynamic memory system using specialized LoRA adapters to distill conversational history into a compressed, and structured Context State Object; (2) a minimalist serialization format for tool schemas to minimize token overhead per tool; and (3) a just-in-time schema-passing mechanism that loads full tool definitions only upon tool selection. We instantiate this framework by adapting a 3B parameter SLM to context-efficient trajectories and rigorously evaluate it against a conventional baseline on complex user tasks. Our agent matches, or exceeds, the performance of a conventional baseline while dramatically compressing context, achieving more than a 6-fold reduction in initial system prompt context and a 10- to 25-fold reduction in context growth rate based on the interaction verbosity, demonstrating that strategic context management is key to unlocking capable and persistent on-device AI.",

It outlines evaluation metrics that extend beyond accuracy to trust, engagement, and longitudinal outcomes. It also analyzes risks including over-reliance, hallucination, bias, privacy exposure, and unequal access, and proposes future directions spanning unified evaluation, hybrid human-AI models, memory architectures, cross-domain benchmarking, and governance.

There are many ways in which researchers have attempted to evaluate the quality of these XAI models, such as user studies or proposed objective metrics like \"fidelity\". However, these current XAI evaluation techniques are ad hoc at best and not generalizable. Thus, most studies done within this field conduct simple user surveys to analyze the difference between no explanations and those generated by their proposed solution. We do not find this to provide adequate evidence that the explanations generated are of good quality since we believe any kind of explanation will be \"better\" in most metrics when compared to none at all. Thus, our study looks to highlight this pitfall: most explanations, regardless of quality or correctness, will increase user satisfaction. We also propose that emphasis should be placed on actionable explanations. We demonstrate the validity of both of our claims using an agent assistant to teach chess concepts to users. The results of this chapter will act as a call to action in the field of XAI for more comprehensive evaluation techniques for future research in order to prove explanation quality beyond user satisfaction. Additionally, we present an analysis of the scenarios in which placebic or actionable explanations would be most useful.",

During an 8-week period, networked groups of approximately 24 sports fans were tasked with collaboratively forecasting the winners of 59 baseball games through real-time conversation facilitated by AI agents. The results showed that when debating the games using Hyperchat AI technology, the groups converged on High Confidence predictions that significantly outperformed Vegas betting markets. Specifically, groups were 78% accurate in their High Confidence picks, a statistically strong result vs the Vegas odds of 57% (p=0.020). Had the groups bet against the spread (ATS) on these games, they would have achieved a 46% ROI against Vegas betting markets.

By transforming 1D ECG signals into 2D Gramian Angular Field (GAF) images, the proposed approach enables efficient feature extraction through Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) while ensuring that sensitive medical data remain local to each device. This work is among the first to experimentally validate GAF-based federated ECG classification across heterogeneous IoT devices, quantifying both performance and communication efficiency. To evaluate feasibility in realistic IoT settings, we deployed the framework across a server, a laptop, and a resource-constrained Raspberry Pi 4, reflecting edge-cloud integration in IoT ecosystems. Experimental results demonstrate that the FL-GAF model achieves a high classification accuracy of 95.18% in a multi-client setup, significantly outperforming a single-client baseline in both accuracy and training time. Despite the added computational complexity of GAF transformations, the framework maintains efficient resource utilization and communication overhead. These findings highlight the potential of lightweight, privacy-preserving AI for IoT-based healthcare monitoring, supporting scalable and secure edge deployments in smart health systems.",

Among the various forms of user interaction, comments play a vital role in fostering community participation and enabling content re-creation. However, generating comments that are both compliant with platform guidelines and capable of exhibiting stylistic diversity and contextual awareness remains a significant challenge. We introduce LOLGORITHM, a modular multi-agent system (MAS) designed for controllable short-video comment generation. The system integrates video segmentation, contextual and affective analysis, and style-aware prompt construction. It supports six distinct comment styles: puns (homophones), rhyming, meme application, sarcasm (irony), plain humor, and content extraction. Powered by a multimodal large language model (MLLM), LOLGORITHM directly processes video inputs and achieves fine-grained style control through explicit prompt markers and few-shot examples. To support development and evaluation, we construct a bilingual dataset using official APIs from Douyin (Chinese) and YouTube (English), covering five popular video genres: comedy skits, daily life jokes, funny animal clips, humorous commentary, and talk shows. Evaluation combines automated metrics originality, relevance, and style conformity with a large-scale human preference study involving 40 videos and 105 participants. Results show that LOLGORITHM significantly outperforms baseline models, achieving preference rates of over 90% on Douyin and 87.55% on YouTube.

To address the second threat, we offer to integrate transaction scheduling into the proposed framework. We implemented both of these ideas to develop the OptiMA framework and show that it is able to facilitate the execution of VCMAS with more than a hundred agents. We also demonstrate the effect of transaction scheduling on such a system by showing improvements up to more than 16\\%.

We present a hierarchy-preserving contrastive framework that makes the label tree a first-class training signal and an evaluation target. Our approach introduces two plug-in objectives: Hierarchy-Weighted Contrastive (HWC), which scales positive/negative pair strengths by shared ancestors to promote within-parent coherence, and Level-Aware Margin (LAM), a prototype margin that separates ancestor groups across levels. The formulation is geometry-agnostic and applies to Euclidean and hyperbolic embeddings without architectural changes. Across several benchmarks, including breast histopathology, the proposed objectives consistently improve representation quality over strong SSL baselines while better respecting the taxonomy. We evaluate with metrics tailored to hierarchy faithfulness: HF1 (hierarchical F1), H-Acc (tree-distance-weighted accuracy), and parent-distance violation rate. We also report top-1 accuracy for completeness. Ablations show that HWC and LAM are effective even without curvature, and combining them yields the most taxonomy-aligned representations. Taken together, these results provide a simple, general recipe for learning medical image representations that respect the label tree and advance both performance and interpretability in hierarchy-rich domains.",

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) show great promise as a powerful tool for scientific literature exploration. However, their effectiveness in providing scientifically accurate and comprehensive answers to complex questions within specialized domains remains an active area of research. Using the field of high-temperature cuprates as an exemplar, we evaluate the ability of LLM systems to understand the literature at the level of an expert. We construct an expert-curated database of 1,726 scientific papers that covers the history of the field, and a set of 67 expert-formulated questions that probe deep understanding of the literature. We then evaluate six different LLM-based systems for answering these questions, including both commercially available closed models and a custom retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system capable of retrieving images alongside text. Experts then evaluate the answers of these systems against a rubric that assesses balanced perspectives, factual comprehensiveness, succinctness, and evidentiary support. Among the six systems two using RAG on curated literature outperformed existing closed models across key metrics, particularly in providing comprehensive and well-supported answers. We discuss promising aspects of LLM performances as well as critical short-comings of all the models. The set of expert-formulated questions and the rubric will be valuable for assessing expert level performance of LLM based reasoning systems.",

We propose a routing approach that assigns each problem to the smallest model likely to solve it, reducing compute without sacrificing accuracy. Using intermediate representations from s1.1-32B, we train lightweight predictors of problem difficulty or model correctness to guide routing across a pool of reasoning models. On diverse math benchmarks, routing improves efficiency over random assignment and matches s1.1-32B's performance while using significantly less compute. Our results demonstrate that difficulty-aware routing is effective for cost-efficient deployment of reasoning models.",

Developed by a consortium of major Polish research institutions, PLLuM addresses the need for high-quality, transparent, and culturally relevant language models beyond the English-centric commercial landscape. We describe the development process, including the construction of a new 140-billion-token Polish text corpus for pre-training, a 77k custom instructions dataset, and a 100k preference optimization dataset. A key component is a Responsible AI framework that incorporates strict data governance and a hybrid module for output correction and safety filtering. We detail the models' architecture, training procedures, and alignment techniques for both base and instruction-tuned variants, and demonstrate their utility in a downstream task within public administration.

We propose a novel coarse-to-fine framework CORE for accurate nuclei-level registration across diverse multimodal whole-slide image (WSI) datasets. The coarse registration stage leverages prompt-based tissue mask extraction to effectively filter out artefacts and non-tissue regions, followed by global alignment using tissue morphology and ac- celerated dense feature matching with a pre-trained feature extractor. From the coarsely aligned slides, nuclei centroids are detected and subjected to fine-grained rigid registration using a custom, shape-aware point-set registration model. Finally, non-rigid alignment at the cellular level is achieved by estimating a non-linear dis- placement field using Coherent Point Drift (CPD). Our approach benefits from automatically generated nuclei that enhance the accuracy of deformable registra- tion and ensure precise nuclei-level correspondence across modalities. The pro- posed model is evaluated on three publicly available WSI registration datasets, and two private datasets. We show that CORE outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in terms of generalisability, precision, and robustness in bright-field and immunofluorescence microscopy WSIs",

The study explores how individuals experience and exercise levers of power, which are presented as social mechanisms that shape institutional responses to technological change. The study reports on the responses of personalized questionnaires designed to gather insight on a decision maker's institutional purview, based on an institutional governance framework developed from the work of Neo-institutionalists. Findings present the anonymized, real responses and circumstances of respondents in the form of twelve fictional personas of high-level decision makers from North America and Europe. These personas illustrate how personal agency, organizational logics, and institutional infrastructures may intersect in the governance of AI. The decision makers' responses to the questionnaires then inform a discussion of the field-level personal power of decision makers, methods of fostering institutional stability in times of change, and methods of influencing institutional change in the field of AI. The final section of the discussion presents a table of the dynamics of the levers of power in the field of AI for change makers and five testable hypotheses for institutional and social movement researchers. In summary, this study provides insight on the means for policymakers within institutions and their counterparts in civil society to personally engage with AI governance.",

While originally developed for natural language processing, LLMs have shown strong capabilities in modeling programming language syntax and semantics, outperforming traditional rule-based systems in both accuracy and flexibility. These models have streamlined cross-language conversion, reduced development overhead, and accelerated legacy code migration. In this paper, we introduce OMPILOT, a novel domain-specific encoder-decoder transformer tailored for translating C++ code into OpenMP, enabling effective shared-memory parallelization. OMPILOT leverages custom pre-training objectives that incorporate the semantics of parallel constructs and combines both unsupervised and supervised learning strategies to improve code translation robustness. Unlike previous work that focused primarily on loop-level transformations, OMPILOT operates at the function level to capture a wider semantic context. To evaluate our approach, we propose OMPBLEU, a novel composite metric specifically crafted to assess the correctness and quality of OpenMP parallel constructs, addressing limitations in conventional translation metrics.",

This paper introduces Class-Based Image Composition, an approach that allows us to reformulate training inputs through a fusion of multiple images of the same class into combined visual composites, named Composite Input Images (CoImg). That enhances the intra-class variance and improves the valuable information density per training sample and increases the ability of the model to distinguish between subtle disease patterns. Our method was evaluated on the Optical Coherence Tomography Dataset for Image-Based Deep Learning Methods (OCTDL) (Kulyabin et al., 2024), which contains 2,064 high-resolution optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans of the human retina, representing seven distinct diseases with a significant class imbalance. We constructed a perfectly class-balanced version of this dataset, named Co-OCTDL, where each scan is resented as a 3x1 layout composite image. To assess the effectiveness of this new representation, we conducted a comparative analysis between the original dataset and its variant using a VGG16 model. A fair comparison was ensured by utilizing the identical model architecture and hyperparameters for all experiments. The proposed approach markedly improved diagnostic this http URL enhanced Dataset achieved near-perfect accuracy (99.6%) with F1-score (0.995) and AUC (0.9996), compared to a baseline model trained on raw dataset. The false prediction rate was also significantly lower, this demonstrates that the method can producehigh-quality predictions even for weak datasets affected by class imbalance or small sample size.",

We evaluate secure code generation using the Instruct Prime, which eliminated compliance-required prompts and cue contamination, and evaluate five instruction-tuned code LLMs using a zero-shot baseline and a three-round reflexion prompting approach. Security is measured using the Insecure Code Detector (ICD), and results are reported by measuring Repair, Regression, and NetGain metrics, considering the programming language and CWE family. Our findings show that insecurity remains common at the first round: roughly 25-33% of programs are insecure at a zero-shot baseline (t0 ). Weak cryptography/config-dependent bugs are the hardest to avoid while templated ones like XSS, code injection, and hard-coded secrets are handled more reliably. Python yields the highest secure rates; C and C# are the lowest, with Java, JS, PHP, and C++ in the middle. Reflexion prompting improves security for all models, improving average accuracy from 70.74% at t0 to 79.43% at t3 , with the largest gains in the first round followed by diminishing returns. The trends with Repair, Regression, and NetGain metrics show that applying one to two rounds produces most of the benefits. A replication package is available at this https URL.",

Through conversations with nutritional experts and individuals who practice dietary tracking, we find current logging methods, such as handwritten and app-based journaling, are inflexible and result in low adherence and potentially inaccurate nutritional summaries. These findings, corroborated by prior literature, emphasize the urgent need for improved food logging methods. In response, we propose SnappyMeal, an AI-powered dietary tracking system that leverages multimodal inputs to enable users to more flexibly log their food intake. SnappyMeal introduces goal-dependent follow-up questions to intelligently seek missing context from the user and information retrieval from user grocery receipts and nutritional databases to improve accuracy.

        "abstract": "Deep generative models, especially diffusion architectures, have transformed image generation; however, they are challenging to control and optimize for specific goals without expensive retraining. Embedding Space Exploration, especially with Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), has been shown to be a promising method for optimizing image generation, particularly within Diffusion Models. Therefore, in this work, we study the performance of an evolutionary optimization method, namely Separable Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (sep-CMA-ES), against the widely adopted Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), applied to Stable Diffusion XL Turbo's prompt embedding vector. The evaluation of images combines the LAION Aesthetic Predictor V2 with CLIPScore into a weighted fitness function, allowing flexible trade-offs between visual appeal and adherence to prompts. Experiments on a subset of the Parti Prompts (P2) dataset showcase that sep-CMA-ES consistently yields superior improvements in aesthetic and alignment metrics in comparison to Adam. Results indicate that the evolutionary method provides efficient, gradient-free optimization for diffusion models, enhancing controllability without the need for fine-tuning. This study emphasizes the potential of evolutionary methods for embedding space exploration of deep generative models and outlines future research directions.",

Ruby, despite its widespread use in web development and the persistent challenges faced by its developers, has received little attention in APR research. In this paper, we introduce RAMP, a novel lightweight framework that formulates program repair as a feedback-driven, iterative process for Ruby. RAMP employs a team of collaborative agents that generate targeted tests, reflect on errors, and refine candidate fixes until a correct solution is found. Unlike prior approaches, RAMP is designed to avoid reliance on large multilingual repair databases or costly fine-tuning, instead operating directly on Ruby through lightweight prompting and test-driven feedback. Evaluation on the XCodeEval benchmark shows that RAMP achieves a pass@1 of 67% on Ruby, outper-forming prior approaches. RAMP converges quickly within five iterations, and ablation studies confirm that test generation and self-reflection are key drivers of its performance. Further analysis shows that RAMP is particularly effective at repairing wrong answers, compilation errors, and runtime errors. Our approach provides new insights into multi-agent repair strategies, and establishes a foundation for extending LLM-based debugging tools to under-studied languages.",

Bidirectional evaluation shows a 2.01:1 transfer asymmetry, indicating that general-purpose models yield more transferable representations than instruction-tuned variants. This conservative injection preserves computational stability while demonstrating that cross-model latent communication is feasible, enabling collaborative AI systems that share meaning rather than tokens.",

This poses persistent challenges to public health and vaccine development. While large-scale generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs) have revolutionized the modeling of sequential data, their direct applications to noisy viral genomic sequences are limited. In this paper, we introduce PETRA(Pretrained Evolutionary TRAnsformer), a novel transformer approach based on evolutionary trajectories derived from phylogenetic trees rather than raw RNA sequences. This method effectively mitigates sequencing noise and captures the hierarchical structure of viral evolution. With a weighted training framework to address substantial geographical and temporal imbalances in global sequence data, PETRA excels in predicting future SARS-CoV-2 mutations, achieving a weighted recall@1 of 9.45% for nucleotide mutations and 17.10\\% for spike amino-acid mutations, compared to 0.49% and 6.64% respectively for the best baseline. PETRA also demonstrates its ability to aid in the real-time mutation prediction of major clades like 24F(XEC) and 25A(LP.8.1). The code is open sourced on this https URL",

They become susceptible to concept drift and new threats such as zero-day or polymorphic attacks. To address this limitation, we propose a Ca$^{2+}$-modulated learning framework that draws inspiration from astrocytic Ca$^{2+}$ signaling in the brain, where rapid, context-sensitive adaptation enables robust information processing. Our approach couples a multicellular astrocyte dynamics simulator with a deep neural network (DNN). The simulator models astrocytic Ca$^{2+}$ dynamics through three key mechanisms: IP$_3$-mediated Ca$^{2+}$ release, SERCA pump uptake, and conductance-aware diffusion through gap junctions between cells. Evaluation of our proposed network on CTU-13 (Neris) network traffic data demonstrates the effectiveness of our biologically plausible approach. The Ca$^{2+}$-gated model outperforms a matched baseline DNN, achieving up to $\\sim$98\\% accuracy with reduced false positives and negatives across multiple train/test splits. Importantly, this improved performance comes with negligible runtime overhead once Ca$^{2+}$ trajectories are precomputed. While demonstrated here for cybersecurity applications, this Ca$^{2+}$-modulated learning framework offers a generic solution for streaming detection tasks that require rapid, biologically grounded adaptation to evolving data patterns.",

In this work, I present a hybrid fuzzing framework that integrates static and dynamic analysis with Large Language Model (LLM)-guided input mutation and semantic feedback. Static analysis extracts control-flow and data-flow information, which is transformed into structured prompts for the LLM to generate syntactically valid and semantically diverse inputs. During execution, I augment traditional coverage-based feedback with semantic feedback signals-derived from program state changes, exception types, and output semantics-allowing the fuzzer to prioritize inputs that trigger novel program behaviors beyond mere code coverage. I implement our approach atop AFL++, combining program instrumentation with embedding-based semantic similarity metrics to guide seed selection. Evaluation on real-world open-source targets, including libpng, tcpdump, and sqlite, demonstrates that our method achieves faster time-to-first-bug, higher semantic diversity, and a competitive number of unique bugs compared to state-of-the-art fuzzers.

While split computing offers a promising solution by partitioning model execution between edge devices and cloud servers, existing approaches fail to address the unique challenges of autoregressive inference, particularly the iterative token generation process and expanding key-value (KV) cache requirements. This work introduces the first autoregressive-aware split computing framework designed explicitly for LLM deployment on edge devices. Our approach makes three key contributions. First, we develop one-point split compression (OPSC), a mixed-precision quantization scheme that prevents out-of-memory failures by strategically partitioning models into front-end and back-end segments with different precision levels. Second, we propose a two-stage intermediate compression pipeline that combines threshold splitting (TS) and token-wise adaptive bit quantization (TAB-Q) to preserve accuracy-critical activations while dramatically reducing communication overhead. Third, we formulate a unified optimization framework that jointly selects optimal split points, quantization settings, and sequence lengths to satisfy strict memory and latency constraints. Extensive evaluations across diverse LLMs and hardware platforms demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art quantization methods, including SmoothQuant, OmniQuant, and Atom. The framework achieves a 1.49 inference speedup and significant communication overhead reduction while maintaining or improving model accuracy.",

The core human-machine collaboration bottleneck lies in the ``intention-to-action gap'', which is an error-prone process of translating a high-level rescue objective into a low-level swarm command under high intensity and pressure. To bridge this gap, this study proposes a novel LLM-CRF system that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to model and augment human-swarm teaming cognition. The proposed framework initially captures the operator's intention through natural and multi-modal interactions with the device via voice or graphical annotations. It then employs the LLM as a cognitive engine to perform intention comprehension, hierarchical task decomposition, and mission planning for the UAV swarm. This closed-loop framework enables the swarm to act as a proactive partner, providing active feedback in real-time while reducing the need for manual monitoring and control, which considerably advances the efficacy of the SAR task. We evaluate the proposed framework in a simulated SAR scenario. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to traditional order and command-based interfaces, the proposed LLM-driven approach reduced task completion time by approximately $64.2\\%$ and improved task success rate by $7\\%$. It also leads to a considerable reduction in subjective cognitive workload, with NASA-TLX scores dropping by $42.9\\%$. This work establishes the potential of LLMs to create more intuitive and effective human-swarm collaborations in high-stakes scenarios.",

We used the Regensburg Pediatric Appendicitis Dataset, which includes ultrasound scans, laboratory data, and clinical scores from pediatric patients admitted with abdominal pain to Children Hospital. Hedwig in Regensburg, Germany. Each subject had 1 to 15 ultrasound views covering the right lower quadrant, appendix, lymph nodes, and related structures. For the image based classification task, ResNet was fine tuned to distinguish appendicitis from non-appendicitis cases. Images were preprocessed by normalization, resizing, and augmentation to enhance generalization. The proposed ResNet model achieved an overall accuracy of 93.44, precision of 91.53, and recall of 89.8, demonstrating strong performance in identifying appendicitis across heterogeneous ultrasound views. The model effectively learned discriminative spatial features, overcoming challenges posed by low contrast, speckle noise, and anatomical variability in pediatric imaging.",

In this study, we applied the nnU-Net framework, an automated, self-configuring deep learning segmentation architecture, to the Left Atrial Segmentation Challenge 2013 dataset. The dataset consists of thirty MRI scans with corresponding expert-annotated masks. The nnU-Net model automatically adapted its preprocessing, network configuration, and training pipeline to the characteristics of the MRI data. Model performance was quantitatively evaluated using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), and qualitative results were compared against expert segmentations. The proposed nnU?Net model achieved a mean Dice score of 93.5, demonstrating high overlap with expert annotations and outperforming several traditional segmentation approaches reported in previous studies.

UGAD seeks to identify entire graphs that deviate from normal behavioral patterns. However, most Graph Neural Network (GNN) approaches implicitly assume that the training set is clean, containing only normal graphs, which is rarely true in practice. Even modest contamination by anomalous graphs can distort learned representations and sharply degrade performance. To address this challenge, we propose DeNoise, a robust UGAD framework explicitly designed for contaminated training data. It jointly optimizes a graph-level encoder, an attribute decoder, and a structure decoder via an adversarial objective to learn noise-resistant embeddings. Further, DeNoise introduces an encoder anchor-alignment denoising mechanism that fuses high-information node embeddings from normal graphs into all graph embeddings, improving representation quality while suppressing anomaly interference. A contrastive learning component then compacts normal graph embeddings and repels anomalous ones in the latent space. Extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets demonstrate that DeNoise consistently learns reliable graph-level representations under varying noise intensities and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art UGAD baselines.",

Addressing this critical gap, this paper conducts research to propose a novel automated theorem generation theory and tool. Based on the concept of standard contradiction which possesses unique deductive advantages, this paper defines and proves, for the first time, a new logical structure known as rectangular standard contradiction. Centered on this structure, a complete Automated Theorem Generation (ATG) theory is put forward. Theoretical proofs clarify two core properties of rectangular standard contradiction: first, it is a standard contradiction (necessarily unsatisfiable); second, it exhibits non-redundancy (the remaining clause set becomes satisfiable after removing any clause). Leveraging these properties, this paper proves that partitioning a rectangular standard contradiction into a premise subset $A$ and negation of its complement $H$, a valid theorem $A \\vdash \\neg H$ can be formed, and all such theorems are logically equivalent. To implement this theory, an efficient template-based ATG algorithm is designed, and a Rectangular Automated Theorem Generator is developed. This research enables machines to transition from \"verifiers\" to \"discoverers\", opening up new avenues for fundamental research in the fields of logic and artificial intelligence.",

Classical results of Gold showed that language identification in the limit is impossible for essentially any interesting collection of languages. Later, Angluin gave a precise characterization of language collections for which this task is possible. Motivated by recent positive results for the related problem of language generation, we revisit the classic language identification problem in the setting where the learner is given the additional power of producing a list of $k$ guesses at each time step. The goal is to ensure that beyond some finite time, one of the guesses is correct at each time step. We give an exact characterization of collections of languages that can be $k$-list identified in the limit, based on a recursive version of Angluin's characterization (for language identification with a list of size $1$). This further leads to a conceptually appealing characterization: A language collection can be $k$-list identified in the limit if and only if the collection can be decomposed into $k$ collections of languages, each of which can be identified in the limit (with a list of size $1$). We also use our characterization to establish rates for list identification in the statistical setting where the input is drawn as an i.i.d. stream from a distribution supported on some language in the collection. Our results show that if a collection is $k$-list identifiable in the limit, then the collection can be $k$-list identified at an exponential rate, and this is best possible. On the other hand, if a collection is not $k$-list identifiable in the limit, then it cannot be $k$-list identified at any rate that goes to zero.",

        "abstract": "Accurate perception of the marine environment through robust multi-object tracking (MOT) is essential for ensuring safe vessel navigation and effective maritime surveillance. However, the complicated maritime environment often causes camera motion and subsequent visual degradation, posing significant challenges to MOT. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient Dual-branch Maritime SORT (DMSORT) method for maritime MOT. The core of the framework is a parallel tracker with affine compensation, which incorporates an object detection and re-identification (ReID) branch, along with a dedicated branch for dynamic camera motion estimation. Specifically, a Reversible Columnar Detection Network (RCDN) is integrated into the detection module to leverage multi-level visual features for robust object detection. Furthermore, a lightweight Transformer-based appearance extractor (Li-TAE) is designed to capture global contextual information and generate robust appearance features. Another branch decouples platform-induced and target-intrinsic motion by constructing a projective transformation, applying platform-motion compensation within the Kalman filter, and thereby stabilizing true object trajectories. Finally, a clustering-optimized feature fusion module effectively combines motion and appearance cues to ensure identity consistency under noise, occlusion, and drift. Extensive evaluations on the Singapore Maritime Dataset demonstrate that DMSORT achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, DMSORT attains the fastest runtime among existing ReID-based MOT frameworks while maintaining high identity consistency and robustness to jitter and occlusion.

Experiments on the Bird-Bench Mini-Dev set reveal that Multi-Agent discussion can improve small model performance, with up to 10.6% increase in Execution Accuracy for Qwen2.5-7b-Instruct seen after three rounds of discussion.

Nevertheless, these tools frequently exhibit usability limitations, as their generic warning messages do not sufficiently communicate important information to developers, resulting in misunderstandings or oversight of critical findings. In light of recent developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their text generation capabilities, our work investigates a hybrid approach that uses LLMs to tackle the SAST explainability challenges. In this paper, we present SAFE, an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) plugin that leverages GPT-4o to explain the causes, impacts, and mitigation strategies of vulnerabilities detected by SAST tools. Our expert user study findings indicate that the explanations generated by SAFE can significantly assist beginner to intermediate developers in understanding and addressing security vulnerabilities, thereby improving the overall usability of SAST tools.",

        "abstract": "The proliferation of AI-generated content has created an absurd communication theater where senders use LLMs to inflate simple ideas into verbose content, recipients use LLMs to compress them back into summaries, and as a consequence neither party engage with authentic content. LAAC (LLM as a Communicator) proposes a paradigm shift - positioning LLMs as intelligent communication intermediaries that capture the sender's intent through structured dialogue and facilitate genuine knowledge exchange with recipients. Rather than perpetuating cycles of AI-generated inflation and compression, LAAC enables authentic communication across diverse contexts including academic papers, proposals, professional emails, and cross-platform content generation. However, deploying LLMs as trusted communication intermediaries raises critical questions about information fidelity, consistency, and reliability. This position paper systematically evaluates the trustworthiness requirements for LAAC's deployment across multiple communication domains. We investigate three fundamental dimensions: (1) Information Capture Fidelity - accuracy of intent extraction during sender interviews across different communication types, (2) Reproducibility - consistency of structured knowledge across multiple interaction instances, and (3) Query Response Integrity - reliability of recipient-facing responses without hallucination, source conflation, or fabrication. Through controlled experiments spanning multiple LAAC use cases, we assess these trust dimensions using LAAC's multi-agent architecture. Preliminary findings reveal measurable trust gaps that must be addressed before LAAC can be reliably deployed in high-stakes communication scenarios.",

Although recent theoretical studies have established the SLTH across various neural architectures, the SLTH for transformer architectures still lacks theoretical understanding. In particular, the current theory of the SLTH does not yet account for the multi-head attention (MHA) mechanism, a core component of transformers. To address this gap, we introduce a theoretical analysis of the existence of SLTs within MHAs. We prove that, if a randomly initialized MHA of $H$ heads and input dimension $d$ has the hidden dimension $O(d\\log(Hd^{3/2}))$ for the key and value, it contains an SLT that approximates an arbitrary MHA with the same input dimension with high probability. Furthermore, by leveraging this theory for MHAs, we extend the SLTH to transformers without normalization layers. We empirically validate our theoretical findings, demonstrating that the approximation error between the SLT within a source model (MHA and transformer) and an approximate target counterpart decreases exponentially by increasing the hidden dimension of the source model.",

Numerous noise-removal studies have improved recommendation models, but most existing approaches conduct denoising on a single graph. This may cause attenuation of collaborative signals: removing edges between two nodes can interrupt paths between other nodes, weakening path-dependent collaborative information. To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel GNN-based CF model called DRCSD for denoising unstable interactions. DRCSD includes two core modules: a collaborative signal decoupling module (decomposes signals into distinct orders by structural characteristics) and an order-wise denoising module (performs targeted denoising on each order). Additionally, the information aggregation mechanism of traditional GNN-based CF models is modified to avoid cross-order signal interference until the final pooling operation. Extensive experiments on three public real-world datasets show that DRCSD has superior robustness against unstable interactions and achieves statistically significant performance improvements in recommendation accuracy metrics compared to state-of-the-art baseline models.",

In this paper, we present a systematic analysis of the effect of multiple classes of non-semantic query perturbations in an multimedia information retrieval scenario. We evaluate a diverse set of lexical, syntactic, and semantic perturbations across multiple CLIP variants using the TRECVID Ad-Hoc Video Search queries and the V3C1 video collection. Across models, we find that syntactic and semantic perturbations drive the largest instabilities, while brittleness is concentrated in trivial surface edits such as punctuation and case.

Recent studies suggest that diffusion pipelines unintentionally imprint persistent statistical traces, known as signal leaks, within their outputs, particularly in latent representations. Building on this observation, we propose Proto-LeakNet, a signal-leak-aware and interpretable attribution framework that integrates closed-set classification with a density-based open-set evaluation on the learned embeddings, enabling analysis of unseen generators without retraining. Operating in the latent domain of diffusion models, our method re-simulates partial forward diffusion to expose residual generator-specific cues. A temporal attention encoder aggregates multi-step latent features, while a feature-weighted prototype head structures the embedding space and enables transparent attribution. Trained solely on closed data and achieving a Macro AUC of 98.13%, Proto-LeakNet learns a latent geometry that remains robust under post-processing, surpassing state-of-the-art methods, and achieves strong separability between known and unseen generators. These results demonstrate that modeling signal-leak bias in latent space enables reliable and interpretable AI-image and deepfake forensics.

        "abstract": "SRAM Processing-in-Memory (PIM) has emerged as the most promising implementation for high-performance PIM, delivering superior computing density, energy efficiency, and computational precision. However, the pursuit of higher performance necessitates more complex circuit designs and increased operating frequencies, which exacerbate IR-drop issues. Severe IR-drop can significantly degrade chip performance and even threaten reliability. Conventional circuit-level IR-drop mitigation methods, such as back-end optimizations, are resource-intensive and often compromise power, performance, and area (PPA). To address these challenges, we propose AIM, comprehensive software and hardware co-design for architecture-level IR-drop mitigation in high-performance PIM. Initially, leveraging the bit-serial and in-situ dataflow processing properties of PIM, we introduce Rtog and HR, which establish a direct correlation between PIM workloads and IR-drop. Building on this foundation, we propose LHR and WDS, enabling extensive exploration of architecture-level IR-drop mitigation while maintaining computational accuracy through software optimization. Subsequently, we develop IR-Booster, a dynamic adjustment mechanism that integrates software-level HR information with hardware-based IR-drop monitoring to adapt the V-f pairs of the PIM macro, achieving enhanced energy efficiency and performance. Finally, we propose the HR-aware task mapping method, bridging software and hardware designs to achieve optimal improvement. Post-layout simulation results on a 7nm 256-TOPS PIM chip demonstrate that AIM achieves up to 69.2% IR-drop mitigation, resulting in 2.29x energy efficiency improvement and 1.152x speedup.",

However, existing approaches to handling missing data in longitudinal clinical datasets are largely derived from static Bayesian networks literature, failing to properly account for the temporal nature of the data. This gap limits the ability to quantify uncertainty over time, which is particularly critical in settings such as intensive care, where understanding the temporal dynamics is fundamental for model trustworthiness and applicability across diverse patient groups. Despite the potential of DBNs, a full Bayesian framework that integrates missing data handling remains underdeveloped. In this work, we propose a novel Gibbs sampling-based method for learning DBNs from incomplete data. Our method treats each missing value as an unknown parameter following a Gaussian distribution. At each iteration, the unobserved values are sampled from their full conditional distributions, allowing for principled imputation and uncertainty estimation. We evaluate our method on both simulated datasets and real-world intensive care data from critically ill patients. Compared to standard model-agnostic techniques such as MICE, our Bayesian approach demonstrates superior reconstruction accuracy and convergence properties. These results highlight the clinical relevance of incorporating full Bayesian inference in temporal models, providing more reliable imputations and offering deeper insight into model behavior. Our approach supports safer and more informed clinical decision-making, particularly in settings where missing data are frequent and potentially impactful.",

Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in preserving musical content, structural consistency, and editing fidelity, establishing a strong foundation for controllable music editing in real-world scenarios.",

        "abstract": "Deep learning models achieve strong performance across various domains but often rely on spurious correlations, making them vulnerable to distribution shifts. This issue is particularly severe in subpopulation shift scenarios, where models struggle in underrepresented groups. While existing methods have made progress in mitigating this issue, their performance gains are still constrained. They lack a rigorous theoretical framework connecting the embedding space representations with worst-group error. To address this limitation, we propose Spurious Correlation-Aware Embedding Regularization for Worst-Group Robustness (SCER), a novel approach that directly regularizes feature representations to suppress spurious cues. We show theoretically that worst-group error is influenced by how strongly the classifier relies on spurious versus core directions, identified from differences in group-wise mean embeddings across domains and classes. By imposing theoretical constraints at the embedding level, SCER encourages models to focus on core features while reducing sensitivity to spurious patterns. Through systematic evaluation on multiple vision and language, we show that SCER outperforms prior state-of-the-art studies in worst-group accuracy.

Among other things, LLM agents are rapidly gaining momentum in their application to software development, with practitioners claiming a multifold productivity increase after adoption. Yet, empirical evidence is lacking around these claims. In this paper, we estimate the causal effect of adopting a widely popular LLM agent assistant, namely Cursor, on development velocity and software quality. The estimation is enabled by a state-of-the-art difference-in-differences design comparing Cursor-adopting GitHub projects with a matched control group of similar GitHub projects that do not use Cursor. We find that the adoption of Cursor leads to a significant, large, but transient increase in project-level development velocity, along with a significant and persistent increase in static analysis warnings and code complexity. Further panel generalized method of moments estimation reveals that the increase in static analysis warnings and code complexity acts as a major factor causing long-term velocity slowdown. Our study carries implications for software engineering practitioners, LLM agent assistant designers, and researchers.",

The method uses Koopman operator theory to transform the complex, nonlinear system dynamics into a linear representation, enabling the application of convex optimization while representing the complex PU accurately. The deep Koopman model utilizes neural networks to learn the linear dynamics from experimental data, achieving a 45% improvement in open-loop prediction accuracy over conventional N4SID subspace identification. Both analyzed models were employed in the EMPC formulation that includes interpretable economic costs, such as energy consumption, material losses due to inadequate pasteurization, and actuator wear. The feasibility of EMPC is ensured using slack variables. The deep Koopman EMPC and N4SID EMPC are numerically validated on a nonlinear model of multivariable PU under external disturbance. The disturbances include feed pump fail-to-close scenario and the introduction of a cold batch to be pastuerized. These results demonstrate that the deep Koopmand EMPC achieves a 32% reduction in total economic cost compared to the N4SID baseline. This improvement is mainly due to the reductions in material losses and energy consumption. Furthermore, the steady-state operation via Koopman-based EMPC requires 10.2% less electrical energy. The results highlight the practical advantages of integrating deep Koopman representations with economic optimization to achieve resource-efficient control of thermal-intensive plants.",

Traditional linear control techniques often fail in these contexts, necessitating innovative approaches. This paper introduces a novel approach to approximate the Koopman operator using an LSTM-enhanced Deep Koopman model, enabling linear representations of nonlinear systems with time delays. By incorporating Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers, the proposed framework captures historical dependencies and efficiently encodes time-delayed system dynamics into a latent space. Unlike traditional extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (eDMD) approaches that rely on predefined dictionaries, the LSTM-enhanced Deep Koopman model is dictionary-free, which mitigates the problems with the underlying dynamics being known and incorporated into the dictionary. Quantitative comparisons with extended eDMD on a simulated system demonstrate highly significant performance gains in prediction accuracy in cases where the true nonlinear dynamics are unknown and achieve comparable results to eDMD with known dynamics of a system.",

Q3R is based on a quadratic regularizer term which majorizes a smoothed log determinant serving as rank surrogate objective. Unlike other low-rank training techniques, Q3R is able to train weight matrices with prescribed, low target ranks of models that achieve comparable predictive performance as dense models, with small computational overhead, while remaining fully compatible with existing architectures. For example, we demonstrated one experiment where we are able to truncate $60\\%$ and $80\\%$ of the parameters of a ViT-Tiny model with $~1.3\\%$ and $~4\\%$ accuracy drop in CIFAR-10 performance respectively.

Existing evaluation frameworks often rely on heuristic-based metrics that fail to capture domain-specific nuances and other works utilize LLM-as-a-Judge approaches that lack validated alignment with human judgment. This paper introduces RAGalyst, an automated, human-aligned agentic framework designed for the rigorous evaluation of domain-specific RAG systems. RAGalyst features an agentic pipeline that generates high-quality, synthetic question-answering (QA) datasets from source documents, incorporating an agentic filtering step to ensure data fidelity. The framework refines two key LLM-as-a-Judge metrics-Answer Correctness and Answerability-using prompt optimization to achieve a strong correlation with human annotations. Applying this framework to evaluate various RAG components across three distinct domains (military operations, cybersecurity, and bridge engineering), we find that performance is highly context-dependent. No single embedding model, LLM, or hyperparameter configuration proves universally optimal. Additionally, we provide an analysis on the most common low Answer Correctness reasons in RAG. These findings highlight the necessity of a systematic evaluation framework like RAGalyst, which empowers practitioners to uncover domain-specific trade-offs and make informed design choices for building reliable and effective RAG systems.

        "abstract": "Algorithmic fairness has grown rapidly as a research area, yet key concepts remain unsettled, especially in criminal justice. We review group, individual, and process fairness and map the conditions under which they conflict. We then develop a simple modification to standard group fairness. Rather than exact parity across protected groups, we minimize a weighted error loss while keeping differences in false negative rates within a small tolerance. This makes solutions easier to find, can raise predictive accuracy, and surfaces the ethical choice of error costs. We situate this proposal within three classes of critique: biased and incomplete data, latent affirmative action, and the explosion of subgroup constraints. Finally, we offer a practical framework for deployment in public decision systems built on three pillars: need-based decisions, Transparency and accountability, and narrowly tailored definitions and solutions. Together, these elements link technical design to legitimacy and provide actionable guidance for agencies that use risk assessment and related tools.",

        "abstract": "When a language model generates text, the selection of individual tokens might lead it down very different reasoning paths, making uncertainty difficult to quantify. In this work, we consider whether reasoning language models represent the alternate paths that they could take during generation. To test this hypothesis, we use hidden activations to control and predict a language model's uncertainty during chain-of-thought reasoning. In our experiments, we find a clear correlation between how uncertain a model is at different tokens, and how easily the model can be steered by controlling its activations. This suggests that activation interventions are most effective when there are alternate paths available to the model -- in other words, when it has not yet committed to a particular final answer. We also find that hidden activations can predict a model's future outcome distribution, demonstrating that models implicitly represent the space of possible paths.",

We investigate how Large Language Models (LLM) can effectively act as world models of user preferences through pairwise reasoning over slates.

Our results reveal relationships between task performance and properties of the preference function captured by LLMs, hinting towards areas for improvement and highlighting the potential of LLMs as world models in recommender systems.",

        "abstract": "In domains such as healthcare, finance, and e-commerce, the temporal dynamics of relational data emerge from complex interactions-such as those between patients and providers, or users and products across diverse categories. To be broadly useful, models operating on these data must integrate long-range spatial and temporal dependencies across diverse types of entities, while also supporting multiple predictive tasks. However, existing graph models for relational data primarily focus on spatial structure, treating temporal information merely as a filtering constraint to exclude future events rather than a modeling signal, and are typically designed for single-task prediction. To address these gaps, we introduce a temporal subgraph sampler that enhances global context by retrieving nodes beyond the immediate neighborhood to capture temporally relevant relationships. In addition, we propose the Relational Graph Perceiver (RGP), a graph transformer architecture for relational deep learning that leverages a cross-attention-based latent bottleneck to efficiently integrate information from both structural and temporal contexts. This latent bottleneck integrates signals from different node and edge types into a common latent space, enabling the model to build global context across the entire relational system. RGP also incorporates a flexible cross-attention decoder that supports joint learning across tasks with disjoint label spaces within a single model. Experiments on RelBench, SALT, and CTU show that RGP delivers state-of-the-art performance, offering a general and scalable solution for relational deep learning with support for diverse predictive tasks.",

        "abstract": "A common approach to mechanistic interpretability is to causally manipulate model representations via targeted interventions in order to understand what those representations encode. Here we ask whether such interventions create out-of-distribution (divergent) representations, and whether this raises concerns about how faithful their resulting explanations are to the target model in its natural state. First, we demonstrate empirically that common causal intervention techniques often do shift internal representations away from the natural distribution of the target model. Then, we provide a theoretical analysis of two classes of such divergences: `harmless' divergences that occur in the null-space of the weights and from covariance within behavioral decision boundaries, and `pernicious' divergences that activate hidden network pathways and cause dormant behavioral changes. Finally, in an effort to mitigate the pernicious cases, we modify the Counterfactual Latent (CL) loss from Grant (2025) that regularizes interventions to remain closer to the natural distributions, reducing the likelihood of harmful divergences while preserving the interpretive power of interventions. Together, these results highlight a path towards more reliable interpretability methods.",
