        "abstract": "Localization is a fundamental capability in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems. Map-free LiDAR relocalization offers an effective solution for achieving high-precision positioning in environments with weak or unavailable GNSS signals. However, existing LiDAR relocalization methods are primarily tailored to autonomous driving, exhibiting significantly degraded accuracy in UAV scenarios. In this paper, we propose MAILS, a novel map-free LiDAR relocalization framework for UAVs. A Locality-Preserving Sliding Window Attention module is first introduced to extract locally discriminative geometric features from sparse point clouds. To handle substantial yaw rotations and altitude variations encountered during UAV flight, we then design a coordinate-independent feature initialization module and a locally invariant positional encoding mechanism, which together significantly enhance the robustness of feature extraction. Furthermore, existing LiDAR-based relocalization datasets fail to capture real-world UAV flight characteristics, such as irregular trajectories and varying altitudes. To address this gap, we construct a large-scale LiDAR localization dataset for UAVs, which comprises four scenes and various flight trajectories, designed to evaluate UAV relocalization performance under realistic conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves satisfactory localization precision and consistently outperforms existing techniques by a significant margin. Our code and dataset will be released soon.",

In this study, we explore the capability of this learning paradigm to mitigate bias and spurious correlations in visual classifiers, specifically in scenarios prone to data bias, such as gender classification. We investigate two methodologically different state-of-the-art XIL strategies, i.e., CAIPI and Right for the Right Reasons (RRR), as well as a novel hybrid approach that combines both strategies. The results are evaluated quantitatively by comparing segmentation masks with explanations generated using Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (GradCAM) and Bounded Logit Attention (BLA). Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods in (i) guiding ML models to focus on relevant image features, particularly when CAIPI is used, and (ii) reducing model bias (i.e., balancing the misclassification rates between male and female predictions). Our analysis further supports the potential of XIL methods to improve fairness in gender classifiers. Overall, the increased transparency and fairness obtained by XIL leads to slight performance decreases with an exception being CAIPI, which shows potential to even improve classification accuracy.",

        "abstract": "Cooperative perception enables autonomous agents to share encoded representations over wireless communication to enhance each other's live situational awareness. However, the tension between the limited communication bandwidth and the rich sensor information hinders its practical deployment. Recent studies have explored selection strategies that share only a subset of features per frame while striving to keep the performance on par. Nevertheless, the bandwidth requirement still stresses current wireless technologies. To fundamentally ease the tension, we take a proactive approach, exploiting the temporal continuity to identify features that capture environment dynamics, while avoiding repetitive and redundant transmission of static information. By incorporating temporal awareness, agents are empowered to dynamically adapt the sharing quantity according to environment complexity. We instantiate this intuition into an adaptive selection framework, COOPERTRIM, which introduces a novel conformal temporal uncertainty metric to gauge feature relevance, and a data-driven mechanism to dynamically determine the sharing quantity. To evaluate COOPERTRIM, we take semantic segmentation and 3D detection as example tasks. Across multiple open-source cooperative segmentation and detection models, COOPERTRIM achieves up to 80.28% and 72.52% bandwidth reduction respectively while maintaining a comparable accuracy. Relative to other selection strategies, COOPERTRIM also improves IoU by as much as 45.54% with up to 72% less bandwidth. Combined with compression strategies, COOPERTRIM can further reduce bandwidth usage to as low as 1.46% without compromising IoU performance. Qualitative results show COOPERTRIM gracefully adapts to environmental dynamics, localization error, and communication latency, demonstrating flexibility and paving the way for real-world deployment.",

However, current models remain overconfident, producing highly certain but incorrect answers. At the same time, their large size limits deployment on edge devices, necessitating compression. We study the intersection of these two challenges by analyzing how Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) compression affects both accuracy and reliability in Visual Question Answering (VQA). We evaluate two MLLMs, Qwen2-VL-7B and Idefics3-8B, quantized with data-free (HQQ) and data-aware (MBQ) methods across multiple bit widths. To counteract the reduction in reliability caused by quantization, we adapt the Selector confidence estimator for quantized multimodal settings and test its robustness across various quantization levels and out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. We find that PTQ degrades both accuracy and reliability. Data-aware methods soften the effect thereof. The Selector substantially mitigates the reliability impact. The combination of int4 MBQ and the Selector achieves the best efficiency-reliability trade-off, closing in on uncompressed performance at approx. 75% less memory demand. Overall, we present the first systematic study linking quantization and reliability in multimodal settings.",

These risks range from localized physical patches to imperceptible global perturbations. Existing defense methods for VLMs remain limited and often fail to reconcile robustness with clean-sample performance. To bridge these gaps, we propose NutVLM, a comprehensive self-adaptive defense framework designed to secure the entire perception-decision lifecycle. Specifically, we first employ NutNet++ as a sentinel, which is a unified detection-purification mechanism. It identifies benign samples, local patches, and global perturbations through three-way classification. Subsequently, localized threats are purified via efficient grayscale masking, while global perturbations trigger Expert-guided Adversarial Prompt Tuning (EAPT). Instead of the costly parameter updates of full-model fine-tuning, EAPT generates \"corrective driving prompts\" via gradient-based latent optimization and discrete projection. These prompts refocus the VLM's attention without requiring exhaustive full-model retraining. Evaluated on the Dolphins benchmark, our NutVLM yields a 4.89% improvement in overall metrics (e.g., Accuracy, Language Score, and GPT Score). These results validate NutVLM as a scalable security solution for intelligent transportation. Our code is available at this https URL.",

Most existing benchmarks rely on recognition-style protocols such as Visual Question Answering (VQA) and Violation of Expectation (VoE), which can often be answered without committing to an explicit, testable physical hypothesis. We propose VisPhyWorld, an execution-based framework that evaluates physical reasoning by requiring models to generate executable simulator code from visual observations. By producing runnable code, the inferred world representation is directly inspectable, editable, and falsifiable. This separates physical reasoning from rendering. Building on this framework, we introduce VisPhyBench, comprising 209 evaluation scenes derived from 108 physical templates and a systematic protocol that evaluates how well models reconstruct appearance and reproduce physically plausible motion. Our pipeline produces valid reconstructed videos in 97.7% on the benchmark. Experiments show that while state-of-the-art MLLMs achieve strong semantic scene understanding, they struggle to accurately infer physical parameters and to simulate consistent physical dynamics.",

However, the evaluation methods used in the state-ofthe-art of HRRP generation rely on classification models. Such models, called ''black-box'', do not allow either explainability on generated data or multi-level evaluation. This work focuses on decomposing HRRP data into three components: the mask, the features, and the noise. Using this decomposition, we propose two metrics based on the physical interpretation of those data. We take profit from an expensive dataset to evaluate our metrics on a challenging task and demonstrate the discriminative ability of those.",

We present a controlled comparative study of three canonical convolutional neural network architectures - VGG, ResNet, and GoogLeNet - to isolate how depth influences classification performance, convergence behavior, and computational efficiency. By standardizing training protocols and explicitly distinguishing between nominal and effective depth, we show that the benefits of depth depend critically on architectural mechanisms that constrain its effective manifestation during training rather than on nominal depth alone. Although plain deep networks exhibit early accuracy saturation and optimization instability, residual and inception-based architectures consistently translate additional depth into improved accuracy at lower effective depth and favorable accuracy-compute trade-offs. These findings demonstrate that effective depth, not nominal depth, is the operative quantity governing depth's role as a productive scaling dimension in convolutional networks.",

        "abstract": "Pediatric congenital hydronephrosis (CH) is a common urinary tract disorder, primarily caused by obstruction at the renal pelvis-ureter junction. Magnetic resonance urography (MRU) can visualize hydronephrosis, including renal pelvis and calyces, by utilizing the natural contrast provided by water. Existing voxel-based segmentation approaches can extract CH regions from MRU, facilitating disease diagnosis and prognosis. However, these segmentation methods predominantly focus on morphological features, such as size, shape, and structure. To enable functional assessments, such as urodynamic simulations, external complex post-processing steps are required to convert these results into mesh-level representations. To address this limitation, we propose an end-to-end method based on deep neural networks, namely KidMesh, which could automatically reconstruct CH meshes directly from MRU. Generally, KidMesh extracts feature maps from MRU images and converts them into feature vertices through grid sampling. It then deforms a template mesh according to these feature vertices to generate the specific CH meshes of MRU images. Meanwhile, we develop a novel schema to train KidMesh without relying on accurate mesh-level annotations, which are difficult to obtain due to the sparsely sampled MRU slices. Experimental results show that KidMesh could reconstruct CH meshes in an average of 0.4 seconds, and achieve comparable performance to conventional methods without requiring post-processing. The reconstructed meshes exhibited no self-intersections, with only 3.7% and 0.2% of the vertices having error distances exceeding 3.2mm and 6.4mm, respectively. After rasterization, these meshes achieved a Dice score of 0.86 against manually delineated CH masks. Furthermore, these meshes could be used in renal urine flow simulations, providing valuable urodynamic information for clinical practice.",

However, such manual ordering design can inevitably cause information loss and cumulative errors, lacking flexible and diverse relation modeling among different modules and sensors. Meanwhile, insufficient training of image backbone and quadratic-complexity of attention mechanism also hinder the scalability and efficiency of E2E-AD system to handle spatiotemporal input. To this end, we propose DriveMamba, a Task-Centric Scalable paradigm for efficient E2E-AD, which integrates dynamic task relation modeling, implicit view correspondence learning and long-term temporal fusion into a single-stage Unified Mamba decoder. Specifically, both extracted image features and expected task outputs are converted into token-level sparse representations in advance, which are then sorted by their instantiated positions in 3D space. The linear-complexity operator enables efficient long-context sequential token modeling to capture task-related inter-dependencies simultaneously. Additionally, a bidirectional trajectory-guided \"local-to-global\" scan method is designed to preserve spatial locality from ego-perspective, thus facilitating the ego-planning. Extensive experiments conducted on nuScenes and Bench2Drive datasets demonstrate the superiority, generalizability and great efficiency of DriveMamba.",

However, we demonstrate through an extensive analysis that standard deterministic inversion (e.g. DDIM) fails when the source domain is spectrally sparse compared to the target domain (e.g., super-resolution, sketch-to-image). In these contexts, the recovered latent from the input does not follow the expected isotropic Gaussian distribution. Instead it exhibits a signal with lower frequencies, locking target sampling to oversmoothed and texture-poor generations. We term this phenomenon spectral collapse. We observe that stochastic alternatives attempting to restore the noise variance tend to break the semantic link to the input, leading to structural drift. To resolve this structure-texture trade-off, we propose Orthogonal Variance Guidance (OVG), an inference-time method that corrects the ODE dynamics to enforce the theoretical Gaussian noise magnitude within the null-space of the structural gradient. Extensive experiments on microscopy super-resolution (BBBC021) and sketch-to-image (Edges2Shoes) demonstrate that OVG effectively restores photorealistic textures while preserving structural fidelity.",

We propose PCReg-Net, a progressive contrast-guided registration framework that performs coarse-to-fine alignment through four lightweight modules: (1)~a registration U-Net for coarse alignment, (2)~a reference feature extractor capturing multi-scale structural cues, (3)~a contrast module that identifies residual misalignment by comparing coarse-registered and reference features, and (4)~a refinement U-Net with feature injection for high-fidelity output. We further propose the Temporal NCC (TNCC) and Temporal NCC Gap (TNCG) for reference-free evaluation of inter-frame temporal consistency.

Early detection is critical, yet satellite-based monitoring remains challenging due to faint smoke signals, dynamic weather conditions, and the need for real-time analysis over large areas. We introduce WildfireVLM, an AI framework that combines satellite imagery wildfire detection with language-driven risk assessment. We construct a labeled wildfire and smoke dataset using imagery from Landsat-8/9, GOES-16, and other publicly available Earth observation sources, including harmonized products with aligned spectral bands. WildfireVLM employs YOLOv12 to detect fire zones and smoke plumes, leveraging its ability to detect small, complex patterns in satellite imagery. We integrate Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that convert detection outputs into contextualized risk assessments and prioritized response recommendations for disaster management. We validate the quality of risk reasoning using an LLM-as-judge evaluation with a shared rubric. The system is deployed using a service-oriented architecture that supports real-time processing, visual risk dashboards, and long-term wildfire tracking, demonstrating the value of combining computer vision with language-based reasoning for scalable wildfire monitoring.",

Prior machine-learning approaches show promise for visual creativity scoring, but many rely mainly on image features and provide limited or no explanatory feedback. We propose a framework for automated creativity assessment of human paintings by fine-tuning the vision-language model Qwen2-VL-7B with multi-task learning. Our dataset contains 1000 human-created paintings scored on a 1-100 scale and paired with a short human-written description (content or artist explanation). Two expert raters evaluated each work using a five-dimension rubric (originality, color, texture, composition, content) and provided written critiques; we use an 80/20 train-test split. We add a lightweight regression head on the visual encoder output so the model can predict a numerical score and generate rubric-aligned feedback in a single forward pass. By embedding the structured rubric and the artwork description in the system prompt, we constrain the generated text to match the quantitative prediction. Experiments show strong accuracy, achieving Pearson r > 0.97 and MAE about 3.95 on the 100-point scale. Qualitative evaluation indicates the generated feedback is semantically close to expert critiques (average SBERT cosine similarity = 0.798).

Nevertheless, this vertical scaling strategy often encounters plateaus in exploration as the model becomes locked into specific thinking pattern. By shifting from depth to parallelism, parallel thinking mitigates the narrowing of exploration. However, the extension of this paradigm to visual domain remains an open research question. In this paper, we first examine the role of visual partitioning in parallelized reasoning and subsequently propose two distinct strategies. Based on the above, we introduce Visual Para-Thinker, representing the inaugural parallel reasoning framework for MLLMs. To maintain path independence and promote diversity in reasoning, our approach integrates Pa-Attention alongside LPRoPE. Leveraging the vLLM framework, we have developed a native multimodal implementation that facilitates high-efficiency parallel processing. Empirical results on benchmark datasets such as V*, CountBench, RefCOCO, and HallusionBench confirm that Visual Para-Thinker successfully extends the benefits of parallel reasoning to the visual domain.",

Most existing approaches perform frame-wise spatial localization within a predicted temporal span, resulting in redundant computation, heavy supervision requirements, and limited generalization. Weakly-supervised variants mitigate annotation costs but remain constrained by the dataset-level train-and-fit paradigm with an inferior performance. To address these challenges, we propose the Agentic Spatio-Temporal Grounder (ASTG) framework for the task of STVG towards an open-world and training-free scenario. Specifically, two specialized agents SRA (Spatial Reasoning Agent) and TRA (Temporal Reasoning Agent) constructed leveraging on modern Multimoal Large Language Models (MLLMs) work collaboratively to retrieve the target tube in an autonomous and self-guided manner. Following a propose-and-evaluation paradigm, ASTG duly decouples spatio-temporal reasoning and automates the tube extraction, verification and temporal localization processes. With a dedicate visual memory and dialogue context, the retrieval efficiency is significantly enhanced. Experiments on popular benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach where it outperforms existing weakly-supervised and zero-shot approaches by a margin and is comparable to some of the fully-supervised methods.",

Evaluated on real-world indoor scenes, Sim2Radar improves downstream 3D radar perception via transfer learning: pre-training a radar point-cloud object detection model on synthetic data and fine-tuning on real radar yields up to +3.7 3D AP (IoU 0.3), with gains driven primarily by improved spatial localization.

We conduct extensive experiments across various model architectures and multimodal benchmarks, demonstrating that IDPruner achieves state-of-the-art performance and superior generalization across diverse architectures and tasks. Notably, on Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, IDPruner retains 95.18\\% of baseline performance when pruning 75\\% of the tokens, and still maintains 86.40\\% even under an extreme 90\\% pruning ratio.

We further extend the pipeline into an agentic Scout-Commander workflow, achieving 100% correct asset deployment and a 9.8/10 reasoning score (graded by GPT-4o) with sub-75-second latency. A novel \"Controlled Input\" methodology decouples perception from reasoning, revealing distinct failure phenotypes: Gemma3-12B excels at tactical logic but fails in visual perception, while Gemma3-4B exhibits reasoning collapse even with accurate inputs.

Existing methods struggle to generalize to multi-humanoid scenarios, which involve diverse humanoid forms, complex interactions, and frequent occlusions. We address this gap with two key innovations. First, we introduce unified motion representations that extract identity-agnostic motions and explicitly bind them to corresponding characters, enabling generalization across diverse humanoid forms and seamless extension to multi-humanoid scenarios. Second, we propose a holistic 4D-anchored paradigm that constructs a shared 4D space to fuse motion representations with video latents, and further reinforces this process with hierarchical 4D-level supervision to better handle interactions and occlusions. We instantiate these ideas in MotionWeaver, an end-to-end framework for multi-humanoid image animation. To support this setting, we curate a 46-hour dataset of multi-human videos with rich interactions, and construct a 300-video benchmark featuring paired humanoid characters. Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that MotionWeaver not only achieves state-of-the-art results on our benchmark but also generalizes effectively across diverse humanoid forms, complex interactions, and challenging multi-humanoid scenarios.",

Our framework enhances 3D spatial and temporal reasoning by integrating geometric awareness with fine-grained driving commands and state history prompting. To ensure computational efficiency, we integrate dynamic token sparsification into the VLA architecture. This approach fuses redundant tokens rather than filtering them, effectively reducing redundancy without sacrificing model performance. Furthermore, we employ a hierarchical transformer-based planner to progressively refine coarse VLA waypoints into fine-grained trajectories. Crucially, the planner utilizes dynamic latent regularization to incorporate language commands, ensuring strict spatial grounding and temporal coherence.

        "abstract": "Long-form clinical videos are central to visual evidence-based decision-making, with growing importance for applications such as surgical robotics and related settings. However, current multimodal large language models typically process videos with passive sampling or weakly grounded inspection, which limits their ability to iteratively locate, verify, and justify predictions with temporally targeted evidence. To close this gap, we propose MedScope, a tool-using clinical video reasoning model that performs coarse-to-fine evidence seeking over long-form procedures. By interleaving intermediate reasoning with targeted tool calls and verification on retrieved observations, MedScope produces more accurate and trustworthy predictions that are explicitly grounded in temporally localized visual evidence. To address the lack of high-fidelity supervision, we build ClinVideoSuite, an evidence-centric, fine-grained clinical video suite. We then optimize MedScope with Grounding-Aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (GA-GRPO), which directly reinforces tool use with grounding-aligned rewards and evidence-weighted advantages. On full and fine-grained video understanding benchmarks, MedScope achieves state-of-the-art performance in both in-domain and out-of-domain evaluations. Our approach illuminates a path toward medical AI agents that can genuinely \"think with videos\" through tool-integrated reasoning. We will release our code, models, and data.",

We propose a novel collaborative inference framework, which orchestrates a lightweight generalist ViT on an edge device and multiple medium-sized expert ViTs on a near-edge accelerator. A novel routing mechanism uses the edge model's Top-$\\mathit{k}$ predictions to dynamically select the most relevant expert for samples with low confidence. We further design a progressive specialist training strategy to enhance expert accuracy on dataset subsets. Extensive experiments on the CIFAR-100 dataset using a real-world edge and near-edge testbed demonstrate the superiority of our framework. Specifically, the proposed training strategy improves expert specialization accuracy by 4.12% on target subsets and enhances overall accuracy by 2.76% over static experts. Moreover, our method reduces latency by up to 45% compared to edge execution, and energy consumption by up to 46% compared to just near-edge offload.",

However, current approaches rely heavily on static sociodemographic and infrastructure metrics, frequently overlooking the impacts from drivers' visual perception of driving environment. Although visual environment features have been found to impact driving and traffic crashes, existing evidence remains largely observational, failing to establish the robust causality for traffic policy evaluation under complex spatial environment. To fill these gaps, we applied semantic segmentation on Google Street View imageries to extract visual environmental features and proposed a Double Machine Learning framework to quantify their causal effects on regional crashes. Meanwhile, we utilized SHAP values to characterize the nonlinear influence mechanisms of confounding variables in the models and applied causal forests to estimate conditional average treatment effects. Leveraging crash records from the Miami metropolitan area, Florida, and 220,000 street view images, evidence shows that greenery proportion exerts a significant and robust negative causal effect on traffic crashes (Average Treatment Effect = -6.38, p = 0.005). This protective effect exhibits spatial heterogeneity, being most pronounced in densely populated and socially vulnerable urban cores. While greenery significantly mitigates angle and rear-end crashes, its protective benefit for vulnerable road users (VRUs) remains limited. Our findings provide causal evidence for greening as a potential safety intervention, prioritizing hazardous visual environments while highlighting the need for distinct design optimizations to protect VRUs.",

To stabilize optimization and enhance controllability, we propose Asymmetric Gradient Optimization for DPO, DiffusionNFT with layout-aware OCR rewards for text editing, and a differentiable Consistency Loss for identity preservation. We further establish REDEdit-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark spanning 15 editing categories, including newly introduced beautification and low-level enhancement tasks.

Our evaluation shows that FOREST substantially improves the geometric agreement between predicted and true post-stow layouts compared with heuristic baselines. We further evaluate the predicted post-stow layouts in two downstream tasks, in which replacing the real post-stow masks with FOREST predictions causes only modest performance loss in load-quality assessment and multi-stow reasoning, indicating that our model can provide useful foresight signals for warehouse planning.",

Extensive research has been done in the field with a major focus on the English language which gives the scope for further developments in the same with consideration of popular foreign languages. This research utilizes distinct models for translating the image caption into Hindi, the fourth most popular language across the world. Exploring the multi-modal architectures this research comprises local visual features, global visual features, attention mechanisms, and pre-trained models. Using google cloud translator on the image dataset from Flickr8k, Hindi image descriptions have been generated. Pre-trained CNNs like VGG16, ResNet50, and Inception V3 helped in retrieving image characteristics, while the uni-directional and bi-directional techniques of text encoding are used for the text encoding process. An additional Attention layer helps to generate a weight vector and, by multiplying it, combine image characteristics from each time step into a sentence-level feature vector. Bilingual evaluation understudy scores are used to compare the research outcome. Many experiments that serve as a baseline are done for the comparative analysis of the research. An image with a score of BLEU-1 is considered sufficient, whereas one with a score of BLEU-4 is considered to have fluid image captioning. For both BLEU scores, the attention-based bidirectional LSTM with VGG16 produced the best results of 0.59 and 0.19 respectively. The experiments conclude that researchs ability to produce relevant, semantically accurate image captions in Hindi.

We introduce \\textbf{AdaCorrection}, an adaptive offset cache correction framework that maintains high generation fidelity while enabling efficient cache reuse across Transformer layers during diffusion inference. At each timestep, AdaCorrection estimates cache validity with lightweight spatio-temporal signals and adaptively blends cached and fresh activations.

        "abstract": "Blind image separation (BIS) refers to the inverse problem of simultaneously estimating and restoring multiple independent source images from a single observation image under conditions of unknown mixing mode and without prior knowledge of the source images. Traditional methods relying on statistical independence assumptions or CNN/GAN variants struggle to characterize complex feature distributions in real scenes, leading to estimation bias, texture distortion, and artifact residue under strong noise and nonlinear mixing. This paper innovatively introduces diffusion models into dual-channel BIS, proposing an efficient Dual-Channel Diffusion Separation Model (DCDSM). DCDSM leverages diffusion models' powerful generative capability to learn source image feature distributions and reconstruct feature structures effectively. A novel Wavelet Suppression Module (WSM) is designed within the dual-branch reverse denoising process, forming an interactive separation network that enhances detail separation by exploiting the mutual coupling noise characteristic between source images. Extensive experiments on synthetic datasets containing rain/snow and complex mixtures demonstrate that DCDSM achieves state-of-the-art performance: 1) In image restoration tasks, it obtains PSNR/SSIM values of 35.0023 dB/0.9549 and 29.8108 dB/0.9243 for rain and snow removal respectively, outperforming Histoformer and LDRCNet by 1.2570 dB/0.9272 dB (PSNR) and 0.0262/0.0289 (SSIM) on average; 2) For complex mixture separation, the restored dual-source images achieve average PSNR and SSIM of 25.0049 dB and 0.7997, surpassing comparative methods by 4.1249 dB and 0.0926. Both subjective and objective evaluations confirm DCDSM's superiority in addressing rain/snow residue removal and detail preservation challenges.",

In production, these systems process arbitrary inputs for which no ground-truth code exists, making output quality difficult to assess. We propose a reference-free evaluation framework that monitors flowchart image-to-code generation quality at inference time, using only the input image and the generated output. The framework introduces two automated metrics: $\\text{Recall}{\\text{OCR}}$, which estimates content coverage by extracting text from the input image via OCR as a proxy reference, and $\\text{Precision}{\\text{VE}}$, which detects hallucinated elements through Visual Entailment against the original image. Their harmonic mean, $\\text{F1}{\\text{OCR-VE}}$, provides a unified quality score. Validation on the FlowVQA dataset shows strong agreement with ground-truth metrics (average Pearson's $r = 0.97$, $0.91$, and $0.94$ for Recall, Precision, and F1, respectively), confirming the framework's reliability as a practical, reference-free alternative for continuous quality monitoring in production settings.",

Current detectors struggle with UAV-specific challenges: targets spanning only a few pixels, cluttered backgrounds, heavy occlusion, and strict onboard computational budgets. This study introduces LAF-YOLOv10, built on YOLOv10n, integrating four complementary techniques to improve small-object detection in drone imagery. A Partial Convolution C2f (PC-C2f) module restricts spatial convolution to one quarter of backbone channels, reducing redundant computation while preserving discriminative capacity. An Attention-Guided Feature Pyramid Network (AG-FPN) inserts Squeeze-and-Excitation channel gates before multi-scale fusion and replaces nearest-neighbor upsampling with DySample for content-aware interpolation. An auxiliary P2 detection head at 160$\\times$160 resolution extends localization to objects below 8$\\times$8 pixels, while the P5 head is removed to redistribute parameters. Wise-IoU v3 replaces CIoU for bounding box regression, attenuating gradients from noisy annotations in crowded aerial scenes. The four modules address non-overlapping bottlenecks: PC-C2f compresses backbone computation, AG-FPN refines cross-scale fusion, the P2 head recovers spatial resolution, and Wise-IoU stabilizes regression under label noise. No individual component is novel; the contribution is the joint integration within a single YOLOv10 framework. Across three training runs (seeds 42, 123, 256), LAF-YOLOv10 achieves 35.1$\\pm$0.3\\% mAP@0.5 on VisDrone-DET2019 with 2.3\\,M parameters, exceeding YOLOv10n by 3.3 points. Cross-dataset evaluation on UAVDT yields 35.8$\\pm$0.4\\% mAP@0.5. Benchmarks on NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano confirm 24.3 FPS at FP16, demonstrating viability for embedded UAV deployment.",

We present task-specific solutions tailored to the distinct supervision regimes. For Task 1 (long-tailed multi-label classification), we adopt an imbalance-aware multi-label learning strategy to improve recognition of tail classes while maintaining stable performance on frequent findings. For Task 2 (zero-shot OOD recognition), we propose a prediction approach that produces scores for unseen disease categories without using any supervised labels or examples from the OOD classes during training.

However, most unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) datasets focus on outdoor scenes and offer limited temporally coherent indoor videos. We introduce an indoor dataset of $14,400$ frames capturing inter-drone and ground vehicle footage, annotated via a semi-automatic workflow with a $98.6\\%$ first-pass labeling agreement before final manual verification. Using this dataset, we benchmark 3 replay-based CIL strategies: Experience Replay (ER), Maximally Interfered Retrieval (MIR), and Forgetting-Aware Replay (FAR), using YOLOv11-nano as a resource-efficient detector for deployment-constrained UAV platforms. Under tight memory budgets ($5-10\\%$ replay), FAR performs better than the rest, achieving an average accuracy (ACC, $mAP_{50-95}$ across increments) of $82.96\\%$ with $5\\%$ replay. Gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) analysis shows attention shifts across classes in mixed scenes, which is associated with reduced localization quality for drones. The experiments further demonstrate that replay-based continual learning can be effectively applied to edge aerial systems. Overall, this work contributes an indoor UAV video dataset with preserved temporal coherence and an evaluation of replay-based CIL under limited replay budgets. Project page: this https URL",

However, deploying Text VQA on wearable devices faces a fundamental tension: text recognition requires high-resolution video, but streaming high-quality video drains battery and causes thermal throttling. Moreover, existing models struggle to maintain coherent temporal context when processing text across multiple frames in real-time streams. We observe that text recognition and visual reasoning have asymmetric resolution requirements - OCR needs fine detail while scene understanding tolerates coarse features. We exploit this asymmetry with a hybrid architecture that performs selective high-resolution OCR on-device while streaming low-resolution video for visual context. On a benchmark of text-based VQA samples across five task categories, our system achieves 72% accuracy at 0.49x the power consumption of full-resolution streaming, enabling sustained VQA sessions on resource-constrained wearables without sacrificing text understanding quality.",

        "abstract": "Remote, video-based assessments offer a scalable pathway for Parkinson's disease (PD) screening. While traditional approaches rely on handcrafted features mimicking clinical scales, recent advances in video foundation models (VFMs) enable representation learning without task-specific customization. However, the comparative effectiveness of different VFM architectures across diverse clinical tasks remains poorly understood. We present a large-scale systematic study using a novel video dataset from 1,888 participants (727 with PD), comprising 32,847 videos across 16 standardized clinical tasks. We evaluate seven state-of-the-art VFMs -- including VideoPrism, V-JEPA, ViViT, and VideoMAE -- to determine their robustness in clinical screening. By evaluating frozen embeddings with a linear classification head, we demonstrate that task saliency is highly model-dependent: VideoPrism excels in capturing visual speech kinematics (no audio) and facial expressivity, while V-JEPA proves superior for upper-limb motor tasks. Notably, TimeSformer remains highly competitive for rhythmic tasks like finger tapping. Our experiments yield AUCs of 76.4-85.3% and accuracies of 71.5-80.6%. While high specificity (up to 90.3%) suggests strong potential for ruling out healthy individuals, the lower sensitivity (43.2-57.3%) highlights the need for task-aware calibration and integration of multiple tasks and modalities. Overall, this work establishes a rigorous baseline for VFM-based PD screening and provides a roadmap for selecting suitable tasks and architectures in remote neurological monitoring.

Recently, several works suggest that making sparse attention trainable can further increase sparsity while preserving generation quality. We study three key questions: (1) when do the two common masking rules, i.e., Top-k and Top-p, fail, and how can we avoid these failures? (2) why can trainable sparse attention reach higher sparsity than training-free methods? (3) what are the limitations of fine-tuning sparse attention using the diffusion loss, and how can we address them? Based on this analysis, we propose SpargeAttention2, a trainable sparse attention method that achieves high sparsity without degrading generation quality. SpargeAttention2 includes (i) a hybrid masking rule that combines Top-k and Top-p for more robust masking at high sparsity, (ii) an efficient trainable sparse attention implementation, and (iii) a distillation-inspired fine-tuning objective to better preserve generation quality during fine-tuning using sparse attention. Experiments on video diffusion models show that SpargeAttention2 reaches 95% attention sparsity and a 16.2x attention speedup while maintaining generation quality, consistently outperforming prior sparse attention methods.",

Recent methods based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have achieved photorealistic modeling in autonomous driving scene reconstruction, but they primarily focus on normal-light conditions. Low-light driving scenes are more challenging to model due to their complex lighting and appearance conditions, which often causes performance degradation of existing methods. To address this problem, this work presents a novel approach that integrates physically based rendering into 3DGS to enhance nighttime scene reconstruction for autonomous driving. Specifically, our approach integrates physically based rendering into composite scene Gaussian representations and jointly optimizes Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) based material properties. We explicitly model diffuse components through a global illumination module and specular components by anisotropic spherical Gaussians. As a result, our approach improves reconstruction quality for outdoor nighttime driving scenes, while maintaining real-time rendering. Extensive experiments across diverse nighttime scenarios on two real-world autonomous driving datasets, including nuScenes and Waymo, demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.",

While this improves perception performance, these systems also face a significant privacy-leakage issue, as sensitive visual content can potentially be reconstructed from the shared data. In this paper, we propose a novel Privacy-Concealing Cooperation (PCC) framework for Bird's Eye View (BEV) semantic segmentation. Based on commonly shared BEV features, we design a hiding network to prevent an image reconstruction network from recovering the input images from the shared features. An adversarial learning mechanism is employed to train the network, where the hiding network works to conceal the visual clues in the BEV features while the reconstruction network attempts to uncover these clues. To maintain segmentation performance, the perception network is integrated with the hiding network and optimized end-to-end. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed PCC framework effectively degrades the quality of the reconstructed images with minimal impact on segmentation performance, providing privacy protection for cooperating vehicles.

To provide a more flexible and efficient solution to this problem, we propose Diff-Aid, a lightweight inference-time method that adaptively adjusts per-token text and image interactions across transformer blocks and denoising timesteps. Beyond improving generation quality, Diff-Aid yields interpretable modulation patterns that reveal how different blocks, timesteps, and textual tokens contribute to semantic alignment during denoising. As a plug-and-play module, Diff-Aid can be seamlessly integrated into downstream applications for further improvement, including style LoRAs, controllable generation, and zero-shot editing.

        "abstract": "Inspired by the human visual system, which operates on two parallel yet interactive streams for contextual and spatial understanding, this article presents Two Interactive Streams (TwInS), a novel bio-inspired joint learning framework capable of simultaneously performing scene parsing and geometric vision tasks. TwInS adopts a unified, general-purpose architecture in which multi-level contextual features from the scene parsing stream are infused into the geometric vision stream to guide its iterative refinement. In the reverse direction, decoded geometric features are projected into the contextual feature space for selective heterogeneous feature fusion via a novel cross-task adapter, which leverages rich cross-view geometric cues to enhance scene parsing. To eliminate the dependence on costly human-annotated correspondence ground truth, TwInS is further equipped with a tailored semi-supervised training strategy, which unleashes the potential of large-scale multi-view data and enables continuous self-evolution without requiring ground-truth correspondences. Extensive experiments conducted on three public datasets validate the effectiveness of TwInS's core components and demonstrate its superior performance over existing state-of-the-art approaches. The source code will be made publicly available upon publication.",

        "abstract": "Visual attention boosting has emerged as a promising direction for mitigating hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), where existing methods primarily focus on where to boost by applying a predefined scaling to the attention of method-specific visual tokens during autoregressive generation. In this paper, we identify a fundamental trade-off in these methods: a predefined scaling factor can be too weak at some generation steps, leaving hallucinations unresolved, yet too strong at others, leading to new hallucinations. Motivated by this finding, we propose AdaVBoost, a token-level visual attention boosting framework that adaptively determines how much attention to boost at each generation step. Specifically, we introduce Visual Grounding Entropy (VGE) to estimate hallucination risk, which leverages visual grounding as a complementary signal to capture evidence mismatches beyond entropy. Guided by VGE, AdaVBoost applies stronger visual attention boosting to high-risk tokens and weaker boosting to low-risk tokens, enabling token-level adaptive intervention at each generation step. Extensive experiments show that AdaVBoost significantly outperforms baseline methods across multiple LVLMs and hallucination benchmarks.",

This variability limits consistent assessment, training, and the development of reliable artificial intelligence systems, as most surgical AI models are designed for narrowly defined tasks and do not generalize across procedures or institutions. Here we introduce ZEN, a generalizable foundation model for intraoperative surgical video understanding trained on more than 4 million frames from over 21 procedures using a self-supervised multi-teacher distillation framework. We curated a large and diverse dataset and systematically evaluated multiple representation learning strategies within a unified benchmark. Across 20 downstream tasks and full fine-tuning, frozen-backbone, few-shot and zero-shot settings, ZEN consistently outperforms existing surgical foundation models and demonstrates robust cross-procedure generalization. These results suggest a step toward unified representations for surgical scene understanding and support future applications in intraoperative assistance and surgical training assessment.",

        "abstract": "Recent video generative models have demonstrated impressive visual fidelity, yet they often struggle with semantic, geometric, and identity consistency. In this paper, we propose a system-level framework, termed the Divide-and-Conquer Diffusion Model (DCDM), to address three key challenges: (1) intra-clip world knowledge consistency, (2) inter-clip camera consistency, and (3) inter-shot element consistency. DCDM decomposes video consistency modeling under these scenarios into three dedicated components while sharing a unified video generation backbone. For intra-clip consistency, DCDM leverages a large language model to parse input prompts into structured semantic representations, which are subsequently translated into coherent video content by a diffusion transformer. For inter-clip camera consistency, we propose a temporal camera representation in the noise space that enables precise and stable camera motion control, along with a text-to-image initialization mechanism to further enhance controllability. For inter-shot consistency, DCDM adopts a holistic scene generation paradigm with windowed cross-attention and sparse inter-shot self-attention, ensuring long-range narrative coherence while maintaining computational efficiency. We validate our framework on the test set of the CVM Competition at AAAI'26, and the results demonstrate that the proposed strategies effectively address these challenges.",

The dataset consists of 1,534 questions with 2,043 associated images from Korean Medical Licensing Examinations (2012-2023), with about 30% containing multiple images requiring cross-image evidence integration. Images cover clinical modalities including X-ray, computed tomography (CT), electrocardiography (ECG), ultrasound, endoscopy, and other medical visuals. We benchmark over 50 VLMs across proprietary and open-source categories-spanning general-purpose, medical-specialized, and Korean-specialized families-under a unified zero-shot evaluation protocol. The best proprietary model (Gemini-3.0-Pro) achieves 96.9% accuracy, the best open-source model (Qwen3-VL-32B-Thinking) 83.7%, and the best Korean-specialized model (VARCO-VISION-2.0-14B) only 43.2%. We further find that reasoning-oriented model variants gain up to +20 percentage points over instruction-tuned counterparts, medical domain specialization yields inconsistent gains over strong general-purpose baselines, all models degrade on multi-image questions, and performance varies notably across imaging modalities. By complementing the text-only KorMedMCQA benchmark, KorMedMCQA-V forms a unified evaluation suite for Korean medical reasoning across text-only and multimodal conditions.

We introduce a personalized data acquisition strategy in which an RL agent, given a partially observed multi-view study, selects the next view to acquire or terminates acquisition to support heart-failure (HF) assessment. Upon termination, a diagnostic model jointly predicts aortic stenosis (AS) severity and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), two key HF biomarkers, and outputs uncertainty, enabling an explicit trade-off between diagnostic performance and acquisition cost. Methods: We model POCUS as a sequential acquisition problem: at each step, a video selector (RL agent) chooses the next view to acquire or terminates acquisition. Upon termination, a shared multi-view transformer performs multi-task inference with two heads, ordinal AS classification, and LVEF regression, and outputs Gaussian predictive distributions yielding ordinal probabilities over AS classes and EF thresholds. These probabilities drive a reward that balances expected diagnostic benefit against acquisition cost, producing patient-specific acquisition pathways. Results: The dataset comprises 12,180 patient-level studies, split into training/validation/test sets (75/15/15). On the 1,820 test studies, our method matches full-study performance while using 32% fewer videos, achieving 77.2% mean balanced accuracy (bACC) across AS severity classification and LVEF estimation, demonstrating robust multi-task performance under acquisition budgets. Conclusion: Patient-tailored, cost-aware acquisition can streamline POCUS workflows while preserving decision quality, producing interpretable scan pathways suited to bedside use. The framework is extensible to additional cardiac endpoints and merits prospective evaluation for clinical integration.",

However, their application in domain-specific agricultural tasks, such as plant pathology, remains limited due to the lack of large-scale, comprehensive multimodal image--text datasets and benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce LeafNet, a comprehensive multimodal dataset, and LeafBench, a visual question-answering benchmark developed to systematically evaluate the capabilities of VLMs in understanding plant diseases. The dataset comprises 186,000 leaf digital images spanning 97 disease classes, paired with metadata, generating 13,950 question-answer pairs spanning six critical agricultural tasks. The questions assess various aspects of plant pathology understanding, including visual symptom recognition, taxonomic relationships, and diagnostic reasoning. Benchmarking 12 state-of-the-art VLMs on our LeafBench dataset, we reveal substantial disparity in their disease understanding capabilities. Our study shows performance varies markedly across tasks: binary healthy--diseased classification exceeds 90\\% accuracy, while fine-grained pathogen and species identification remains below 65\\%. Direct comparison between vision-only models and VLMs demonstrates the critical advantage of multimodal architectures: fine-tuned VLMs outperform traditional vision models, confirming that integrating linguistic representations significantly enhances diagnostic precision. These findings highlight critical gaps in current VLMs for plant pathology applications and underscore the need for LeafBench as a rigorous framework for methodological advancement and progress evaluation toward reliable AI-assisted plant disease diagnosis.

To this end, we propose EchoTorrent, a novel schema with a fourfold design: (1) Multi-Teacher Training fine-tunes a pre-trained model on distinct preference domains to obtain specialized domain experts, which sequentially transfer domain-specific knowledge to a student model; (2) Adaptive CFG Calibration (ACC-DMD), which calibrates the audio CFG augmentation errors in DMD via a phased spatiotemporal schedule, eliminating redundant CFG computations and enabling single-pass inference per step; (3) Hybrid Long Tail Forcing, which enforces alignment exclusively on tail frames during long-horizon self-rollout training via a causal-bidirectional hybrid architecture, effectively mitigates spatiotemporal degradation in streaming mode while enhancing fidelity to reference frames; and (4) VAE Decoder Refiner through pixel-domain optimization of the VAE decoder to recover high-frequency details while circumventing latent-space ambiguities. Extensive experiments and analysis demonstrate that EchoTorrent achieves few-pass autoregressive generation with substantially extended temporal consistency, identity preservation, and audio-lip synchronization.",

This study focuses on waste segregation, a crucial step in recycling processes to obtain raw material. Recent advancements in computer vision have significantly contributed to waste classification and recognition. In waste segregation, segmentation masks are essential for robots to accurately localize and pick objects from conveyor belts. The complexity of real-world waste environments, characterized by deformed items without specific patterns and overlapping objects, further complicates waste segmentation tasks. This paper proposes an Ensemble Learning approach to improve segmentation accuracy by combining high performing segmentation models, U-Net and FPN, using a weighted average method. U-Net excels in capturing fine details and boundaries in segmentation tasks, while FPN effectively handles scale variation and context in complex environments, and their combined masks result in more precise predictions. The dataset used closely mimics real-life waste scenarios, and preprocessing techniques were applied to enhance feature learning for deep learning segmentation models. The ensemble model, referred to as EL-4, achieved an IoU value of 0.8306, an improvement over U-Net's 0.8065, and reduced Dice loss to 0.09019 from FPN's 0.1183. This study could contribute to the efficiency of waste sorting at Material Recovery Facility, facilitating better raw material acquisition for recycling with minimal human intervention and enhancing the overall throughput.",

        "abstract": "Corneal Confocal Microscopy (CCM) is a sensitive tool for assessing small-fiber damage in Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (DPN), yet the development of robust, automated deep learning-based diagnostic models is limited by scarce labelled data and fine-grained variability in corneal nerve morphology. Although Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven foundation generative models excel at natural image synthesis, they often struggle in medical imaging due to limited domain-specific training, compromising the anatomical fidelity required for clinical analysis. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation (WDLoRA)-based multimodal generative framework for clinically guided CCM image synthesis. WDLoRA is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) mechanism that decouples magnitude and directional weight updates, enabling foundation generative models to independently learn the orientation (nerve topology) and intensity (stromal contrast) required for medical realism. By jointly conditioning on nerve segmentation masks and disease-specific clinical prompts, the model synthesises anatomically coherent images across the DPN spectrum (Control, T1NoDPN, T1DPN). A comprehensive three-pillar evaluation demonstrates that the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art visual fidelity (Fréchet Inception Distance (FID): 5.18) and structural integrity (Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM): 0.630), significantly outperforming GAN and standard diffusion baselines. Crucially, the synthetic images preserve gold-standard clinical biomarkers and are statistically equivalent to real patient data. When used to train automated diagnostic models, the synthetic dataset improves downstream diagnostic accuracy by 2.1% and segmentation performance by 2.2%, validating the framework's potential to alleviate data bottlenecks in medical AI.",

The preliminary results show that our localization VLM performs comparatively better than the other object detection methods, such as EfficientDet, with an mIOU of 0.94.

This paper presents RGA-Net (Reciprocal Gating and Attention-fusion Network), a novel deep learning framework specifically designed for smoke removal in robotic surgery workflows. Our approach addresses the unique challenges of surgical smoke-including dense, non-homogeneous distribution and complex light scattering-through a hierarchical encoder-decoder architecture featuring two key innovations: (1) a Dual-Stream Hybrid Attention (DHA) module that combines shifted window attention with frequency-domain processing to capture both local surgical details and global illumination changes, and (2) an Axis-Decomposed Attention (ADA) module that efficiently processes multi-scale features through factorized attention mechanisms. These components are connected via reciprocal cross-gating blocks that enable bidirectional feature modulation between encoder and decoder pathways. Extensive experiments on the DesmokeData and LSD3K surgical datasets demonstrate that RGA-Net achieves superior performance in restoring visual clarity suitable for robotic surgery integration. Our method enhances the surgeon-robot interface by providing consistently clear visualization, laying a technical foundation for alleviating surgeons' cognitive burden, optimizing operation workflows, and reducing iatrogenic injury risks in minimally invasive procedures. These practical benefits could be further validated through future clinical trials involving surgeon usability assessments.

This limitation primarily stems from the underutilization of intrinsic geometry during pixel-based feature decoding and the occurrence of inter-stage matching inconsistency caused by stage-wise bipartite matching. To tackle these challenges, we present IGOFormer, a novel query-based oriented object detector that explicitly integrates intrinsic geometry into feature decoding and enhances inter-stage matching stability. Specifically, we design an Intrinsic Geometry-aware Decoder, which enhances the object-related features conditioned on an object query by injecting complementary geometric embeddings extrapolated from their correlations to capture the geometric layout of the object, thereby offering a critical geometric insight into its orientation. Meanwhile, a Momentum-based Bipartite Matching scheme is developed to adaptively aggregate historical matching costs by formulating an exponential moving average with query-specific smoothing factors, effectively preventing conflicting supervisory signals arising from inter-stage matching inconsistency. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the superiority of our IGOFormer for aerial oriented object detection, achieving an AP$_{50}$ score of 78.00\\% on DOTA-V1.0 using Swin-T backbone under the single-scale setting.

These models typically rely on learning meaningful latent representations, which are particularly valuable given the high-dimensional nature of 3D medical images like brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Despite their potential, latent representations remain underexplored in terms of their structure, information content, and applicability to downstream clinical tasks. Investigating these representations is crucial for advancing the use of generative models in neuroimaging research and clinical decision-making. In this work, we develop multiple variational autoencoders (VAEs) to encode 3D brain MRI scans into compact latent space representations for generative and predictive applications. We systematically evaluate the effectiveness of the learned representations through three key analyses: (i) a quantitative and qualitative assessment of MRI reconstruction quality, (ii) a visualisation of the latent space structure using Principal Component Analysis, and (iii) downstream classification tasks on a proprietary dataset of euploid and Down syndrome individuals brain MRI scans. Our results demonstrate that the VAE successfully captures essential brain features while maintaining high reconstruction fidelity. The latent space exhibits clear clustering patterns, particularly in distinguishing individuals with Down syndrome from euploid controls.",

Our experimental results reveal that while different baseline models demonstrate strengths in areas such as text-to-motion semantic alignment, motion generalizability, and physical quality, most models struggle to achieve strong performance with Fine-grained Accuracy Evaluation.

We introduce OmniScience, a large-scale, high-fidelity multi-modal dataset comprising 1.5 million figure-caption-context triplets, spanning more than 10 major scientific disciplines. To obtain image caption data with higher information density and accuracy for multi-modal large-model training, we develop a dynamic model-routing re-captioning pipeline that leverages state-of-the-art multi-modal large language models to generate dense, self-contained descriptions by jointly synthesizing visual features, original figure captions, and corresponding in-text references authored by human scientists. The pipeline is further reinforced with rigorous quality filtering and alignment with human expert judgments, ensuring both factual accuracy and semantic completeness, and boosts the image-text multi-modal similarity score from 0.769 to 0.956. We further propose a caption QA protocol as a proxy task for evaluating visual understanding. Under this setting, Qwen2.5-VL-3B model finetuned on OmniScience show substantial gains over baselines, achieving a gain of 0.378 on MM-MT-Bench and a gain of 0.140 on MMMU.",

        "abstract": "Offline 3D multi-object tracking (MOT) is a critical component of the 4D auto-labeling (4DAL) process. It enhances pseudo-labels generated by high-performance detectors through the incorporation of temporal context. However, existing offline 3D MOT approaches are direct extensions of online frameworks and fail to fully exploit the advantages of offline setting. Moreover, these methods often depend on fixed upstream and customized architectures, limiting their adaptability. To address these limitations, we propose Offline-Poly, a general offline 3D MOT method based on a tracking-centric design. We introduce a standardized paradigm termed Tracking-by-Tracking (TBT), which operates exclusively on arbitrary off-the-shelf tracking outputs and produces offline-refined tracklets. This formulation decouples offline tracker from specific upstream detectors or trackers. Under the TBT paradigm, Offline-Poly accepts one or multiple coarse tracking results and processes them through a structured pipeline comprising pre-processing, hierarchical matching and fusion, and tracklet refinement. Each module is designed to capitalize on the two fundamental properties of offline tracking: resource unconstrainedness, which permits global optimization beyond real-time limits, and future observability, which enables tracklet reasoning over the full temporal horizon. Offline-Poly first eliminates short-term ghost tracklets and re-identifies fragmented segments using global scene context. It then constructs scene-level similarity to associate tracklets across multiple input sources. Finally, Offline-Poly refines tracklets by jointly leveraging local and global motion patterns. On nuScenes, we achieve SOTA performance with 77.6% AMOTA. On KITTI, it achieves leading results with 83.00% HOTA. Comprehensive experiments further validate the flexibility, generalizability, and modular effectiveness of Offline-Poly.",

As a result, motions that look plausible as joint trajectories often exhibit body self-penetration and Foot-Ground Contact (FGC) anomalies when visualized with a human body mesh, reducing the aesthetic appeal of generated dances and limiting their real-world applications. We address this skeleton-to-mesh gap by deriving physics-based rewards from the body mesh and applying Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tuning (RLFT) to steer the diffusion model toward physically plausible motion synthesis under mesh visualization. Our reward design combines (i) an imitation reward that measures a motion's general plausibility by its imitability in a physical simulator (penalizing penetration and foot skating), and (ii) a Foot-Ground Deviation (FGD) reward with test-time FGD guidance to better capture the dynamic foot-ground interaction in dance. However, we find that the physics-based rewards tend to push the model to generate freezing motions for fewer physical anomalies and better imitability. To mitigate it, we propose an anti-freezing reward to preserve motion dynamics while maintaining physical plausibility. Experiments on multiple dance datasets consistently demonstrate that our method can significantly improve the physical plausibility of generated motions, yielding more realistic and aesthetically pleasing dances.

Among these methods, semantic change detection (SCD) can more effectively interpret the multi-class information contained in bi-temporal RS imagery, providing semantic-level predictions that support dynamic change monitoring. However, due to the limited semantic understanding capability of the model and the inherent complexity of the SCD tasks, existing SCD methods face significant challenges in both performance and paradigm complexity. In this paper, we propose PerASCD, a SCD method driven by RS foundation model PerA, designed to enhance the multi-scale semantic understanding and overall performance. We introduce a modular Cascaded Gated Decoder (CG-Decoder) that simplifies complex SCD decoding pipelines while promoting effective multi-level feature interaction and fusion. In addition, we propose a Soft Semantic Consistency Loss (SSCLoss) to mitigate the numerical instability commonly encountered during SCD training. We further explore the applicability of multiple existing RS foundation models on the SCD task when equipped with the proposed decoder. Experimental results demonstrate that our decoder not only effectively simplifies the paradigm of SCD, but also achieves seamless adaptation across various vision encoders. Our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on two public benchmark datasets, validating its effectiveness. The code is available at this https URL.",

The optimization minimizes the Dirichlet energy of the induced winding field together with additional GWN-based constraints, allowing DiWR to compensate for non-uniform sampling, reduce the impact of noise, and downweight outliers during reconstruction, with no reliance on separate preprocessing. We evaluate DiWR on point clouds from 3D Gaussian Splatting, a computer-vision pipeline, and corrupted graphics benchmarks. Experiments show that DiWR produces plausible watertight surfaces on these challenging inputs and outperforms both traditional multi-stage pipelines and recent joint orientation-reconstruction methods.",

To address this challenge, our key insight is that real-world dynamics exhibits a multi-scale regularity from object to particle level. To this end, we design the multi-scale dynamics mechanism that factorizes complex motion fields. Within this formulation, we propose Gaussian sequences with multi-scale dynamics, a novel representation for dynamic 3D Gaussians derived through compositions of multi-level motion. This layered structure substantially alleviates ambiguity of reconstruction and promotes physically plausible dynamics. We further incorporate multi-modal priors from vision foundation models to establish complementary supervision, constraining the solution space and improving the reconstruction fidelity. Our approach enables accurate and globally consistent 4D reconstruction from monocular casual videos. Experiments of dynamic novel-view synthesis (NVS) on benchmark and real-world manipulation datasets demonstrate considerable improvements over existing methods.",

        "abstract": "Recent advances in auto-regressive transformers have achieved remarkable success in generative modeling. However, text-to-3D generation remains challenging, primarily due to bottlenecks in learning discrete 3D representations. Specifically, existing approaches often suffer from information loss during encoding, causing representational distortion before the quantization process. This effect is further amplified by vector quantization, ultimately degrading the geometric coherence of text-conditioned 3D shapes. Moreover, the conventional two-stage training paradigm induces an objective mismatch between reconstruction and text-conditioned auto-regressive generation. To address these issues, we propose View-aware Auto-Regressive 3D (VAR-3D), which intergrates a view-aware 3D Vector Quantized-Variational AutoEncoder (VQ-VAE) to convert the complex geometric structure of 3D models into discrete tokens. Additionally, we introduce a rendering-supervised training strategy that couples discrete token prediction with visual reconstruction, encouraging the generative process to better preserve visual fidelity and structural consistency relative to the input text. Experiments demonstrate that VAR-3D significantly outperforms existing methods in both generation quality and text-3D alignment.",

        "abstract": "Leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has become pivotal for advancing Universal Multimodal Embeddings (UME) in addressing diverse cross-modal tasks. Recent studies demonstrate that incorporating generative Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning can substantially enhance task-specific representations compared to discriminative methods. However, the generated reasoning CoTs of existing generative embedding methods are limited to the textual analysis of queries and are irrelevant to the retrieval of the targets. To address these limitations, we propose a reasoning-driven UME framework that integrates Embedder-Guided Reinforcement Learning (EG-RL) to optimize the Reasoner to produce evidential Traceability CoT (T-CoT). Our key contributions are threefold: (1) We design an EG-RL framework where the Embedder provides explicit supervision to the Reasoner, ensuring the generated CoT traces are aligned with embedding tasks. (2) We introduce T-CoT, which extracts critical multimodal cues to focus on retrieval-relevant elements and provides multimodal inputs for the Embedder. (3) With limited computational resources, our framework outperforms the pioneering embedding model on both MMEB-V2 and UVRB benchmarks. The integration of multimodal evidence in structured reasoning, paired with retrieval-oriented alignment, effectively strengthens cross-modal semantic consistency and boosts the fine-grained matching capability of the model as well as the generalization across complex scenarios. Our work demonstrates that targeted reasoning optimization can significantly improve multimodal embedding quality, providing a practical and efficient solution for reasoning-driven UME development.",

Nevertheless, because speckle patterns inherently encode both texture and fine anatomical details, effectively suppressing noise while preserving structural fidelity remains a significant challenge. In this study, we propose a prior-guided hierarchical instance-pixel contrastive learning model for ultrasound denoising, designed to promote noise-invariant and structure-aware feature representations by maximizing the separability between noisy and clean samples at both pixel and instance levels. Specifically, a statistics-guided pixel-level contrastive learning strategy is introduced to enhance distributional discrepancies between noisy and clean pixels, thereby improving local structural consistency. Concurrently, a memory bank is employed to facilitate instance-level contrastive learning in the feature space, encouraging representations that more faithfully approximate the underlying data distribution. Furthermore, a hybrid Transformer-CNN architecture is adopted, coupling a Transformer-based encoder for global context modeling with a CNN-based decoder optimized for fine-grained anatomical structure restoration, thus enabling complementary exploitation of long-range dependencies and local texture details. Extensive evaluations on two publicly available ultrasound datasets demonstrate that the proposed model consistently outperforms existing methods, confirming its effectiveness and superiority.",

Recent work hypothesized that behavioral alignment can be drastically improved through \\emph{generative} -- rather than \\emph{discriminative} -- classifiers, with far-reaching implications for models of human vision. Here, we instead show that the increased alignment of generative models can be largely explained by a seemingly innocuous resizing operation in the generative model which effectively acts as a low-pass filter. In a series of controlled experiments, we show that removing high-frequency spatial information from discriminative models like CLIP drastically increases their behavioral alignment. Simply blurring images at test-time -- rather than training on blurred images -- achieves a new state-of-the-art score on the model-vs-human benchmark, halving the current alignment gap between DNNs and human observers. Furthermore, low-pass filters are likely optimal, which we demonstrate by directly optimizing filters for alignment. To contextualize the performance of optimal filters, we compute the frontier of all possible pareto-optimal solutions to the benchmark, which was formerly unknown. We explain our findings by observing that the frequency spectrum of optimal Gaussian filters roughly matches the spectrum of band-pass filters implemented by the human visual system. We show that the contrast sensitivity function, describing the inverse of the contrast threshold required for humans to detect a sinusoidal grating as a function of spatiotemporal frequency, is approximated well by Gaussian filters of the specific width that also maximizes error consistency.",

Experimental results demonstrate that RPGD consistently recovers extrinsic parameters with accuracy comparable to the provided ground truth, achieving sub-pixel MPJPE reprojection error even in challenging, noisy settings. These results indicate that RPGD provides a practical and automatic solution for reliable extrinsic calibration of large-scale 3D HPE dataset collection.",

        "abstract": "Breast cancer screening programmes increasingly seek to move from one-size-fits-all interval to risk-adapted and personalized strategies. Deep learning (DL) has enabled image-based risk models with stronger 1- to 5-year prediction than traditional clinical models, but leading systems (e.g., Mirai) typically use convolutional backbones, very high-resolution inputs (>1M pixels) and simple multi-view fusion, with limited explicit modelling of contralateral asymmetry. We hypothesised that combining complementary inductive biases (convolutional and transformer-based) with explicit contralateral asymmetry modelling would allow us to match state-of-the-art 3-year risk prediction performance even when operating on substantially lower-resolution mammograms, indicating that using less detailed images in a more structured way can recover state-of-the-art accuracy. We present MamaDino, a mammography-aware multi-view attentional DINO model. MamaDino fuses frozen self-supervised DINOv3 ViT-S features with a trainable CNN encoder at 512x512 resolution, and aggregates bilateral breast information via a BilateralMixer to output a 3-year breast cancer risk score. We train on 53,883 women from OPTIMAM (UK) and evaluate on matched 3-year case-control cohorts: an in-distribution test set from four screening sites and an external out-of-distribution cohort from an unseen site. At breast-level, MamaDino matches Mirai on both internal and external tests while using ~13x fewer input pixels. Adding the BilateralMixer improves discrimination to AUC 0.736 (vs 0.713) in-distribution and 0.677 (vs 0.666) out-of-distribution, with consistent performance across age, ethnicity, scanner, tumour type and grade. These findings demonstrate that explicit contralateral modelling and complementary inductive biases enable predictions that match Mirai, despite operating on substantially lower-resolution mammograms.",

Existing models primarily rely on vision and language modalities; however, language alone lacks molecular specificity and offers limited pathological supervision, leading to representational bottlenecks. In this paper, we propose STAMP, a Spatial Transcriptomics-Augmented Multimodal Pathology representation learning framework that integrates spatially-resolved gene expression profiles to enable molecule-guided joint embedding of pathology images and transcriptomic data. Our study shows that self-supervised, gene-guided training provides a robust and task-agnostic signal for learning pathology image representations. Incorporating spatial context and multi-scale information further enhances model performance and generalizability. To support this, we constructed SpaVis-6M, the largest Visium-based spatial transcriptomics dataset to date, and trained a spatially-aware gene encoder on this resource. Leveraging hierarchical multi-scale contrastive alignment and cross-scale patch localization mechanisms, STAMP effectively aligns spatial transcriptomics with pathology images, capturing spatial structure and molecular variation. We validate STAMP across six datasets and four downstream tasks, where it consistently achieves strong performance. These results highlight the value and necessity of integrating spatially resolved molecular supervision for advancing multimodal learning in computational pathology.

MarsRetrieval includes three tasks: (1) paired image-text retrieval, (2) landform retrieval, and (3) global geo-localization, covering multiple spatial scales and diverse geomorphic origins. We propose a unified retrieval-centric protocol to benchmark multimodal embedding architectures, including contrastive dual-tower encoders and generative vision-language models.

        "abstract": "Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have demonstrated remarkable generative capabilities but remain highly computationally expensive. Previous acceleration methods, such as pruning and distillation, typically rely on a fixed computational capacity, leading to insufficient acceleration and degraded generation quality. To address this limitation, we propose \\textbf{Elastic Diffusion Transformer (E-DiT)}, an adaptive acceleration framework for DiT that effectively improves efficiency while maintaining generation quality. Specifically, we observe that the generative process of DiT exhibits substantial sparsity (i.e., some computations can be skipped with minimal impact on quality), and this sparsity varies significantly across samples. Motivated by this observation, E-DiT equips each DiT block with a lightweight router that dynamically identifies sample-dependent sparsity from the input latent. Each router adaptively determines whether the corresponding block can be skipped. If the block is not skipped, the router then predicts the optimal MLP width reduction ratio within the block. During inference, we further introduce a block-level feature caching mechanism that leverages router predictions to eliminate redundant computations in a training-free manner. Extensive experiments across 2D image (Qwen-Image and FLUX) and 3D asset (Hunyuan3D-3.0) demonstrate the effectiveness of E-DiT, achieving up to $\\sim$2$\\times$ speedup with negligible loss in generation quality.

SpatialID fundamentally decouples identity injection into face-relevant and context-free regions using a Spatial Mask Extractor derived from cross-attention responses. Furthermore, we introduce a Temporal-Spatial Scheduling strategy that dynamically adjusts spatial constraints - transitioning from Gaussian priors to attention-based masks and adaptive relaxation - to align with the diffusion generation dynamics. Extensive experiments on IBench demonstrate that SpatialID achieves state-of-the-art performance in text adherence (CLIP-T: 0.281), visual consistency (CLIP-I: 0.827), and image quality (IQ: 0.523), significantly eliminating background contamination while maintaining robust identity preservation.",

Here, we present LitePath, a deployment-friendly foundational framework designed to mitigate model over-parameterization and patch level redundancy. LitePath integrates LiteFM, a compact model distilled from three large PFMs (Virchow2, H-Optimus-1 and UNI2) using 190 million patches, and the Adaptive Patch Selector (APS), a lightweight component for task-specific patch selection. The framework reduces model parameters by 28x and lowers FLOPs by 403.5x relative to Virchow2, enabling deployment on low-power edge hardware such as the NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano Super. On this device, LitePath processes 208 slides per hour, 104.5x faster than Virchow2, and consumes 0.36 kWh per 3,000 slides, 171x lower than Virchow2 on an RTX3090 GPU. We validated accuracy using 37 cohorts across four organs and 26 tasks (26 internal, 9 external, and 2 prospective), comprising 15,672 slides from 9,808 patients disjoint from the pretraining data. LitePath ranks second among 19 evaluated models and outperforms larger models including H-Optimus-1, mSTAR, UNI2 and GPFM, while retaining 99.71% of the AUC of Virchow2 on average. To quantify the balance between accuracy and efficiency, we propose the Deployability Score (D-Score), defined as the weighted geometric mean of normalized AUC and normalized FLOP, where LitePath achieves the highest value, surpassing Virchow2 by 10.64%. These results demonstrate that LitePath enables rapid, cost-effective and energy-efficient pathology image analysis on accessible hardware while maintaining accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art PFMs and reducing the carbon footprint of AI deployment.",

However, they often suffer from severe extrapolation failure, where rapid error accumulation leads to significant temporal degradation when extending beyond training horizons. We identify that this failure primarily stems from the \\textit{spectral bias} of 3D positional embeddings and the lack of \\textit{dynamic priors} in noise sampling. To address these issues, we propose \\textbf{FLEX} (\\textbf{F}requency-aware \\textbf{L}ength \\textbf{EX}tension), a training-free inference-time framework that bridges the gap between short-term training and long-term inference. FLEX introduces Frequency-aware RoPE Modulation to adaptively interpolate under-trained low-frequency components while extrapolating high-frequency ones to preserve multi-scale temporal discriminability. This is integrated with Antiphase Noise Sampling (ANS) to inject high-frequency dynamic priors and Inference-only Attention Sink to anchor global structure. Extensive evaluations on VBench demonstrate that FLEX significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models at $6\\times$ extrapolation (30s duration) and matches the performance of long-video fine-tuned baselines at $12\\times$ scale (60s duration). As a plug-and-play augmentation, FLEX seamlessly integrates into existing inference pipelines for horizon extension. It effectively pushes the generation limits of models such as LongLive, supporting consistent and dynamic video synthesis at a 4-minute scale.

        "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success in object detection tasks, but their increasing complexity poses significant challenges for deployment on resource-constrained platforms. While model compression techniques such as pruning have emerged as essential tools, traditional magnitude-based pruning methods do not necessarily align with the true functional contribution of network components to task-specific performance. In this work, we present an explainability-inspired, layer-wise pruning framework tailored for efficient object detection. Our approach leverages a SHAP-inspired gradient--activation attribution to estimate layer importance, providing a data-driven proxy for functional contribution rather than relying solely on static weight magnitudes. We conduct comprehensive experiments across diverse object detection architectures, including ResNet-50, MobileNetV2, ShuffleNetV2, Faster R-CNN, RetinaNet, and YOLOv8, evaluating performance on the Microsoft COCO 2017 validation set. The results show that the proposed attribution-inspired pruning consistently identifies different layers as least important compared to L1-norm-based methods, leading to improved accuracy--efficiency trade-offs. Notably, for ShuffleNetV2, our method yields a 10\\% empirical increase in inference speed, whereas L1-pruning degrades performance by 13.7\\%. For RetinaNet, the proposed approach preserves the baseline mAP (0.151) with negligible impact on inference speed, while L1-pruning incurs a 1.3\\% mAP drop for a 6.2\\% speed increase. These findings highlight the importance of data-driven layer importance assessment and demonstrate that explainability-inspired compression offers a principled direction for deploying deep neural networks on edge and resource-constrained platforms while preserving both performance and interpretability.",

With high-entropy binary latents, BitDance lets each token represent up to $2^{256}$ states, yielding a compact yet highly expressive discrete representation. Sampling from such a huge token space is difficult with standard classification. To resolve this, BitDance uses a binary diffusion head: instead of predicting an index with softmax, it employs continuous-space diffusion to generate the binary tokens. Furthermore, we propose next-patch diffusion, a new decoding method that predicts multiple tokens in parallel with high accuracy, greatly speeding up inference. On ImageNet 256x256, BitDance achieves an FID of 1.24, the best among AR models. With next-patch diffusion, BitDance beats state-of-the-art parallel AR models that use 1.4B parameters, while using 5.4x fewer parameters (260M) and achieving 8.7x speedup. For text-to-image generation, BitDance trains on large-scale multimodal tokens and generates high-resolution, photorealistic images efficiently, showing strong performance and favorable scaling. When generating 1024x1024 images, BitDance achieves a speedup of over 30x compared to prior AR models. We release code and models to facilitate further research on AR foundation models.

        "abstract": "In real-world scenarios, the performance of semantic segmentation often deteriorates when processing low-quality (LQ) images, which may lack clear semantic structures and high-frequency details. Although image restoration techniques offer a promising direction for enhancing degraded visual content, conventional real-world image restoration (Real-IR) models primarily focus on pixel-level fidelity and often fail to recover task-relevant semantic cues, limiting their effectiveness when directly applied to downstream vision tasks. Conversely, existing segmentation models trained on high-quality data lack robustness under real-world degradations. In this paper, we propose Restoration Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation (RASS), which effectively integrates semantic image restoration into the segmentation process, enabling high-quality semantic segmentation on the LQ images directly. Specifically, we first propose a Semantic-Constrained Restoration (SCR) model, which injects segmentation priors into the restoration model by aligning its cross-attention maps with segmentation masks, encouraging semantically faithful image reconstruction. Then, RASS transfers semantic restoration knowledge into segmentation through LoRA-based module merging and task-specific fine-tuning, thereby enhancing the model's robustness to LQ images. To validate the effectiveness of our framework, we construct a real-world LQ image segmentation dataset with high-quality annotations, and conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world LQ benchmarks. The results show that SCR and RASS significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods in segmentation and restoration tasks. Code, models, and datasets will be available at this https URL.",

However, existing models mainly focus on the editing effects of intended objects and regions, often leading to unwanted changes in unintended regions. We present a post-training framework for Content-Consistent Editing (CoCoEdit) via region regularized reinforcement learning. We first augment existing editing datasets with refined instructions and masks, from which 40K diverse and high quality samples are curated as training set. We then introduce a pixel-level similarity reward to complement MLLM-based rewards, enabling models to ensure both editing quality and content consistency during the editing process. To overcome the spatial-agnostic nature of the rewards, we propose a region-based regularizer, aiming to preserve non-edited regions for high-reward samples while encouraging editing effects for low-reward samples. For evaluation, we annotate editing masks for GEdit-Bench and ImgEdit-Bench, introducing pixel-level similarity metrics to measure content consistency and editing quality. Applying CoCoEdit to Qwen-Image-Edit and FLUX-Kontext, we achieve not only competitive editing scores with state-of-the-art models, but also significantly better content consistency, measured by PSNR/SSIM metrics and human subjective ratings.",

However, forcing these models to textually characterize imperceptible low-level tampering traces inevitably leads to hallucinations, as linguistic modalities are insufficient to capture such fine-grained pixel-level inconsistencies. To overcome this, we propose ForgeryVCR, a framework that incorporates a forensic toolbox to materialize imperceptible traces into explicit visual intermediates via Visual-Centric Reasoning. To enable efficient tool utilization, we introduce a Strategic Tool Learning post-training paradigm, encompassing gain-driven trajectory construction for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and subsequent Reinforcement Learning (RL) optimization guided by a tool utility reward. This paradigm empowers the MLLM to act as a proactive decision-maker, learning to spontaneously invoke multi-view reasoning paths including local zoom-in for fine-grained inspection and the analysis of invisible inconsistencies in compression history, noise residuals, and frequency domains. Extensive experiments reveal that ForgeryVCR achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in both detection and localization tasks, demonstrating superior generalization and robustness with minimal tool redundancy.

Unlike prior approaches that rely solely on features extracted from the input image, GeoFusionLRM feeds back geometric cues through a dedicated transformer and fusion module, enabling the model to correct errors and enforce consistency with the conditioning image.

Yet, human perception is inherently multisensory, integrating sight, sound, and motion to reason about the world. Among these modalities, sound provides indispensable cues about spatial layout, off-screen events, and causal interactions, particularly in egocentric settings where auditory and visual signals are tightly coupled. To this end, we introduce EgoSound, the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate egocentric sound understanding in MLLMs. EgoSound unifies data from Ego4D and EgoBlind, encompassing both sighted and sound-dependent experiences. It defines a seven-task taxonomy spanning intrinsic sound perception, spatial localization, causal inference, and cross-modal reasoning. Constructed through a multi-stage auto-generative pipeline, EgoSound contains 7315 validated QA pairs across 900 videos. Comprehensive experiments on nine state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal that current models exhibit emerging auditory reasoning abilities but remain limited in fine-grained spatial and causal understanding. EgoSound establishes a challenging foundation for advancing multisensory egocentric intelligence, bridging the gap between seeing and truly hearing the world.",

Accurate, reliable detection of chestnuts on the orchard floor is crucial for developing low-cost, vision-guided automated harvesting technology. However, developing a reliable chestnut detection system faces challenges in complex environments with shading, varying natural light conditions, and interference from weeds, fallen leaves, stones, and other foreign on-ground objects, which have remained unaddressed. This study collected 319 images of chestnuts on the orchard floor, containing 6524 annotated chestnuts. A comprehensive set of 29 state-of-the-art real-time object detectors, including 14 in the YOLO (v11-13) and 15 in the RT-DETR (v1-v4) families at varied model scales, was systematically evaluated through replicated modeling experiments for chestnut detection. Experimental results show that the YOLOv12m model achieves the best mAP@0.5 of 95.1% among all the evaluated models, while the RT-DETRv2-R101 was the most accurate variant among RT-DETR models, with mAP@0.5 of 91.1%. In terms of mAP@[0.5:0.95], the YOLOv11x model achieved the best accuracy of 80.1%. All models demonstrate significant potential for real-time chestnut detection, and YOLO models outperformed RT-DETR models in terms of both detection accuracy and inference, making them better suited for on-board deployment.

To bridge the gap between preoperative planning and intraoperative execution, we present ARport, an augmented reality (AR) system that automatically maps pre-planned trocar layouts onto the patient's body surface, providing intuitive spatial guidance during surgical preparation. Methods: ARport, implemented on an optical see-through head-mounted display (OST-HMD), operates without any external sensors or markers, simplifying setup and enhancing workflow integration. It reconstructs the operative scene from RGB, depth, and pose data captured by the OST-HMD, extracts the patient's body surface using a foundation model, and performs surface-based markerless registration to align preoperative anatomical models to the extracted patient's body surface, enabling in-situ visualization of planned trocar layouts. A demonstration video illustrating the overall workflow is available online. Results: In full-scale human-phantom experiments, ARport accurately overlaid pre-planned trocar sites onto the physical phantom, achieving consistent spatial correspondence between virtual plans and real anatomy. Conclusion: ARport provides a fully marker-free and hardware-minimal solution for visualizing preoperative trocar plans directly on the patient's body surface.

        "abstract": "Spatial transcriptomics (ST) provides spatially resolved measurements of gene expression, enabling characterization of the molecular landscape of human tissue beyond histological assessment as well as localized readouts that can be aligned with morphology. Concurrently, the success of multimodal foundation models that integrate vision with complementary modalities suggests that morphomolecular coupling between local expression and morphology can be systematically used to improve histological representations themselves. We introduce Spatial Expression-Aligned Learning (SEAL), a vision-omics self-supervised learning framework that infuses localized molecular information into pathology vision encoders. Rather than training new encoders from scratch, SEAL is designed as a parameter-efficient vision-omics finetuning method that can be flexibly applied to widely used pathology foundation models. We instantiate SEAL by training on over 700,000 paired gene expression spot-tissue region examples spanning tumor and normal samples from 14 organs. Tested across 38 slide-level and 15 patch-level downstream tasks, SEAL provides a drop-in replacement for pathology foundation models that consistently improves performance over widely used vision-only and ST prediction baselines on slide-level molecular status, pathway activity, and treatment response prediction, as well as patch-level gene expression prediction tasks. Additionally, SEAL encoders exhibit robust domain generalization on out-of-distribution evaluations and enable new cross-modal capabilities such as gene-to-image retrieval. Our work proposes a general framework for ST-guided finetuning of pathology foundation models, showing that augmenting existing models with localized molecular supervision is an effective and practical step for improving visual representations and expanding their cross-modal utility.",

        "abstract": "Unified Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) require a visual representation that simultaneously supports high-fidelity reconstruction, complex semantic extraction, and generative suitability. However, existing visual tokenizers typically struggle to satisfy these conflicting objectives within a single framework. In this paper, we introduce UniWeTok, a unified discrete tokenizer designed to bridge this gap using a massive binary codebook ($\\mathit{2^{128}}$). For training framework, we introduce Pre-Post Distillation and a Generative-Aware Prior to enhance the semantic extraction and generative prior of the discrete tokens. In terms of model architecture, we propose a convolution-attention hybrid architecture with the SigLu activation function. SigLu activation not only bounds the encoder output and stabilizes the semantic distillation process but also effectively addresses the optimization conflict between token entropy loss and commitment loss. We further propose a three-stage training framework designed to enhance UniWeTok's adaptability cross various image resolutions and perception-sensitive scenarios, such as those involving human faces and textual content. On ImageNet, UniWeTok achieves state-of-the-art image generation performance (FID: UniWeTok 1.38 vs. REPA 1.42) while requiring a remarkably low training compute (Training Tokens: UniWeTok 33B vs. REPA 262B). On general-domain, UniWeTok demonstrates highly competitive capabilities across a broad range of tasks, including multimodal understanding, image generation (DPG Score: UniWeTok 86.63 vs. FLUX.1 [Dev] 83.84), and editing (GEdit Overall Score: UniWeTok 5.09 vs. OmniGen 5.06). We release code and models to facilitate community exploration of unified tokenizer and MLLM.",

        "abstract": "We present UniRef-Image-Edit, a high-performance multi-modal generation system that unifies single-image editing and multi-image composition within a single framework. Existing diffusion-based editing methods often struggle to maintain consistency across multiple conditions due to limited interaction between reference inputs. To address this, we introduce Sequence-Extended Latent Fusion (SELF), a unified input representation that dynamically serializes multiple reference images into a coherent latent sequence. During a dedicated training stage, all reference images are jointly constrained to fit within a fixed-length sequence under a global pixel-budget constraint. Building upon SELF, we propose a two-stage training framework comprising supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). In the SFT stage, we jointly train on single-image editing and multi-image composition tasks to establish a robust generative prior. We adopt a progressive sequence length training strategy, in which all input images are initially resized to a total pixel budget of $1024^2$, and are then gradually increased to $1536^2$ and $2048^2$ to improve visual fidelity and cross-reference consistency. This gradual relaxation of compression enables the model to incrementally capture finer visual details while maintaining stable alignment across references. For the RL stage, we introduce Multi-Source GRPO (MSGRPO), to our knowledge the first reinforcement learning framework tailored for multi-reference image generation. MSGRPO optimizes the model to reconcile conflicting visual constraints, significantly enhancing compositional consistency. We will open-source the code, models, training data, and reward data for community research purposes.",

We introduce HiVid, the first framework to leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) as a scalable human proxy to generate high-fidelity weights for both Video-on-Demand (VOD) and live streaming. We address 3 non-trivial challenges: (1) To extend LLMs' limited modality and circumvent token limits, we propose a perception module to assess frames in a local context window, autoregressively building a coherent understanding of the video. (2) For VOD with rating inconsistency across local windows, we propose a ranking module to perform global re-ranking with a novel LLM-guided merge-sort algorithm. (3) For live streaming which requires low-latency, online inference without future knowledge, we propose a prediction module to predict future weights with a multi-modal time series model, which comprises a content-aware attention and adaptive horizon to accommodate asynchronous LLM inference. Extensive experiments show HiVid improves weight prediction accuracy by up to 11.5\\% for VOD and 26\\% for live streaming over SOTA baselines. Real-world user study validates HiVid boosts streaming QoE correlation by 14.7\\%.",

We propose Freq-DP Net, a novel dual-branch network that fuses two complementary priors: a geometric prior from defocus disparity, modeled using an explicit cost volume, and a structural prior of the fence's global pattern, learned via Fast Fourier Convolution (FFC). An attention mechanism intelligently merges these cues for highly accurate fence segmentation. To validate our approach, we build and release a diverse benchmark with different fence varieties.

These benchmarks with the topological signatures establish a foundation for unified geometry-topology learning and enable systematic evaluation of topology-aware deep learning architectures for 3D shape analysis. Building on this foundation, we propose a deep learning-based significant persistent point selection method, \\textit{TopoGAT}, that learns to identify the most informative topological features directly from input data and the corresponding topological signatures, circumventing the limitations of hand-crafted statistical selection criteria. A comparative study verifies the superiority of the proposed method over traditional statistical approaches in terms of stability and discriminative power. Integrating the selected significant persistent points into standard point cloud classification and part-segmentation pipelines yields improvements in both classification accuracy and segmentation metrics.

By integrating a temporal filter based on optical flow analysis for detecting inter-frame redundancy and a spatial filter leveraging saliency detection for identifying visually significant regions, Sali-Cache intelligently manages memory allocation before entering computationally expensive attention operations. Experimental evaluation on the LLaVA 1.6 architecture demonstrates that our method achieves a 2.20x compression ratio in effective memory usage while maintaining 100% accuracy across BLEU, ROUGE-L, and Exact Match metrics.

Yet, most available grounding datasets provide sparse supervision, with insufficient and low-diversity labels that annotate only a small subset of task-relevant elements per screen, which limits both coverage and generalization; moreover, practical deployment requires efficiency to enable low-latency, on-device use. We introduce ScreenParse, a large-scale dataset for complete screen parsing, with dense annotations of all visible UI elements (boxes, 55-class types, and text) across 771K web screenshots (21M elements). ScreenParse is generated by Webshot, an automated, scalable pipeline that renders diverse urls, extracts annotations and applies VLM-based relabeling and quality filtering. Using ScreenParse, we train ScreenVLM, a compact, 316M-parameter vision language model (VLM) that decodes a compact ScreenTag markup representation with a structure-aware loss that upweights structure-critical tokens. ScreenVLM substantially outperforms much larger foundation VLMs on dense parsing (e.g., 0.592 vs. 0.294 PageIoU on ScreenParse) and shows strong transfer to public benchmarks. Moreover, finetuning foundation VLMs on ScreenParse consistently improves their grounding performance, suggesting that dense screen supervision provides transferable structural priors for UI understanding.

Primarily, two different kinds of error values are used: photometric error and re-projection error. The selection of error value is usually directly dependent on the selection of feature paradigm, photometric features, or geometric features. It is a trade-off between accuracy, robustness, and the possibility of loop closing. We investigate a third method that combines the strengths of both paradigms into a unified approach. Using densely sampled geometric feature descriptors, we replace the photometric error with a descriptor residual from a dense set of descriptors, thereby enabling the employment of sub-pixel accuracy in differential photometric methods, along with the expressiveness of the geometric feature descriptor. Experiments show that although the proposed strategy is an interesting approach that results in accurate tracking, it ultimately does not outperform pose optimization strategies based on re-projection error despite utilizing more information. We proceed to analyze the underlying reason for this discrepancy and present the hypothesis that the descriptor similarity metric is too slowly varying and does not necessarily correspond strictly to keypoint placement accuracy.",

        "abstract": "Skin cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide and early detection is critical for effective treatment. However, current AI diagnostic tools are often trained on datasets dominated by lighter skin tones, leading to reduced accuracy and fairness for people with darker skin. The International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) dataset, one of the most widely used benchmarks, contains over 70% light skin images while dark skins fewer than 8%. This imbalance poses a significant barrier to equitable healthcare delivery and highlights the urgent need for methods that address demographic diversity in medical imaging. This paper addresses this challenge of skin tone imbalance in automated skin cancer detection using dermoscopic images. To overcome this, we present a generative augmentation pipeline that fine-tunes a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on the image dark-skin subset of the ISIC dataset and generates synthetic dermoscopic images conditioned on lesion type and skin tone. In this study, we investigated the utility of these images on two downstream tasks: lesion segmentation and binary classification. For segmentation, models trained on the augmented dataset and evaluated on held-out real images show consistent improvements in IoU, Dice coefficient, and boundary accuracy. These evalutions provides the verification of Generated dataset. For classification, an EfficientNet-B0 model trained on the augmented dataset achieved 92.14% accuracy. This paper demonstrates that synthetic data augmentation with Generative AI integration can substantially reduce bias with increase fairness in conventional dermatological diagnostics and open challenges for future directions.",

        "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease characterized by systemic joint inflammation. Early diagnosis and tight follow-up are essential to the management of RA, as ongoing inflammation can cause irreversible joint damage. The detection of arthritis is important for diagnosis and assessment of disease activity; however, it often takes a long time for patients to receive appropriate specialist care. Therefore, there is a strong need to develop systems that can detect joint inflammation easily using RGB images captured at home. Consequently, we tackle the task of RA inflammation detection from RGB hand images. This task is highly challenging due to general issues in medical imaging, such as the scarcity of positive samples, data imbalance, and the inherent difficulty of the task itself. However, to the best of our knowledge, no existing work has explicitly addressed these challenges in RGB-based RA inflammation detection. This paper quantitatively demonstrates the difficulty of visually detecting inflammation by constructing a dedicated dataset, and we propose a inflammation detection framework with global local encoder that combines self-supervised pretraining on large-scale healthy hand images with imbalance-aware training to detect RA-related joint inflammation from RGB hand images. Our experiments demonstrated that the proposed approach improves F1-score by 0.2 points and Gmean by 0.25 points compared with the baseline model.",

        "abstract": "Visual Deformation Measurement (VDM) aims to recover dense deformation fields by tracking surface motion from camera observations. Traditional image-based methods rely on minimal inter-frame motion to constrain the correspondence search space, which limits their applicability to highly dynamic scenes or necessitates high-speed cameras at the cost of prohibitive storage and computational overhead. We propose an event-frame fusion framework that exploits events for temporally dense motion cues and frames for spatially dense precise estimation. Revisiting the solid elastic modeling prior, we propose an Affine Invariant Simplicial (AIS) framework. It partitions the deformation field into linearized sub-regions with low-parametric representation, effectively mitigating motion ambiguities arising from sparse and noisy events. To speed up parameter searching and reduce error accumulation, a neighborhood-greedy optimization strategy is introduced, enabling well-converged sub-regions to guide their poorly-converged neighbors, effectively suppress local error accumulation in long-term dense tracking. To evaluate the proposed method, a benchmark dataset with temporally aligned event streams and frames is established, encompassing over 120 sequences spanning diverse deformation scenarios. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline by 1.6% in survival rate. Remarkably, it achieves this using only 18.9% of the data storage and processing resources of high-speed video methods.",

VACE provides unified video control (reference guidance, structural conditioning, inpainting, and temporal extension) but assumes bidirectional attention over full sequences, making it incompatible with streaming pipelines that require fixed chunk sizes and causal attention. The key modification moves reference frames from the diffusion latent space into a parallel conditioning pathway, preserving the fixed chunk sizes and KV caching that autoregressive models require. This adaptation reuses existing pretrained VACE weights without additional training. Across 1.3B and 14B model scales, VACE adds 20-30% latency overhead for structural control and inpainting, with negligible VRAM cost relative to the base model. Reference-to-video fidelity is severely degraded compared to batch VACE due to causal attention constraints. A reference implementation is available at this https URL.",

When extended to large vision-language models (LVLMs), we find that naively adding visual inputs can cause existing multi-turn jailbreaks to be easily defended. For example, overly malicious visual input will easily trigger the defense mechanism of safety-aligned LVLMs, making the response more conservative. To address this, we propose MAPA: a multi-turn adaptive prompting attack that 1) at each turn, alternates text-vision attack actions to elicit the most malicious response; and 2) across turns, adjusts the attack trajectory through iterative back-and-forth refinement to gradually amplify response maliciousness. This two-level design enables MAPA to consistently outperform state-of-the-art methods, improving attack success rates by 11-35% on recent benchmarks against LLaVA-V1.6-Mistral-7B, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, Llama-3.2-Vision-11B-Instruct and GPT-4o-mini.",

This paper proposes pFedNavi, a structure-aware and dynamically adaptive personalized federated learning framework tailored for VLN. Our key idea is to personalize where it matters: pFedNavi adaptively identifies client-specific layers via layer-wise mixing coefficients, and performs fine-grained parameter fusion on the selected components (e.g., the encoder-decoder projection and environment-sensitive decoder layers) to balance global knowledge sharing with local specialization. We evaluate pFedNavi on two standard VLN benchmarks, R2R and RxR, using both ResNet and CLIP visual representations. Across all metrics, pFedNavi consistently outperforms the FedAvg-based VLN baseline, achieving up to 7.5% improvement in navigation success rate and up to 7.8% gain in trajectory fidelity, while converging 1.38x faster under non-IID conditions.",

The fine-grained deterioration embedding constructor (FDEC) is proposed to reconstruct the labeled multimodal embedded-feature dataset, enhancing sample representation. The fine-grained deterioration recalibration attention network (FDRA-Net) is proposed to emphasize signal variations and increase sensitivity to fine-grained deterioration on the rice surface. Experiments show that the proposed method achieves a classification accuracy of 99.89%. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, the detection accuracy is improved and the procedure is simplified. Furthermore, field detection demonstrates the advantages of accuracy and operational simplicity. The proposed method can also be extended to other agrifood in agriculture and food industry.",

        "abstract": "Spatial perception aims to estimate camera motion and scene structure from visual observations, a problem traditionally addressed through geometric modeling and physical consistency constraints. Recent learning-based methods have demonstrated strong representational capacity for geometric perception and are increasingly used to augment classical geometry-centric systems in practice. However, whether learning components should directly replace geometric estimation or instead serve as intermediate modules within such pipelines remains an open question. In this work, we address this gap and investigate an end-to-end modular framework for effective spatial reasoning, where learning proposes geometric hypotheses, while geometric algorithms dispose estimation decisions. In particular, we study this principle in the context of relative camera pose estimation on RGB-D sequences. Using VGGT as a representative learning model, we evaluate learning-based pose and depth proposals under varying motion magnitudes and scene dynamics, followed by a classical point-to-plane RGB-D ICP as the geometric backend. Our experiments on the TUM RGB-D benchmark reveal three consistent findings: (1) learning-based pose proposals alone are unreliable; (2) learning-proposed geometry, when improperly aligned with camera intrinsics, can degrade performance; and (3) when learning-proposed depth is geometrically aligned and followed by a geometric disposal stage, consistent improvements emerge in moderately challenging rigid settings. These results demonstrate that geometry is not merely a refinement component, but an essential arbiter that validates and absorbs learning-based geometric observations. Our study highlights the importance of modular, geometry-aware system design for robust spatial perception.",

This paper presents a controlled empirical study of VIO behavior under degraded sensing, examining faults affecting visual and inertial modalities across a range of operating regimes. Through systematic fault injection and quantitative evaluation, we observe a pronounced asymmetry in fault impact where degradations affecting visual sensing typically lead to bounded pose errors on the order of centimeters, whereas degradations affecting inertial sensing can induce substantially larger trajectory deviations, in some cases reaching hundreds to thousands of meters. These observations motivate greater emphasis on inertial reliability in the evaluation and design of XR systems for real-life industrial settings.",

A primary challenge w.r.t AU detection is the effective learning of discriminative and generalizable AU representations under conditions of limited annotated data. To address this, we propose a Hierarchical Vision-language Interaction for AU Understanding (HiVA) method, which leverages textual AU descriptions as semantic priors to guide and enhance AU detection. Specifically, HiVA employs a large language model to generate diverse and contextually rich AU descriptions to strengthen language-based representation learning. To capture both fine-grained and holistic vision-language associations, HiVA introduces an AU-aware dynamic graph module that facilitates the learning of AU-specific visual representations. These features are further integrated within a hierarchical cross-modal attention architecture comprising two complementary mechanisms: Disentangled Dual Cross-Attention (DDCA), which establishes fine-grained, AU-specific interactions between visual and textual features, and Contextual Dual Cross-Attention (CDCA), which models global inter-AU dependencies. This collaborative, cross-modal learning paradigm enables HiVA to leverage multi-grained vision-based AU features in conjunction with refined language-based AU details, culminating in robust and semantically enriched AU detection capabilities. Extensive experiments show that HiVA consistently surpasses state-of-the-art approaches. Besides, qualitative analyses reveal that HiVA produces semantically meaningful activation patterns, highlighting its efficacy in learning robust and interpretable cross-modal correspondences for comprehensive facial behavior analysis.",

To address this, we propose CoCoDiff, a novel training-free and low-cost style transfer framework that leverages pretrained latent diffusion models to achieve fine-grained, semantically consistent stylization. We identify that correspondence cues within generative diffusion models are under-explored and that content consistency across semantically matched regions is often neglected. CoCoDiff introduces a pixel-wise semantic correspondence module that mines intermediate diffusion features to construct a dense alignment map between content and style images. Furthermore, a cycle-consistency module then enforces structural and perceptual alignment across iterations, yielding object and region level stylization that preserves geometry and detail. Despite requiring no additional training or supervision, CoCoDiff delivers state-of-the-art visual quality and strong quantitative results, outperforming methods that rely on extra training or annotations.",

We introduce TikArt (Thinking Aperture), an aperture-guided agent that casts multi-step vision-language reasoning as a decision process over regions of interest. TikArt follows a Think-Aperture-Observe loop, alternating between language generation and two aperture actions: Zoom extracts rectangular crops, while Segment invokes SAM2 to obtain mask-based crops for irregular targets. After every action, the model must produce an explicit observation, turning local visual cues into persistent linguistic memory. Built on Qwen3-VL-8B, TikArt optimizes its reasoning policy with AGRPO, a GRPO-style reinforcement learning algorithm with a two-stage curriculum: it warms up segmentation actions and then jointly optimizes visual math, fine-grained VQA, and segmentation, using rewards that couple task success with purposeful aperture use. Experiments on V*, HR-Bench-4K/8K, MME-RealWorld-Lite, MMStar, RefCOCO, and ReasonSeg show consistent gains over the backbone and yield interpretable aperture trajectories for high-resolution reasoning.",

To address this problem, we propose a new lightweight differentiable mesh renderer leveraging the efficient rasterization process of 3DGS, named Gaussian Mesh Renderer (GMR), which tightly integrates the Gaussian and mesh representations. Each Gaussian primitive is analytically derived from the corresponding mesh triangle, preserving structural fidelity and enabling the gradient flow.

Tumor tissues are highly similar to precancerous lesions and non tumor instances often greatly exceed tumor instances in whole slide images (WSIs). These issues cause instance-semantic entanglement in multi-instance learning frameworks, degrading both model representation capability and interpretability. To address this, we propose an end-to-end prototype instance semantic disentanglement framework with low-rank regularized subspace clustering, PID-LRSC, in two aspects. First, we use secondary instance subspace learning to construct low-rank regularized subspace clustering (LRSC), addressing instance entanglement caused by an excessive proportion of non tumor instances. Second, we employ enhanced contrastive learning to design prototype instance semantic disentanglement (PID), resolving semantic entanglement caused by the high similarity between tumor and precancerous tissues. We conduct extensive experiments on multicentre pathology datasets, implying that PID-LRSC outperforms other SOTA methods. Overall, PID-LRSC provides clearer instance semantics during decision-making and significantly enhances the reliability of auxiliary diagnostic outcomes.",

MedVAR generates images in a coarse-to-fine manner and produces structured multi-scale representations suitable for downstream use. To support hierarchical generation, we curate a harmonized dataset of around 440,000 CT and MRI images spanning six anatomical regions.

        "abstract": "We introduce the Nexus Adapters, novel text-guided efficient adapters to the diffusion-based framework for the Structure Preserving Conditional Generation (SPCG). Recently, structure-preserving methods have achieved promising results in conditional image generation by using a base model for prompt conditioning and an adapter for structure input, such as sketches or depth maps. These approaches are highly inefficient and sometimes require equal parameters in the adapter compared to the base architecture. It is not always possible to train the model since the diffusion model is itself costly, and doubling the parameter is highly inefficient. In these approaches, the adapter is not aware of the input prompt; therefore, it is optimal only for the structural input but not for the input prompt. To overcome the above challenges, we proposed two efficient adapters, Nexus Prime and Slim, which are guided by prompts and structural inputs. Each Nexus Block incorporates cross-attention mechanisms to enable rich multimodal conditioning. Therefore, the proposed adapter has a better understanding of the input prompt while preserving the structure. We conducted extensive experiments on the proposed models and demonstrated that the Nexus Prime adapter significantly enhances performance, requiring only 8M additional parameters compared to the baseline, T2I-Adapter. Furthermore, we also introduced a lightweight Nexus Slim adapter with 18M fewer parameters than the T2I-Adapter, which still achieved state-of-the-art results. Code: this https URL",

        "abstract": "Rapid and accurate building damage assessment in the immediate aftermath of tornadoes is critical for coordinating life-saving search and rescue operations, optimizing emergency resource allocation, and accelerating community recovery. However, current automated methods struggle with the unique visual complexity of tornado-induced wreckage, primarily due to severe domain shift from standard pre-training datasets and extreme class imbalance in real-world disaster data. To address these challenges, we introduce a systematic experimental framework evaluating 79 open-source deep learning models, encompassing both Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers, across over 2,300 controlled experiments on our newly curated Quad-State Tornado Damage (QSTD) benchmark dataset. Our findings reveal that achieving operational-grade performance hinges on a complex interaction between architecture and optimization, rather than architectural selection alone. Most strikingly, we demonstrate that optimizer choice can be more consequential than architecture: switching from Adam to SGD provided dramatic F1 gains of +25 to +38 points for Vision Transformer and Swin Transformer families, fundamentally reversing their ranking from bottom-tier to competitive with top-performing CNNs. Furthermore, a low learning rate of 1x10^(-4) proved universally critical, boosting average F1 performance by +10.2 points across all architectures. Our champion model, ConvNeXt-Base trained with these optimized settings, demonstrated strong cross-event generalization on the held-out Tuscaloosa-Moore Tornado Damage (TMTD) dataset, achieving 46.4% Macro F1 (+34.6 points over baseline) and retaining 85.5% Ordinal Top-1 Accuracy despite temporal and sensor domain shifts.",

Although transformer-based OCR systems and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) achieve strong aggregate accuracy, metrics such as Character Error Rate (CER) and Word Error Rate (WER) provide limited insight into their reliability for scholarly use. We compare a dedicated OCR transformer (TrOCR) and a general-purpose Vision-Language Model (Qwen) on line-level historical English texts using length-weighted accuracy metrics and hypothesis driven error analysis. While Qwen achieves lower CER/WER and greater robustness to degraded input, it exhibits selective linguistic regularization and orthographic normalization that may silently alter historically meaningful forms. TrOCR preserves orthographic fidelity more consistently but is more prone to cascading error propagation. Our findings show that architectural inductive biases shape OCR error structure in systematic ways. Models with similar aggregate accuracy can differ substantially in error locality, detectability, and downstream scholarly risk, underscoring the need for architecture-aware evaluation in historical digitization workflows.",

However, existing approaches assume similar acquisition views (e.g., vehicle-mounted) and struggle in cross-view scenarios, where observations differ substantially due to viewpoint-dependent structural incompleteness and non-uniform point density. Accordingly, we formulate cross-view domain generalization for LiDAR semantic segmentation and propose a novel framework, termed CVGC (Cross-View Geometric Consistency). Specifically, we introduce a cross-view geometric augmentation module that models viewpoint-induced variations in visibility and sampling density, generating multiple cross-view observations of the same scene. Subsequently, a geometric consistency module enforces consistent semantic and occupancy predictions across geometrically augmented point clouds of the same scene. Extensive experiments on six public LiDAR datasets establish the first systematic evaluation of cross-view domain generalization for LiDAR semantic segmentation, demonstrating that CVGC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods when generalizing from a single source domain to multiple target domains with heterogeneous acquisition viewpoints.

Token-based planners are plagued by cumulative causal errors and irreversible decoding. In summary, the two dominant paradigms exhibit complementary strengths and weaknesses. In this paper, we propose DriveFine, a masked diffusion VLA model that combines flexible decoding with self-correction capabilities. In particular, we design a novel plug-and-play block-MoE, which seamlessly injects a refinement expert on top of the generation expert. By enabling explicit expert selection during inference and gradient blocking during training, the two experts are fully decoupled, preserving the foundational capabilities and generic patterns of the pretrained weights, which highlights the flexibility and extensibility of the block-MoE design. Furthermore, we design a hybrid reinforcement learning strategy that encourages effective exploration of refinement expert while maintaining training stability. Extensive experiments on NAVSIM v1, v2, and Navhard benchmarks demonstrate that DriveFine exhibits strong efficacy and robustness. The code will be released at this https URL.",

        "abstract": "You Only Look Once (YOLO) has been the prominent model for computer vision in deep learning for a decade. This study explores the novel aspects of YOLO26, the most recent version in the YOLO series. The elimination of Distribution Focal Loss (DFL), implementation of End-to-End NMS-Free Inference, introduction of ProgLoss + Small-Target-Aware Label Assignment (STAL), and use of the MuSGD optimizer are the primary enhancements designed to improve inference speed, which is claimed to achieve a 43% boost in CPU mode. This is designed to allow YOLO26 to attain real-time performance on edge devices or those without GPUs. Additionally, YOLO26 offers improvements in many computer vision tasks, including instance segmentation, pose estimation, and oriented bounding box (OBB) decoding. We aim for this effort to provide more value than just consolidating information already included in the existing technical documentation. Therefore, we performed a rigorous architectural investigation into YOLO26, mostly using the source code available in its GitHub repository and its official documentation. The authentic and detailed operational mechanisms of YOLO26 are inside the source code, which is seldom extracted by others. The YOLO26 architectural diagram is shown as the outcome of the investigation. This study is, to our knowledge, the first one presenting the CNN-based YOLO26 architecture, which is the core of YOLO26. Our objective is to provide a precise architectural comprehension of YOLO26 for researchers and developers aspiring to enhance the YOLO model, ensuring it remains the leading deep learning model in computer vision.",

        "abstract": "Vision Transformers (ViTs) have emerged as the state-of-the-art architecture in representation learning, leveraging self-attention mechanisms to excel in various tasks. ViTs split images into fixed-size patches, constraining them to a predefined size and necessitating pre-processing steps like resizing, padding, or cropping. This poses challenges in medical imaging, particularly with irregularly shaped structures like tumors. A fixed bounding box crop size produces input images with highly variable foreground-to-background ratios. Resizing medical images can degrade information and introduce artefacts, impacting diagnosis. Hence, tailoring variable-sized crops to regions of interest can enhance feature representation capabilities. Moreover, large images are computationally expensive, and smaller sizes risk information loss, presenting a computation-accuracy tradeoff. We propose VariViT, an improved ViT model crafted to handle variable image sizes while maintaining a consistent patch size. VariViT employs a novel positional embedding resizing scheme for a variable number of patches. We also implement a new batching strategy within VariViT to reduce computational complexity, resulting in faster training and inference times. In our evaluations on two 3D brain MRI datasets, VariViT surpasses vanilla ViTs and ResNet in glioma genotype prediction and brain tumor classification. It achieves F1-scores of 75.5% and 76.3%, respectively, learning more discriminative features. Our proposed batching strategy reduces computation time by up to 30% compared to conventional architectures. These findings underscore the efficacy of VariViT in image representation learning.

To address these complexities, we propose a multi-stage detection pipeline. Our architecture processes recontextualized images through a series of specialized steps targeting object-level fidelity, background consistency, and omission detection, leveraging a coordinated ensemble of open-source models, whose effectiveness is demonstrated through extensive experimental evaluations. Our approach enables a deeper understanding of where the models fail with an explanation; thus, we fill a gap in the field, as no prior methods offer such categorization and decomposition for this task.

As underlying models grow more powerful, researchers are exploring increasingly diverse conditioning signals, such as depth maps, edge maps, camera parameters, and reference images, to give users finer control over generation. Among different modalities, sketches are a natural and long-standing form of human communication, enabling rapid expression of visual concepts. Previous literature has largely focused on edge maps, often misnamed 'sketches', yet algorithms that effectively handle true freehand sketches, with their inherent abstraction and distortions, remain underexplored. We pursue the challenging goal of balancing photorealism with sketch adherence when generating images from freehand input. A key obstacle is the absence of ground-truth, pixel-aligned images: by their nature, freehand sketches do not have a single correct alignment. To address this, we propose a modulation-based approach that prioritizes semantic interpretation of the sketch over strict adherence to individual edge positions. We further introduce a novel loss that enables training on freehand sketches without requiring ground-truth pixel-aligned images. We show that our method outperforms existing approaches in both semantic alignment with freehand sketch inputs and in the realism and overall quality of the generated images.",

This survey presents the first systematic review of global solvers in geometric vision, unifying the field through a comprehensive taxonomy of three core paradigms: Branch-and-Bound (BnB), Convex Relaxation (CR), and Graduated Non-Convexity (GNC). We present their theoretical foundations, algorithmic designs, and practical enhancements for robustness and scalability, examining how each addresses the fundamental nonconvexity of geometric estimation problems. Our analysis spans ten core vision tasks, from Wahba problem to bundle adjustment, revealing the optimality-robustness-scalability trade-offs that govern solver selection. We identify critical future directions: scaling algorithms while maintaining guarantees, integrating data-driven priors with certifiable optimization, establishing standardized benchmarks, and addressing societal implications for safety-critical deployment.

However, they introduce significant ethical and legal risks, such as deepfakes and unauthorized use of copyrighted visual content. To address these risks, image immunization has emerged as a promising defense against AI-driven semantic manipulation. Yet, most existing approaches rely on image-specific adversarial perturbations that require individual optimization for each image, thereby limiting scalability and practicality. In this paper, we propose the first universal image immunization framework that generates a single, broadly applicable adversarial perturbation specifically designed for diffusion-based editing pipelines. Inspired by universal adversarial perturbation (UAP) techniques used in targeted attacks, our method generates a UAP that embeds a semantic target into images to be protected. Simultaneously, it suppresses original content to effectively misdirect the model's attention during editing. As a result, our approach effectively blocks malicious editing attempts by overwriting the original semantic content in the image via the UAP. Moreover, our method operates effectively even in data-free settings without requiring access to training data or domain knowledge, further enhancing its practicality and broad applicability in real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments show that our method, as the first universal immunization approach, significantly outperforms several baselines in the UAP setting. In addition, despite the inherent difficulty of universal perturbations, our method also achieves performance on par with image-specific methods under a more restricted perturbation budget, while also exhibiting strong black-box transferability across different diffusion models.",

While there is extensive research on the role of image information for perceptual tasks, the role of the temporal dimension remains less well understood: What can we learn about the world from long-term motion information? What properties does long-term motion information have for visual learning? We leverage recent success in point-track estimation, which offers an excellent opportunity to learn temporal representations and experiment on a variety of perceptual tasks. We draw 3 clear lessons: 1) Long-term motion representations contain information to understand actions, but also objects, materials, and spatial information, often even better than images. 2) Long-term motion representations generalize far better than image representations in low-data settings and in zero-shot tasks. 3) The very low dimensionality of motion information makes motion representations a better trade-off between GFLOPs and accuracy than standard video representations, and used together they achieve higher performance than video representations alone. We hope these insights will pave the way for the design of future models that leverage the power of long-term motion information for perception.",

Instead, it updates only a minimal set of parameters using Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (e.g. LoRA or VPT), guided by gradients calculated directly from the sparse observations available at inference time. This approach effectively grounds the foundation model's geometric prior in the scene-specific measurements, correcting distortions and misplaced structures.

SAILS leverages foundational models to decouple CISS into two stages: Zero-shot region extraction using Segment Anything Model (SAM), followed by semantic association through prototypes in a fixed feature space. SAILS incorporates selective intra-class clustering, resulting in multiple prototypes per class to better model intra-class variability. Our results demonstrate that, despite requiring no incremental training, SAILS typically surpasses the performance of existing training-based approaches on standard CISS datasets, particularly in long and challenging task sequences where forgetting tends to be most severe. By avoiding parameter updates, SAILS completely eliminates forgetting and maintains consistent, task-invariant performance.

In contrast, recent generic object trackers are often optimized for training targets, which limits robustness and generalization in unseen scenarios, and their occlusion reasoning remains coarse, lacking detailed modeling of occlusion patterns. To address these limitations in generalization and occlusion perception, we propose GOT-JEPA, a model-predictive pretraining framework that extends JEPA from predicting image features to predicting tracking models. Given identical historical information, a teacher predictor generates pseudo-tracking models from a clean current frame, and a student predictor learns to predict the same pseudo-tracking models from a corrupted version of the current frame. This design provides stable pseudo supervision and explicitly trains the predictor to produce reliable tracking models under occlusions, distractors, and other adverse observations, improving generalization to dynamic environments. Building on GOT-JEPA, we further propose OccuSolver to enhance occlusion perception for object tracking. OccuSolver adapts a point-centric point tracker for object-aware visibility estimation and detailed occlusion-pattern capture. Conditioned on object priors iteratively generated by the tracker, OccuSolver incrementally refines visibility states, strengthens occlusion handling, and produces higher-quality reference labels that progressively improve subsequent model predictions. Extensive evaluations on seven benchmarks show that our method effectively enhances tracker generalization and robustness.",

        "abstract": "Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) aims to segment a target object described by a natural language expression. Existing methods have evolved by leveraging the vision information into the language tokens. To more effectively exploit visual contexts for fine-grained segmentation, we propose a novel Visual Informative Part Attention (VIPA) framework for referring image segmentation. VIPA leverages the informative parts of visual contexts, called a visual expression, which can effectively provide the structural and semantic visual target information to the network. This design reduces high-variance cross-modal projection and enhances semantic consistency in an attention mechanism of the referring image segmentation. We also design a visual expression generator (VEG) module, which retrieves informative visual tokens via local-global linguistic context cues and refines the retrieved tokens for reducing noise information and sharing informative visual attributes. This module allows the visual expression to consider comprehensive contexts and capture semantic visual contexts of informative regions. In this way, our framework enables the network's attention to robustly align with the fine-grained regions of interest. Extensive experiments and visual analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our VIPA outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods on four public RIS benchmarks.",

        "abstract": "Human eye movements in visual recognition reflect a balance between foveal sampling and peripheral context. Task-driven hard-attention models for vision are often evaluated by how well their scanpaths match human gaze. However, common scanpath metrics can be strongly confounded by dataset-specific center bias, especially on object-centric datasets. Using Gaze-CIFAR-10, we show that a trivial center-fixation baseline achieves surprisingly strong scanpath scores, approaching many learned policies. This makes standard metrics optimistic and blurs the distinction between genuine behavioral alignment and mere central tendency. We then analyze a hard-attention classifier under constrained vision by sweeping foveal patch size and peripheral context, revealing a peripheral sweet spot: only a narrow range of sensory constraints yields scanpaths that are simultaneously (i) above the center baseline after debiasing and (ii) temporally human-like in movement statistics. To address center bias, we propose GCS (Gaze Consistency Score), a center-debiased composite metric augmented with movement similarity. GCS uncovers a robust sweet spot at medium patch size with both foveal and peripheral vision, that is not obvious from raw scanpath metrics or accuracy alone, and also highlights a \"shortcut regime\" when the field-of-view becomes too large. We discuss implications for evaluating active perception on object-centric datasets and for designing gaze benchmarks that better separate behavioral alignment from center bias.",

This ability is fundamental for wearable assistants to understand user goals and provide timely assistance, or to enable human-robot interaction. In this work, we present a method to improve the performance of STA predictions. Our contributions are two-fold: 1 We propose STAformer and STAformer plus plus, two novel attention-based architectures integrating frame-guided temporal pooling, dual image-video attention, and multiscale feature fusion to support STA predictions from an image-input video pair; 2 We introduce two novel modules to ground STA predictions on human behavior by modeling affordances. First, we integrate an environment affordance model which acts as a persistent memory of interactions that can take place in a given physical scene. We explore how to integrate environment affordances via simple late fusion and with an approach which adaptively learns how to best fuse affordances with end-to-end predictions. Second, we predict interaction hotspots from the observation of hands and object trajectories, increasing confidence in STA predictions localized around the hotspot. Our results show significant improvements on Overall Top-5 mAP, with gain up to +23p.p on Ego4D and +31p.p on a novel set of curated EPIC-Kitchens STA labels. We released the code, annotations, and pre-extracted affordances on Ego4D and EPIC-Kitchens to encourage future research in this area.",

The proposed method is motivated by the strong sensitivity of commonly used dimensionality reduction techniques, such as principal component analysis (PCA), to the choice of reduced dimension. Rather than selecting a single reduced dimension or averaging results across dimensions, we exploit complementary advantages of multiple reduced dimensions. At a given dimension, image samples are regarded as simplicial complexes, and persistent sheaf Laplacians are utilized to extract a multiscale localized topological spectral representation for individual image samples. Statistical summaries of the resulting spectra are then aggregated across scales and dimensions to form multiscale multi-dimensional image representations. We evaluate the proposed framework on the COIL20 and ETH80 image datasets using standard classification protocols. Experimental results show that the proposed method provides more stable performance across a wide range of reduced dimensions and achieves consistent improvements to PCA-based baselines in moderate dimensional regimes.",

        "abstract": "Maintaining spatial world consistency over long horizons remains a central challenge for camera-controllable video generation. Existing memory-based approaches often condition generation on globally reconstructed 3D scenes by rendering anchor videos from the reconstructed geometry in the history. However, reconstructing a global 3D scene from multiple views inevitably introduces cross-view misalignment, as pose and depth estimation errors cause the same surfaces to be reconstructed at slightly different 3D locations across views. When fused, these inconsistencies accumulate into noisy geometry that contaminates the conditioning signals and degrades generation quality. We introduce AnchorWeave, a memory-augmented video generation framework that replaces a single misaligned global memory with multiple clean local geometric memories and learns to reconcile their cross-view inconsistencies. To this end, AnchorWeave performs coverage-driven local memory retrieval aligned with the target trajectory and integrates the selected local memories through a multi-anchor weaving controller during generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AnchorWeave significantly improves long-term scene consistency while maintaining strong visual quality, with ablation and analysis studies further validating the effectiveness of local geometric conditioning, multi-anchor control, and coverage-driven retrieval.",

Yet producing high-fidelity articulated assets remains difficult to scale because it requires reliable part decomposition and kinematic rigging. Existing approaches largely fall into two paradigms: optimization-based reconstruction or distillation, which can be accurate but often takes tens of minutes to hours per instance, and inference-time methods that rely on template or part retrieval, producing plausible results that may not match the specific structure and appearance in the input observation. We introduce a part-centric generative framework for articulated object creation that synthesizes part geometry, composition, and articulation under explicit part-aware conditioning. Our representation models an object as a set of movable parts, each encoded by latent tokens augmented with part identity and articulation cues. Conditioned on a single image, the model generates articulated 3D assets that preserve instance-level correspondence while maintaining valid part structure and motion. The resulting approach avoids per-instance optimization, enables fast feed-forward inference, and supports controllable assembly and articulation, which are important for embodied interaction. Experiments on common articulated categories (e.g., drawers and doors) show improved input consistency, part accuracy, and articulation plausibility over optimization-based and retrieval-driven baselines, while substantially reducing inference time.",

Thermal sensing plays a critical role in settings where visible light fails, including nighttime surveillance, search and rescue, autonomous driving, and medical screening.

ThermEval-B integrates public datasets with our newly collected ThermEval-D, the first dataset to provide dense per-pixel temperature maps with semantic body-part annotations across diverse indoor and outdoor environments. Evaluating 25 open-source and closed-source VLMs, we find that models consistently fail at temperature-grounded reasoning, degrade under colormap transformations, and default to language priors or fixed responses, with only marginal gains from prompting or supervised fine-tuning. These results demonstrate that thermal understanding requires dedicated evaluation beyond RGB-centric assumptions, positioning ThermEval as a benchmark to drive progress in thermal vision language modeling.",

In this paper, we introduce EditCtrl, an efficient video inpainting control framework that focuses computation only where it is needed. Our approach features a novel local video context module that operates solely on masked tokens, yielding a computational cost proportional to the edit size. This local-first generation is then guided by a lightweight temporal global context embedder that ensures video-wide context consistency with minimal overhead. Not only is EditCtrl 10 times more compute efficient than state-of-the-art generative editing methods, it even improves editing quality compared to methods designed with full-attention. Finally, we showcase how EditCtrl unlocks new capabilities, including multi-region editing with text prompts and autoregressive content propagation.",

Existing VRAG frameworks usually depend on rigid, pre-defined external tools to extend the perceptual capabilities of VLMs, typically by explicitly separating visual perception from subsequent reasoning processes. However, this decoupled design can lead to unnecessary loss of visual information, particularly when image-based operations such as cropping are applied. In this paper, we propose Lang2Act, which enables fine-grained visual perception and reasoning through self-emergent linguistic toolchains. Rather than invoking fixed external engines, Lang2Act collects self-emergent actions as linguistic tools and leverages them to enhance the visual perception capabilities of VLMs. To support this mechanism, we design a two-stage Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based training framework. Specifically, the first stage optimizes VLMs to self-explore high-quality actions for constructing a reusable linguistic toolbox, and the second stage further optimizes VLMs to exploit these linguistic tools for downstream reasoning effectively.

        "abstract": "Timely and spatially resolved disaster impact assessment is essential for effective emergency response. However, automated methods typically struggle with temporal asynchrony. Real-time human reports capture peak hazard conditions while high-resolution satellite imagery is frequently acquired after peak conditions. This often reflects flood recession rather than maximum extent. Naive fusion of these misaligned streams can yield dangerous underestimates when post-event imagery overrides documented peak flooding. We present CrisiSense-RAG, which is a multimodal retrieval-augmented generation framework that reframes impact assessment as evidence synthesis over heterogeneous data sources without disaster-specific fine-tuning. The system employs hybrid dense-sparse retrieval for text sources and CLIP-based retrieval for aerial imagery. A split-pipeline architecture feeds into asynchronous fusion logic that prioritizes real-time social evidence for peak flood extent while treating imagery as persistent evidence of structural damage. Evaluated on Hurricane Harvey across 207 ZIP-code queries, the framework achieves a flood extent MAE of 10.94% to 28.40% and damage severity MAE of 16.47% to 21.65% in zero-shot settings. Prompt-level alignment proves critical for quantitative validity because metric grounding improves damage estimates by up to 4.75 percentage points. These results demonstrate a practical and deployable approach to rapid resilience intelligence under real-world data constraints.",

Active learning (AL) addresses this challenge by strategically selecting the most informative samples for the annotation purpose, but traditional methods solely rely on predictive uncertainty while ignoring whether models learn from clinically meaningful features a critical requirement for clinical deployment. We propose an explainability-guided active learning framework that integrates spatial attention alignment into a sample acquisition process. Our approach advocates for a dual-criterion selection strategy combining: (i) classification uncertainty to identify informative examples, and (ii) attention misalignment with radiologist-defined regions-of-interest (ROIs) to target samples where the model focuses on incorrect features. By measuring misalignment between Grad-CAM attention maps and expert annotations using \\emph{Dice similarity}, our acquisition function judiciously identifies samples that enhance both predictive performance and spatial interpretability. We evaluate the framework using three expert-annotated medical imaging datasets, namely, BraTS (MRI brain tumors), VinDr-CXR (chest X-rays), and SIIM-COVID-19 (chest X-rays). Using only 570 strategically selected samples, our explainability-guided approach consistently outperforms random sampling across all the datasets, achieving 77.22\\% accuracy on BraTS, 52.37\\% on VinDr-CXR, and 52.66\\% on SIIM-COVID. Grad-CAM visualizations confirm that the models trained by our dual-criterion selection focus on diagnostically relevant regions, demonstrating that incorporating explanation guidance into sample acquisition yields superior data efficiency while maintaining clinical interpretability.",

It demands faithful content selection, coherent slide organization, layout-aware rendering, and robust multi-turn instruction following. However, existing benchmarks and evaluation protocols do not adequately measure these challenges. To address this gap, we introduce the Deck Edits and Compliance Kit Benchmark (DECKBench), an evaluation framework for multi-agent slide generation and editing. DECKBench is built on a curated dataset of paper to slide pairs augmented with realistic, simulated editing instructions. Our evaluation protocol systematically assesses slide-level and deck-level fidelity, coherence, layout quality, and multi-turn instruction following. We further implement a modular multi-agent baseline system that decomposes the slide generation and editing task into paper parsing and summarization, slide planning, HTML creation, and iterative editing. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed benchmark highlights strengths, exposes failure modes, and provides actionable insights for improving multi-agent slide generation and editing systems.

We introduce FUTON (Fourier Tensor Network), which models signals as generalized Fourier series whose coefficients are parameterized by a low-rank tensor decomposition. FUTON implicitly expresses signals as weighted combinations of orthonormal, separable basis functions, combining complementary inductive biases: Fourier bases capture smoothness and periodicity, while the low-rank parameterization enforces low-dimensional spectral structure. We provide theoretical guarantees through a universal approximation theorem and derive an inference algorithm with complexity linear in the spectral resolution and the input dimension. On image and volume representation, FUTON consistently outperforms state-of-the-art MLP-based INRs while training 2--5$\\times$ faster. On inverse problems such as image denoising and super-resolution, FUTON generalizes better and converges faster.",

        "abstract": "Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models can generate plausible end-effector motions, yet they often fail in long-horizon, contact-rich tasks because the underlying hand-object interaction (HOI) structure is not explicitly represented. An embodiment-agnostic interaction representation that captures this structure would make manipulation behaviors easier to validate and transfer across robots. We propose FlowHOI, a two-stage flow-matching framework that generates semantically grounded, temporally coherent HOI sequences, comprising hand poses, object poses, and hand-object contact states, conditioned on an egocentric observation, a language instruction, and a 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) scene reconstruction. We decouple geometry-centric grasping from semantics-centric manipulation, conditioning the latter on compact 3D scene tokens and employing a motion-text alignment loss to semantically ground the generated interactions in both the physical scene layout and the language instruction. To address the scarcity of high-fidelity HOI supervision, we introduce a reconstruction pipeline that recovers aligned hand-object trajectories and meshes from large-scale egocentric videos, yielding an HOI prior for robust generation. Across the GRAB and HOT3D benchmarks, FlowHOI achieves the highest action recognition accuracy and a 1.7$\\times$ higher physics simulation success rate than the strongest diffusion-based baseline, while delivering a 40$\\times$ inference speedup. We further demonstrate real-robot execution on four dexterous manipulation tasks, illustrating the feasibility of retargeting generated HOI representations to real-robot execution pipelines.",

Nevertheless, in real-world applications, GUI agents are often faced with non-stationary environments, leading to high computational costs for data curation and policy optimization. In this report, we introduce a novel MLLM-centered framework for GUI agents, which consists of two components: agentic-Q estimation and step-wise policy optimization. The former one aims to optimize a Q-model that can generate step-wise values to evaluate the contribution of a given action to task completion. The latter one takes step-wise samples from the state-action trajectory as inputs, and optimizes the policy via reinforcement learning with our agentic-Q model. It should be noticed that (i) all state-action trajectories are produced by the policy itself, so that the data collection costs are manageable; (ii) the policy update is decoupled from the environment, ensuring stable and efficient optimization. Empirical evaluations show that our framework endows Ovis2.5-9B with powerful GUI interaction capabilities, achieving remarkable performances on GUI navigation and grounding benchmarks and even surpassing contenders with larger scales.",

To stabilize tactile embeddings, we further introduce a physics-informed regularization that encourages bilateral force balance, reflecting principles of human motor control. Experiments on the TacSL benchmark show that CMT with symmetry regularization achieves a 96.59% insertion success rate, surpassing naïve and gated fusion baselines and closely matching the privileged \"wrist + contact force\" configuration (96.09%).

We here address three critical challenges in the current SOTA solution: insufficient retrieval granularity, vulnerability to environmental noise, and prohibitive efficiency-performance gap. Our primary contribution lies in two fundamental paradigm shifts. First, we transitioned the embedding paradigm from traditional contrastive learning to an absolute ID-recognition task. Through anchoring instances to a globally consistent latent space defined by billions of semantic prototypes, we successfully overcome the stochasticity and granularity bottlenecks inherent in existing embedding solutions. Second, we evolved the generative reranker from isolated pointwise evaluation to the compare-and-calibrate listwise policy. By synergizing chunk-based comparative reasoning with calibrated absolute relevance scoring, the system achieves nuanced discriminative resolution while circumventing the prohibitive latency typically associated with conventional reranking methods. Extensive offline benchmarks and online A/B tests on Alibaba e-commerce platform confirm that Pailitao-VL achieves state-of-the-art performance and delivers substantial business impact.

        "abstract": "Multimedia Event Extraction (MEE) aims to identify events and their arguments from documents that contain both text and images. It requires grounding event semantics across different modalities. Progress in MEE is limited by the lack of annotated training data. M2E2 is the only established benchmark, but it provides annotations only for evaluation. This makes direct supervised training impractical. Existing methods mainly rely on cross-modal alignment or inference-time prompting with Vision--Language Models (VLMs). These approaches do not explicitly learn structured event representations and often produce weak argument grounding in multimodal settings. To address these limitations, we propose RMPL, a Relation-aware Multi-task Progressive Learning framework for MEE under low-resource conditions. RMPL incorporates heterogeneous supervision from unimodal event extraction and multimedia relation extraction with stage-wise training. The model is first trained with a unified schema to learn shared event-centric representations across modalities. It is then fine-tuned for event mention identification and argument role extraction using mixed textual and visual data. Experiments on the M2E2 benchmark with multiple VLMs show consistent improvements across different modality settings.",

However, existing vision-based methods rely on fixed visual graph layouts, and therefore, the expressiveness of their pipeline is restricted. To overcome this limitation, we propose VSAL, a vision-based framework that incorporates an adaptive layout generator capable of dynamically producing informative graph visualizations tailored to individual instances, thereby improving graph property detection.

Rovers operating on planetary surfaces must navigate under sever environmental constraints, limited visual redundancy, and communication delays, making onboard spatial awareness and visual localization key components for mission success. Traditional techniques based on Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) provide geometric consistency but struggle to capture radiometric detail or to scale efficiently in unstructured, low-texture terrains typical of extraterrestrial environments. This work explores the integration of radiance field-based methods - specifically Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and Gaussian Splatting - into a unified, automated environment reconstruction pipeline for planetary robotics. Our system combines the Nerfstudio and COLMAP frameworks with a ROS2-compatible workflow capable of processing raw rover data directly from rosbag recordings. This approach enables the generation of dense, photorealistic, and metrically consistent 3D representations from minimal visual input, supporting improved perception and planning for autonomous systems operating in planetary-like conditions. The resulting pipeline established a foundation for future research in radiance field-based mapping, bridging the gap between geometric and neural representations in planetary exploration.",

However, most interactive systems remain fundamentally reactive, responding only to current sensory inputs within a short temporal window. Proactive social behavior, in contrast, requires deliberation over accumulated context and intent inference, which conflicts with the strict latency budget of real-time interaction. We present \\emph{ProAct}, a dual-system framework that reconciles this time-scale conflict by decoupling a low-latency \\emph{Behavioral System} for streaming multimodal interaction from a slower \\emph{Cognitive System} which performs long-horizon social reasoning and produces high-level proactive intentions. To translate deliberative intentions into continuous non-verbal behaviors without disrupting fluency, we introduce a streaming flow-matching model conditioned on intentions via ControlNet. This mechanism supports asynchronous intention injection, enabling seamless transitions between reactive and proactive gestures within a single motion stream. We deploy ProAct on a physical humanoid robot and evaluate both motion quality and interactive effectiveness. In real-world interaction user studies, participants and observers consistently prefer ProAct over reactive variants in perceived proactivity, social presence, and overall engagement, demonstrating the benefits of dual-system proactive control for embodied social interaction.",

Electroencephalography (EEG) provides a direct measurement of neural activity, yet EEG-based fatigue recognition is hindered by strong non-stationarity and asymmetric neural dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose DeltaGateNet, a novel framework that explicitly captures Bidirectional temporal dynamics for EEG-based driving fatigue recognition. Our key idea is to introduce a Bidirectional Delta module that decomposes first-order temporal differences into positive and negative components, enabling explicit modeling of asymmetric neural activation and suppression patterns. Furthermore, we design a Gated Temporal Convolution module to capture long-term temporal dependencies for each EEG channel using depthwise temporal convolutions and residual learning, preserving channel-wise specificity while enhancing temporal representation robustness. Extensive experiments conducted under both intra-subject and inter-subject evaluation settings on the public SEED-VIG and SADT driving fatigue datasets demonstrate that DeltaGateNet consistently outperforms existing methods. On SEED-VIG, DeltaGateNet achieves an intra-subject accuracy of 81.89% and an inter-subject accuracy of 55.55%. On the balanced SADT 2022 dataset, it attains intra-subject and inter-subject accuracies of 96.81% and 83.21%, respectively, while on the unbalanced SADT 2952 dataset, it achieves 96.84% intra-subject and 84.49% inter-subject accuracy. These results indicate that explicitly modeling Bidirectional temporal dynamics yields robust and generalizable performance under varying subject and class-distribution conditions.",

Experimental results show that the system achieves a high correspondence between predicted and actual materials on both single- and multi-material objects, with an average matching accuracy of 79.87% across multiple manipulation trials on a multi-material object.",

        "abstract": "Existing multimodal document question answering methods universally adopt a supply-side ingestion strategy: running a Vision-Language Model (VLM) on every page during indexing to generate comprehensive descriptions, then answering questions through text retrieval. However, this \"pre-ingestion\" approach is costly (a 113-page engineering drawing package requires approximately 80,000 VLM tokens), end-to-end unreliable (VLM outputs may fail to be correctly retrieved due to format mismatches in the retrieval infrastructure), and irrecoverable once it fails. This paper proposes the Deferred Visual Ingestion (DVI) framework, adopting a demand-side ingestion strategy: the indexing phase performs only lightweight metadata extraction, deferring visual understanding to the moment users pose specific questions. DVI's core principle is \"Index for locating, not understanding\"--achieving page localization through structured metadata indexes and BM25 full-text search, then sending original images along with specific questions to a VLM for targeted analysis. Experiments on two real industrial engineering drawings (113 pages + 7 pages) demonstrate that DVI achieves comparable overall accuracy at zero ingestion VLM cost (46.7% vs. 48.9%), an effectiveness rate of 50% on visually necessary queries (vs. 0% for pre-ingestion), and 100% page localization (98% search space compression). DVI also supports interactive refinement and progressive caching, transforming the \"QA accuracy\" problem into a \"page localization\" problem--once the correct drawing page is found, obtaining the answer becomes a matter of interaction rounds.",

        "abstract": "Articulated object manipulation is essential for various real-world robotic tasks, yet generalizing across diverse objects remains a major challenge. A key to generalization lies in understanding functional parts (e.g., door handles and knobs), which indicate where and how to manipulate across diverse object categories and shapes. Previous works attempted to achieve generalization by introducing foundation features, while these features are mostly 2D-based and do not specifically consider functional parts. When lifting these 2D features to geometry-profound 3D space, challenges arise, such as long runtimes, multi-view inconsistencies, and low spatial resolution with insufficient geometric information. To address these issues, we propose Part-Aware 3D Feature Field (PA3FF), a novel dense 3D feature with part awareness for generalizable articulated object manipulation. PA3FF is trained by 3D part proposals from a large-scale labeled dataset, via a contrastive learning formulation. Given point clouds as input, PA3FF predicts a continuous 3D feature field in a feedforward manner, where the distance between point features reflects the proximity of functional parts: points with similar features are more likely to belong to the same part. Building on this feature, we introduce the Part-Aware Diffusion Policy (PADP), an imitation learning framework aimed at enhancing sample efficiency and generalization for robotic manipulation. We evaluate PADP on several simulated and real-world tasks, demonstrating that PA3FF consistently outperforms a range of 2D and 3D representations in manipulation scenarios, including CLIP, DINOv2, and Grounded-SAM. Beyond imitation learning, PA3FF enables diverse downstream methods, including correspondence learning and segmentation tasks, making it a versatile foundation for robotic manipulation.

        "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful approach for novel view synthesis. However, the number of Gaussian primitives often grows substantially during training as finer scene details are reconstructed, leading to increased memory and storage costs. Recent coarse-to-fine strategies regulate Gaussian growth by modulating the frequency content of the ground-truth images. In particular, AutoOpti3DGS employs the learnable Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to enable data-adaptive frequency modulation. Nevertheless, its modulation depth is limited by the 1-level DWT, and jointly optimizing wavelet regularization with 3D reconstruction introduces gradient competition that promotes excessive Gaussian densification. In this paper, we propose a multi-level DWT-based frequency modulation framework for 3DGS. By recursively decomposing the low-frequency subband, we construct a deeper curriculum that provides progressively coarser supervision during early training, consistently reducing Gaussian counts. Furthermore, we show that the modulation can be performed using only a single scaling parameter, rather than learning the full 2-tap high-pass filter. Experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method further reduces Gaussian counts while maintaining competitive rendering quality.",

As Large Language Models (LLMs) general capabilities rapidly evolve and the proliferation of agentic AI, this version of the risk analysis technical report presents an updated and granular assessment of five critical dimensions: cyber offense, persuasion and manipulation, strategic deception, uncontrolled AI R\\&D, and self-replication. Specifically, we introduce more complex scenarios for cyber offense. For persuasion and manipulation, we evaluate the risk of LLM-to-LLM persuasion on newly released LLMs. For strategic deception and scheming, we add the new experiment with respect to emergent misalignment. For uncontrolled AI R\\&D, we focus on the ``mis-evolution'' of agents as they autonomously expand their memory substrates and toolsets. Besides, we also monitor and evaluate the safety performance of OpenClaw during the interaction on the Moltbook. For self-replication, we introduce a new resource-constrained scenario. More importantly, we propose and validate a series of robust mitigation strategies to address these emerging threats, providing a preliminary technical and actionable pathway for the secure deployment of frontier AI.

We show that the existing metrics used to measure representational similarity are confounded by network scale: increasing model depth or width can systematically inflate representational similarity scores. To correct these effects, we introduce a permutation-based null-calibration framework that transforms any representational similarity metric into a calibrated score with statistical guarantees. We revisit the Platonic Representation Hypothesis with our calibration framework, which reveals a nuanced picture: the apparent convergence reported by global spectral measures largely disappears after calibration, while local neighborhood similarity, but not local distances, retains significant agreement across different modalities. Based on these findings, we propose the Aristotelian Representation Hypothesis: representations in neural networks are converging to shared local neighborhood relationships.",

Beyond sample quality, an important yet less systematically studied question is whether trained generative models faithfully capture the diversity of the underlying data distribution. In this work, we address this question by directly comparing the diversity of samples generated by state-of-the-art models with that of test samples drawn from the target data distribution, using recently proposed reference-free entropy-based diversity scores, Vendi and RKE. Across multiple benchmark datasets, we find that test data consistently attains substantially higher Vendi and RKE diversity scores than the generated samples, suggesting a systematic downward diversity bias in modern generative models. To understand the origin of this bias, we analyze the finite-sample behavior of entropy-based diversity scores and show that their expected values increase with sample size, implying that diversity estimated from finite training sets could inherently underestimate the diversity of the true distribution. As a result, optimizing the generators to minimize divergence to empirical data distributions would induce a loss of diversity. Finally, we discuss potential diversity-aware regularization and guidance strategies based on Vendi and RKE as principled directions for mitigating this bias, and provide empirical evidence suggesting their potential to improve the results.",

        "abstract": "Current meta-learning methods are constrained to narrow task distributions with fixed feature and label spaces, limiting applicability. Moreover, the current meta-learning literature uses key terms like \"universal\" and \"general-purpose\" inconsistently and lacks precise definitions, hindering comparability. We introduce a theoretical framework for meta-learning which formally defines practical universality and introduces a distinction between algorithm-explicit and algorithm-implicit learning, providing a principled vocabulary for reasoning about universal meta-learning methods. Guided by this framework, we present TAIL, a transformer-based algorithm-implicit meta-learner that functions across tasks with varying domains, modalities, and label configurations. TAIL features three innovations over prior transformer-based meta-learners: random projections for cross-modal feature encoding, random injection label embeddings that extrapolate to larger label spaces, and efficient inline query processing. TAIL achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard few-shot benchmarks while generalizing to unseen domains. Unlike other meta-learning methods, it also generalizes to unseen modalities, solving text classification tasks despite training exclusively on images, handles tasks with up to 20$\\times$ more classes than seen during training, and provides orders-of-magnitude computational savings over prior transformer-based approaches.",

        "abstract": "Task-specialized models form the backbone of agentic healthcare systems, enabling the agents to answer clinical queries across tasks such as disease diagnosis, localization, and report generation. Yet, for a given task, a single \"best\" model rarely exists. In practice, each task is better served by multiple competing specialist models where different models excel on different data samples. As a result, for any given query, agents must reliably select the right specialist model from a heterogeneous pool of tool candidates. To this end, we introduce ToolSelect, which adaptively learns model selection for tools by minimizing a population risk over sampled specialist tool candidates using a consistent surrogate of the task-conditional selection loss. Concretely, we propose an Attentive Neural Process-based selector conditioned on the query and per-model behavioral summaries to choose among the specialist models. Motivated by the absence of any established testbed, we, for the first time, introduce an agentic Chest X-ray environment equipped with a diverse suite of task-specialized models (17 disease detection, 19 report generation, 6 visual grounding, and 13 VQA) and develop ToolSelectBench, a benchmark of 1448 queries. Our results demonstrate that ToolSelect consistently outperforms 10 SOTA methods across four different task families.",

It can also simulate agile dynamics of multi-rotor vehicles in complex and dynamic environments. Neurosim can achieve frame rates as high as ~2700 FPS on a desktop GPU. Neurosim integrates with a ZeroMQ-based communication library called Cortex to facilitate seamless integration with machine learning and robotics workflows. Cortex provides a high-throughput, low-latency message-passing system for Python and C++ applications, with native support for NumPy arrays and PyTorch tensors. This paper discusses the design philosophy behind Neurosim and Cortex. It demonstrates how they can be used to (i) train neuromorphic perception and control algorithms, e.g., using self-supervised learning on time-synchronized multi-modal data, and (ii) test real-time implementations of these algorithms in closed-loop.
