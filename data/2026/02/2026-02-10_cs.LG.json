        "abstract": "Transformers achieve strong language modeling accuracy, yet their position-wise feed-forward networks (FFNs) are dense, globally shared, and typically updated end to end. These properties create two practical tensions. First, dense FFNs spend the same compute on every token regardless of context, and they allocate capacity uniformly even when language exhibits highly clustered context structure. Second, continual learning, in the sense of updating the model while serving a data stream, often produces interference because a small update touches broadly shared weights. We propose Attractor Patch Networks (APN), a plug-compatible replacement for the Transformer FFN. APN is a bank of patch experts. A similarity router selects a small top-k set of patches for each token by matching the token representation to learned prototypes. Each selected patch emits a low-rank residual update conditioned on a compact code. The architecture yields conditional, context-specialized nonlinear transformations while preserving the standard Transformer interface. This paper focuses on APN as an architectural primitive. We formalize APN, analyze its expressivity as a piecewise low-rank residual function class, and derive simple interference and stability arguments that make APN naturally compatible with continual learning. In experiments on character-level language modeling, APN achieves competitive perplexity (4.57 vs 4.32 PPL) while enabling dramatically better continual adaptation: when adapting to a shifted domain, APN achieves 2.6 times better retention (11.1 vs 29.4 PPL on the original domain) and 2.8 times better adaptation (6.4 vs 17.8 PPL on the new domain) compared to global fine-tuning of a dense FFN baseline.",

In this work, we present Neural Sabermetrics with World Model, a Large Language Model (LLM) based play-by-play world model for baseball. We cast baseball games as long auto-regressive sequences of events and continuously pretrain a single LLM on more than ten years of Major League Baseball (MLB) tracking data, comprising over seven million pitch sequences and approximately three billion tokens. The resulting model is capable of predicting multiple aspects of game evolution within a unified framework. We evaluate our model on both in-distribution regular-season data and out-of-distribution postseason games and compare against strong neural baselines from prior work. Despite using a single backbone model, our approach outperforms the performance of existing baselines, (1) correctly predicting approximately 64% of next pitches within a plate appearance and (2) 78% of batter swing decisions, suggesting that LLMs can serve as effective world models for sports.",

Generative AI has shown promise in increasing data volume and enhancing model training, particularly in computer vision and natural language processing (NLP) domains. However, generating physiological time-series data, a common type in medical AI applications, presents unique challenges due to its inherent complexity and variability. This paper introduces TransConv-DDPM, an enhanced generative AI method for biomechanical and physiological time-series data generation. The model employs a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) with U-Net, multi-scale convolution modules, and a transformer layer to capture both global and local temporal dependencies. We evaluated TransConv-DDPM on three diverse datasets, generating both long and short-sequence time-series data. Quantitative comparisons against state-of-the-art methods, TimeGAN and Diffusion-TS, using four performance metrics, demonstrated promising results, particularly on the SmartFallMM and EEG datasets, where it effectively captured the more gradual temporal change patterns between data points. Additionally, a utility test on the SmartFallMM dataset revealed that adding synthetic fall data generated by TransConv-DDPM improved predictive model performance, showing a 13.64% improvement in F1-score and a 14.93% increase in overall accuracy compared to the baseline model trained solely on fall data from the SmartFallMM dataset. These findings highlight the potential of TransConv-DDPM to generate high-quality synthetic data for real-world applications.",

Unlike language-based reasoning systems, TACIT operates entirely in pixel space using rectified flow, enabling direct visualization of the reasoning process at each inference step. We demonstrate the approach on maze-solving, where the model learns to transform images of unsolved mazes into solutions. Key results on 1 million synthetic maze pairs include: - 192x reduction in training loss over 100 epochs - 22.7x improvement in L2 distance to ground truth - Only 10 Euler steps required (vs. 100-1000 for typical diffusion models) Quantitative analysis reveals a striking phase transition phenomenon: the solution remains invisible for 68% of the transformation (zero recall), then emerges abruptly at t=0.70 within just 2% of the process. Most remarkably, 100% of samples exhibit simultaneous emergence across all spatial regions, ruling out sequential path construction and providing evidence for holistic rather than algorithmic reasoning. This \"eureka moment\" pattern -- long incubation followed by sudden crystallization -- parallels insight phenomena in human cognition. The pixel-space design with noise-free flow matching provides a foundation for understanding how neural networks develop implicit reasoning strategies that operate below and before language.",

We argue that this formulation is inefficient and lacks the structural inductive bias necessary for distinguishing between local feature preservation and global context integration. To address this, we introduce the Hybrid Dual-Path Linear (HDPL) operator, which decomposes the affine transformation into two topologically distinct pathways: a sparse block-diagonal component for high-rank local processing, and a low-rank Variational Autoencoder (VAE) bottleneck for global context regularization. By \"surgically\" replacing specific projections (Query, Key, Value, Gate, Up) with HDPL operators while retaining standard dense layers for aggregation (Output, Down), we achieve a superior balance of efficiency and representational power. Experiments on the FineWeb-Edu dataset demonstrate that the HDPL architecture outperforms a standard Llama-style baseline, reducing validation loss while simultaneously reducing parameter count by 6.8%. Beyond immediate performance gains, we discuss how the explicit materialization of a probabilistic latent space within the Transformer backbone serves as a vital architectural affordance, offering new pathways for inference-time or hypernetwork induced control, continual adaptation, interpretability, and cross-model or cross-modal synchronization.

Despite significant advances in deep learning based registration methods, accurately aligning images with large deformations while preserving anatomical plausibility remains a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a novel Attention-Driven Framework for Non-Rigid Medical Image Registration (AD-RegNet) that employs attention mechanisms to guide the registration process. Our approach combines a 3D UNet backbone with bidirectional cross-attention, which establishes correspondences between moving and fixed images at multiple scales. We introduce a regional adaptive attention mechanism that focuses on anatomically relevant structures, along with a multi-resolution deformation field synthesis approach for accurate alignment. The method is evaluated on two distinct datasets: DIRLab for thoracic 4D CT scans and IXI for brain MRI scans, demonstrating its versatility across different anatomical structures and imaging modalities. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art methods on the IXI and DIRLab datasets. The proposed method maintains a favorable balance between registration accuracy and computational efficiency, making it suitable for clinical applications. A comprehensive evaluation using normalized cross-correlation (NCC), mean squared error (MSE), structural similarity (SSIM), Jacobian determinant, and target registration error (TRE) indicates that attention-guided registration improves alignment accuracy while ensuring anatomically plausible deformations.",

While substantial progress has been made in single-table synthetic generation where data are modeled at the row or item level, most real-world data exists in relational databases where a user's information spans items across multiple interconnected tables. Recent advances in synthetic relational data generation have emerged to address this complexity, yet release of these data introduce unique privacy challenges as information can be leaked not only from individual items but also through the relationships that comprise a complete user entity. To address this, we propose a novel Membership Inference Attack (MIA) setting to audit the empirical user-level privacy of synthetic relational data and show that single-table MIAs that audit at an item level underestimate user-level privacy leakage. We then propose Multi-Table Membership Inference Attack (MT-MIA), a novel adversarial attack under a No-Box threat model that targets learned representations of user entities via Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks. By incorporating all connected items for a user, MT-MIA better targets user-level vulnerabilities induced by inter-tabular relationships than existing attacks. We evaluate MT-MIA on a range of real-world multi-table datasets and demonstrate that this vulnerability exists in state-of-the-art relational synthetic data generators, employing MT-MIA to additionally study where this leakage occurs.",

Many modern learning models, however -- including fixed-architecture neural networks equipped with non-quadratic norms -- naturally give rise to non-Hilbertian geometries that fall outside this setting. In Banach spaces, continuity of point-evaluation functionals alone is insufficient to guarantee feature representations or kernel-based learning formulations. In this work, we develop a functional-analytic framework for learning in Banach spaces based on the notion of featured reproducing kernel Banach spaces. We identify the precise structural conditions under which feature maps, kernel constructions, and representer-type results can be recovered beyond the Hilbertian regime. Within this framework, supervised learning is formulated as a minimal-norm interpolation or regularization problem, and existence results together with conditional representer theorems are established. We further extend the theory to vector-valued featured reproducing kernel Banach spaces and show that fixed-architecture neural networks naturally induce special instances of such spaces. This provides a unified function-space perspective on kernel methods and neural networks and clarifies when kernel-based learning principles extend beyond reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces.",

We illustrate that deep learning quickly becomes weakly convex after a short period of training, and the loss is predicable by an upper bound on the last iterate, which further informs the scaling of optimal learning rate. Through the lens of convexity, we build scaling laws of learning rates and losses that extrapolate as much as 80X across training horizons and 70X across model sizes.",

The double robustness and the propensity score matching for the inclusion of data domains make matching more robust than naive pooling and uniform subsampling by filtering out the confounding domains (the main cause of heterogeneity). Theoretical and empirical analyses show that, unlike naive pooling or uniform subsampling, matching achieves better results under asymmetric meta-distributions, which are also extended to non-Gaussian and multimodal real-world settings.

        "abstract": "LLMs have shown strong in-context learning (ICL) abilities, but have not yet been extended to signal processing systems. Inspired by their design, we have proposed for the first time ICL using transformer models applicable to motor feedforward control, a critical task where classical PI and physics-based methods struggle with nonlinearities and complex load conditions. We propose a transformer based model architecture that separates signal representation from system behavior, enabling both few-shot finetuning and one-shot ICL. Pretrained on a large corpus of synthetic linear and nonlinear systems, the model learns to generalize to unseen system dynamics of real-world motors only with a handful of examples. In experiments, our approach generalizes across multiple motor load configurations, transforms untuned examples into accurate feedforward predictions, and outperforms PI controllers and physics-based feedforward baselines. These results demonstrate that ICL can bridge synthetic pretraining and real-world adaptability, opening new directions for data efficient control of physical systems.",

A key advantage of these models is that they can be trained exclusively on linear elastic data and then generalized to nonlinear inelastic regimes during online prediction. Despite their growing adoption, systematic evaluations of their performance across the full offline-online pipeline remain limited. This work presents a comprehensive comparative assessment of DMNs with respect to prediction accuracy, computational efficiency, and training robustness. We investigate the effects of offline training choices, including initialization, batch size, training data size, and activation regularization on online generalization performance and uncertainty. The results demonstrate that both prediction error and variance decrease with increasing training data size, while initialization and batch size can significantly influence model performance. Moreover, activation regularization is shown to play a critical role in controlling network complexity and therefore generalization performance. Compared with the original DMN, the rotation-free Interaction-based Material Network (IMN) formulation achieves a 3.4x - 4.7x speed-up in offline training, while maintaining comparable online prediction accuracy and computational efficiency. These findings clarify key trade-offs between model expressivity and efficiency in structure-preserving material networks and provide practical guidance for their deployment in multiscale material modeling.",

However, safety concerns remain when these methods are deployed on real-world applications, necessitating risk-aware agents. A common utility for learning such risk-aware agents is the entropic risk measure, but current policy gradient methods optimizing this measure must perform high-variance and numerically unstable updates. As a result, existing risk-sensitive model-free approaches are limited to simple tasks and tabular settings. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive theoretical justification for policy gradient methods on the entropic risk measure, including on- and off-policy gradient theorems for the stochastic and deterministic policy settings. Motivated by theory, we propose risk-sensitive exponential actor-critic (rsEAC), an off-policy model-free approach that incorporates novel procedures to avoid the explicit representation of exponential value functions and their gradients, and optimizes its policy w.r.t the entropic risk measure. We show that rsEAC produces more numerically stable updates compared to existing approaches and reliably learns risk-sensitive policies in challenging risky variants of continuous tasks in MuJoCo.",

        "abstract": "We study online learning in two-player uninformed Markov games, where the opponent's actions and policies are unobserved. In this setting, Tian et al. (2021) show that achieving no-external-regret is impossible without incurring an exponential dependence on the episode length $H$. They then turn to the weaker notion of Nash-value regret and propose a V-learning algorithm with regret $O(K^{2/3})$ after $K$ episodes. However, their algorithm and guarantee do not adapt to the difficulty of the problem: even in the case where the opponent follows a fixed policy and thus $O(\\sqrt{K})$ external regret is well-known to be achievable, their result is still the worse rate $O(K^{2/3})$ on a weaker metric. In this work, we fully address both limitations. First, we introduce empirical Nash-value regret, a new regret notion that is strictly stronger than Nash-value regret and naturally reduces to external regret when the opponent follows a fixed policy. Moreover, under this new metric, we propose a parameter-free algorithm that achieves an $O(\\min \\{\\sqrt{K} + (CK)^{1/3},\\sqrt{LK}\\})$ regret bound, where $C$ quantifies the variance of the opponent's policies and $L$ denotes the number of policy switches (both at most $O(K)$). Therefore, our results not only recover the two extremes -- $O(\\sqrt{K})$ external regret when the opponent is fixed and $O(K^{2/3})$ Nash-value regret in the worst case -- but also smoothly interpolate between these extremes by automatically adapting to the opponent's non-stationarity. We achieve so by first providing a new analysis of the epoch-based V-learning algorithm by Mao et al. (2022), establishing an $O(\\eta C + \\sqrt{K/\\eta})$ regret bound, where $\\eta$ is the epoch incremental factor. Next, we show how to adaptively restart this algorithm with an appropriate $\\eta$ in response to the potential non-stationarity of the opponent, eventually achieving our final results.",

This work explores a fundamental principle for enhancing generative models: treating retrieval as a form of dynamic in-context learning. We test an adaptive retrieval-augmented architecture where an LLM agent actively decides when to query an external knowledge base during its reasoning process. We compare this adaptive strategy against a standard Chain-of-Thought (CoT) baseline and a static retrieval approach on the GSM8K and MATH-500 benchmarks. Although our experiments show that static retrieval is inferior to CoT, the adaptive retrieval shows interesting behavior: While traces including retrieved results show slightly worse performance compared to CoT, traces that do not include retrieval actually perform better compared to CoT. This suggests that: (a) retrieval only rarely helps reasoning (we show a few counterexamples, e.g. using useful theorems) and (b) actively not using retrieval is indicative of good model performance. Furthermore, we find that the model scales its retrieval frequency with the difficulty of the problem, reinforcing that the decision to retrieve is a crucial metacognitive signal. The agent's ability to self-assess its knowledge and selectively engage with external information represents a key principle for building more robust and reliable generative models.",

We ask whether, beyond producing good tours, a trained TSP solver learns internal representations that transfer to other optimization-relevant objectives, in the spirit of transfer learning from other domains. We train several attention-based TSP policies, collect their internal activations, and train probes on node/edge embeddings for two NP-hard prescriptive downstream tasks inspired by real-world logistics scenarios: node-removal sensitivity (identifying the most impactful node to remove) and edge-forbid sensitivity (identifying the most critical edge to retain). On a Euclidean TSP100-trained model, probes for both tasks are competitive with existing baselines. Ensembling probe signals with geometric features outperforms the strongest baselines: 65\\% top-1 accuracy (vs. 58\\% baseline) for the best-node-removal task, and 73\\% top-1 accuracy (vs. 67\\% baseline) for the worst-edge identification task. To our knowledge, we are the first to study neural TSP solvers as transferable encoders for prescriptive what-if decision-support objectives beyond tour construction. Finally, we show that transfer accuracy increases with solver quality across training and model scale, suggesting that training stronger NCO solvers also yields more useful encoders for downstream objectives.

Previous works have shown that self-speculative decoding with sparse attention, where tokens are drafted using a subset of the KV cache and verified in parallel with full KV cache, speeds up inference in a lossless way. However, this approach relies on standalone KV selection algorithms to select the KV entries used for drafting and overlooks that the criticality of each KV entry is inherently computed during verification. In this paper, we propose SpecAttn, a self-speculative decoding method with verification-guided sparse attention. SpecAttn identifies critical KV entries as a byproduct of verification and only loads these entries when drafting subsequent tokens. This not only improves draft token acceptance rate but also incurs low KV selection overhead, thereby improving decoding throughput.

This motivates the development of sample-efficient performance estimators, which aim to estimate model performance by strategically selecting instances for labeling, thereby reducing annotation cost. Yet existing evaluation approaches often fail in low-variance settings: RMSE conflates bias and variance, masking persistent bias when variance is small, while p-value based tests become hypersensitive, rejecting adequate estimators for negligible deviations. To address this, we propose a fault-tolerant evaluation framework that integrates bias and variance considerations within an adjustable tolerance level ${\\varepsilon}$, enabling the evaluation of performance estimators within practically acceptable error margins. We theoretically show that proper calibration of ${\\varepsilon}$ ensures reliable evaluation across different variance regimes, and we further propose an algorithm that automatically optimizes and selects ${\\varepsilon}$.

However, existing GNNs often struggle with heterophilic graphs, where connected nodes tend to have dissimilar features or labels. While numerous methods have been proposed to address this challenge, they primarily focus on architectural designs without directly targeting the root cause of the heterophily problem. These approaches still perform even worse than the simplest MLPs on challenging heterophilic datasets. For instance, our experiments show that 21 latest GNNs still fall behind the MLP on the Actor dataset. This critical challenge calls for an innovative approach to addressing graph heterophily beyond architectural designs. To bridge this gap, we propose and study a new and unexplored paradigm: directly increasing the graph homophily via a carefully designed graph transformation. In this work, we present a simple yet effective framework called GRAPHITE to address graph heterophily. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first method that explicitly transforms the graph to directly improve the graph homophily. Stemmed from the exact definition of homophily, our proposed GRAPHITE creates feature nodes to facilitate homophilic message passing between nodes that share similar features. Furthermore, we both theoretically and empirically show that our proposed GRAPHITE significantly increases the homophily of originally heterophilic graphs, with only a slight increase in the graph size. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets demonstrate that our proposed GRAPHITE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on heterophilic graphs while achieving comparable accuracy with state-of-the-art methods on homophilic graphs.",

Methods: We propose the Dorfman screening framework, a multi-stage procedure that forms data-driven variable groups via hierarchical clustering, performs group and within-group hypothesis testing, and refines selection using elastic net or adaptive elastic net. Robust variants incorporate OGK-based covariance estimation, rank-based correlation, and Huber-weighted regression to handle contaminated and non-normal data. Results: In simulations, Dorfman-Sparse-Adaptive-EN performed best under normal conditions, while Robust-OGK-Dorfman-Adaptive-EN showed clear advantages under data contamination, outperforming classical Dorfman and competing methods. Applied to NSCLC gene expression data for trametinib response, robust Dorfman methods achieved the lowest prediction errors and enriched recovery of clinically relevant genes. Conclusions: The Dorfman framework provides an efficient and robust approach to genomic feature selection. Robust-OGK-Dorfman-Adaptive-EN offers strong performance under both ideal and contaminated conditions and scales to ultra-high-dimensional settings, making it well suited for modern genomic biomarker discovery.",

While recent advances enable batching (co-locating) multiple adapters during serving, efficient training-time co-location of heterogeneous LoRA adapters presents unique challenges. Jobs often differ in adapter rank, batch size, and resource allocation, and naïve batching can introduce synchronization stalls, communication overheads, and per-job slowdowns that are worse than executing independently. We introduce tLoRA, a framework that enables efficient batch training of multiple LoRA jobs. tLoRA fuses adapters that share the same base model into an elastic shared super-model, exploiting existing distributed training frameworks to derive parallelism plans that share resources effectively. At the kernel level, tLoRA employs a fused LoRA kernel that adaptively reconstructs low-rank computation tiles and schedules rank-aware nano-batches to maximize overlap between computation and communication across adapters. At the scheduling layer, tLoRA incorporates an online, residual-capacity-aware scheduler that adaptively groups jobs to maximize collective throughput. Evaluations using real-world cluster traces demonstrate that tLoRA improves training throughput by 1.2--1.8x, job training completion time by 2.3--5.4x, and GPU utilization by 37%.",

To meet these requirements, an edge server must render panoramic content, predict user head motion, and transmit a portion of the scene that is large enough to cover the user viewport while remaining within wireless bandwidth constraints. Each portion produces two feedback signals: prediction feedback, indicating whether the selected portion covers the actual viewport, and transmission feedback, indicating whether the corresponding packets are successfully delivered. Prior work models this problem as a multi-armed bandit with two-level bandit feedback, but fails to exploit the fact that prediction feedback can be retrospectively computed for all candidate portions once the user head pose is observed. As a result, prediction feedback constitutes full-information feedback rather than bandit feedback. Motivated by this observation, we introduce a two-level hybrid feedback model that combines full-information and bandit feedback, and formulate the portion selection problem as an online learning task under this setting. We derive an instance-dependent regret lower bound for the hybrid feedback model and propose AdaPort, a hybrid learning algorithm that leverages both feedback types to improve learning efficiency. We further establish an instance-dependent regret upper bound that matches the lower bound asymptotically, and demonstrate through real-world trace driven simulations that AdaPort consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods.",

While thresholding scores is Bayes-optimal in the unconstrained setting, using a single threshold generally violates statistical group fairness constraints. Under independence (statistical parity) and separation (equalized odds), such thresholding suffices when the scores already satisfy the corresponding criterion. However, this does not extend to sufficiency: even perfectly group-calibrated scores -- including true class probabilities -- violate predictive parity after thresholding. In this work, we present an exact solution for optimal binary (randomized) classification under sufficiency, assuming finite sets of group-calibrated scores. We provide a geometric characterization of the feasible pairs of positive predictive value (PPV) and false omission rate (FOR) achievable by such classifiers, and use it to derive a simple post-processing algorithm that attains the optimal classifier using only group-calibrated scores and group membership. Finally, since sufficiency and separation are generally incompatible, we identify the classifier that minimizes deviation from separation subject to sufficiency, and show that it can also be obtained by our algorithm, often achieving performance comparable to the optimum.",

A closely related but distinct problem is training models that are robust to internal perturbations to their weights, which may be an important need for future low-power hardware platforms. In this paper, we explore the usage of two methods, sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) and random-weight perturbation (RWP), to find minima robust to a variety of random corruptions to weights. We consider the problem from two angles: generalization (how do we reduce the noise-robust generalization gap) and optimization (how do we maximize performance from optimizers when subject to strong perturbations). First, we establish, both theoretically and empirically, that an over-regularized RWP training objective is optimal for noise-robust generalization. For small-magnitude noise, we find that SAM's adversarial objective further improves performance over any RWP configuration, but performs poorly for large-magnitude noise. We link the cause of this to a vanishing-gradient effect, caused by unevenness in the loss landscape, affecting both SAM and RWP. Lastly, we demonstrate that dynamically adjusting the perturbation strength to match the evolution of the loss landscape improves optimizing for these perturbed objectives.",

In this work, we revisit robustness for LLM safety alignment from an optimization geometry perspective, and argue that robustness failures cannot be addressed by data-centric methods alone. We propose ShaPO, a geometry-aware preference optimization framework that enforces worst-case alignment objectives via selective geometry control over alignment-critical parameter subspace. By avoiding uniform geometry constraints, ShaPO mitigates the over-regularization that can harm robustness under distribution shift. We instantiate ShaPO at two levels: token-level ShaPO stabilizes likelihood-based surrogate optimization, while reward-level ShaPO enforces reward-consistent optimization under noisy supervision. Across diverse safety benchmarks and noisy preference settings, ShaPO consistently improves safety robustness over popular preference optimization methods. Moreover, ShaPO composes cleanly with data-robust objectives, yielding additional gains and empirically supporting the proposed optimization-geometry perspective.",

In such a system, we present a unified framework to address the general manipulation task problem. Specifically, the proposed method consists of two phases: i) In the first phase for pretraining, the policy is created in a behavior cloning (BC) manner, through leveraging the learning data from our AR-based remote human-robot interaction system; ii) In the second phase, a contrastive learning empowered reinforcement learning (RL) method is developed to obtain more efficient and robust policy than the BC, and thus a projection head is designed to accelerate the learning progress. An event-driven augmented reward is adopted for enhancing the safety. To validate the proposed method, both the physics simulations via PyBullet and real-world experiments are carried out. The results demonstrate that compared to the classic proximal policy optimization and soft actor-critic policies, our method not only significantly speeds up the inference, but also achieves much better performance in terms of the success rate for fulfilling the manipulation tasks. By conducting the ablation study, it is confirmed that the proposed RL with contrastive learning overcomes policy collapse. Supplementary demonstrations are available at this https URL.",

However, existing steering-based alignment methods suffer from limited controllability: steering a target value often unintentionally activates other, non-target values. To characterize this limitation, we introduce value leakage, a diagnostic notion that captures the unintended activation of non-target values during value steering, along with a normalized leakage metric grounded in Schwartz's value theory. In light of this analysis, we propose NeVA, a neuron-level editing framework for controllable value alignment in LLMs. NeVA identifies sparse, value-relevant neurons and performs inference-time activation editing, enabling fine-grained control without parameter updates or retraining. Experiments show that NeVA achieves stronger target value alignment while incurring smaller performance degradation on general capability. Moreover, NeVA significantly reduces the average leakage, with residual effects largely confined to semantically related value classes. Overall, NeVA offers a more controllable and interpretable mechanism for value alignment.",

In particular, a concept of feature unlearning, in which a neural network progressively loses previously learned features over long training, has gained attention. In this study, we consider the infinite-width limit of a two-layer neural network updated with a large-batch stochastic gradient, then derive differential equations with different time scales, revealing the mechanism and conditions for feature unlearning to occur. Specifically, we utilize the fast-slow dynamics: while an alignment of first-layer weights develops rapidly, the second-layer weights develop slowly. The direction of a flow on a critical manifold, determined by the slow dynamics, decides whether feature unlearning occurs. We give numerical validation of the result, and derive theoretical grounding and scaling laws of the feature unlearning. Our results yield the following insights: (i) the strength of the primary nonlinear term in data induces the feature unlearning, and (ii) an initial scale of the second-layer weights mitigates the feature unlearning. Technically, our analysis utilizes Tensor Programs and the singular perturbation theory.",

To address this challenge, we introduce Sketch&Walk Attention, a training-free sparse attention method that determines sparsity with lightweight sketches and deterministic walk. Sketch&Walk applies Hadamard sketching to get inexpensive approximations of attention scores, then aggregates these estimates across layers via a walk mechanism that captures attention influence beyond direct interactions between tokens. The accumulated walk scores are used to select top-k attention blocks, enabling dynamic sparsity with a single training-free algorithm that applies uniformly to both the prefill and decode phases, together with custom sparse attention kernels. Across a wide range of models and tasks, Sketch&Walk maintains near-lossless accuracy at 20% attention density and can slightly outperform dense attention in some settings, while achieving up to 6x inference speedup.",

We present BitLogic, a fully gradient-based, end-to-end trainable framework for FPGA-native neural networks built around Lookup Table (LUT) computation. BitLogic replaces multiply-accumulate operations with differentiable LUT nodes that map directly to FPGA primitives, enabling native binary computation, sparse connectivity, and efficient hardware realization. The framework offers a modular functional API supporting diverse architectures, along with learned encoders, hardware-aware heads, and multiple boundary-consistent LUT relaxations. An automated Register Transfer Level (RTL) export pipeline translates trained PyTorch models into synthesizable HDL, ensuring equivalence between software and hardware inference. Experiments across standard vision benchmarks and heterogeneous hardware platforms demonstrate competitive accuracy and substantial gains in FPGA efficiency, including 72.3% test accuracy on CIFAR-10 achieved with fewer than 0.3M logic gates, while attaining sub-20 ns single-sample inference using only LUT resources.",

We propose the first BO algorithm that achieves no-regret guarantee in a general reward setting, requiring only Lipschitz continuity of the objective function and accommodating a broad class of measurement noise. The core of our approach is a novel surrogate model, termed as infinite Gaussian process ($\\infty$-GP). It is a Bayesian nonparametric model that places a prior on the space of reward distributions, enabling it to represent a substantially broader class of reward models than classical Gaussian process (GP). The $\\infty$-GP is used in combination with Thompson Sampling (TS) to enable effective exploration and exploitation. Correspondingly, we develop a new TS regret analysis framework for general rewards, which relates the regret to the total variation distance between the surrogate model and the true reward distribution. Furthermore, with a truncated Gibbs sampling procedure, our method is computationally scalable, incurring minimal additional memory and computational complexities compared to classical GP. Empirical results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, particularly in settings with non-stationary, heavy-tailed, or other ill-conditioned rewards.",

Capturing chirality in machine learning models remains challenging due to the geometric complexity of stereochemical relationships and the limitations of traditional molecular representations that often lack explicit stereochemical encoding. Existing approaches to chiral molecular representation primarily focus on central chirality, relying on handcrafted stereochemical tags or limited 3D encodings, and thus fail to generalize to more complex forms such as axial chirality. In this work, we introduce ChiDeK (Chiral Determinant Kernels), a framework that systematically integrates stereogenic information into molecular representation learning. We propose the chiral determinant kernel to encode the SE(3)-invariant chirality matrix and employ cross-attention to integrate stereochemical information from local chiral centers into the global molecular representation. This design enables explicit modeling of chiral-related features within a unified architecture, capable of jointly encoding central and axial chirality. To support the evaluation of axial chirality, we construct a new benchmark for electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and optical rotation (OR) prediction. Across four tasks, including R/S configuration classification, enantiomer ranking, ECD spectrum prediction, and OR prediction, ChiDeK achieves substantial improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, most notably yielding over 7% higher accuracy on axially chiral tasks on average.",

While optimal algorithms are known for each measure individually, there is no known algorithm achieving optimal bounds for both simultaneously. Marinov and Zimmert [2021] first showed that such simultaneous optimality is impossible against an adaptive adversary. Our work takes a first step to demonstrate its possibility against an oblivious adversary when losses are deterministic. First, we extend the impossibility result of Marinov and Zimmert [2021] to the case of deterministic losses. Then, we present an algorithm achieving optimal static and dynamic regret simultaneously against an oblivious adversary. Together, they reveal a fundamental separation between adaptive and oblivious adversaries when multiple regret benchmarks are considered simultaneously. It also provides new insight into the long open problem of simultaneously achieving optimal regret against switching benchmarks of different numbers of switches. Our algorithm uses negative static regret to compensate for the exploration overhead incurred when controlling dynamic regret, and leverages Blackwell approachability to jointly control both regrets. This yields a new model selection procedure for bandits that may be of independent interest.",

However, a theoretical understanding of why sign-based updates outperform variance-adapted methods remains elusive. In this paper, we aim to bridge the gap between theory and practice through the lens of heavy-tailed gradient noise, a phenomenon frequently observed in language modeling tasks. Theoretically, we introduce a novel generalized heavy-tailed noise condition that captures the behavior of LLMs more accurately than standard finite variance assumptions. Under this noise model, we establish sharp convergence rates of SignSGD and Lion for generalized smooth function classes, matching or surpassing previous best-known bounds. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to Muon and Muonlight, providing what is, to our knowledge, the first rigorous analysis of matrix optimization under heavy-tailed stochasticity. These results offer a strong theoretical justification for the empirical superiority of sign-based optimizers, showcasing that they are naturally suited to handle the noisy gradients associated with heavy tails. Empirically, LLM pretraining experiments validate our theoretical insights and confirm that our proposed noise models are well-aligned with practice.",

To bridge this gap, we introduce Brep2Shape, a novel self-supervised pre-training method designed to align abstract boundary representations with intuitive shape representations. Our method employs a geometry-aware task where the model learns to predict dense spatial points from parametric Bézier control points, enabling the network to better understand physical manifolds derived from abstract coefficients. To enhance this alignment, we propose a Dual Transformer backbone with parallel streams that independently encode surface and curve tokens to capture their distinct geometric properties. Moreover, the topology attention is integrated to model the interdependencies between surfaces and curves, thereby maintaining topological consistency.

This strategy not only reduces labeling expenses but also results in energy savings during neural network training, thereby enhancing both data and energy efficiency. In this paper, we implement and evaluate various state-of-the-art acquisition functions, analyzing their accuracy and computational costs, while discussing the advantages and disadvantages of each method. Our findings reveal that representativity-based acquisition functions effectively explore the dataset but do not prioritize boundary decisions, whereas uncertainty-based acquisition functions focus on refining boundary decisions already identified by the neural network. This trade-off is known as the exploration-exploitation dilemma. To address this dilemma, we introduce six aggregation structures: series, parallel, hybrid, adaptive feedback, random exploration, and annealing exploration. Our aggregated acquisition functions alleviate common AL pathologies such as batch mode inefficiency and the cold start problem. Additionally, we focus on balancing accuracy and energy consumption, contributing to the development of more sustainable, energy-aware artificial intelligence (AI). We evaluate our proposed structures on various models and datasets. Our results demonstrate the potential of these structures to reduce computational costs while maintaining or even improving accuracy. Innovative aggregation approaches, such as alternating between acquisition functions such as BALD and BADGE, have shown robust results. Sequentially running functions like $K$-Centers followed by BALD has achieved the same performance goals with up to 12\\% fewer samples, while reducing the acquisition cost by almost half.",

A popular and promising approach is to regularize actor-critic methods with behavior cloning (BC), which yields realistic policies and mitigates bias from out-of-distribution actions, but can impose an often-overlooked performance ceiling: when dataset actions are suboptimal, indiscriminate imitation structurally prevents the actor from fully exploiting high-value regions suggested by the critic, especially in later training when imitation is already dominant. We formally analyzed this limitation by investigating convergence properties of BC-regularized actor-critic optimization and verified it on a controlled continuous bandit task. To break this ceiling, we propose proximal action replacement (PAR), a plug-and-play training sample replacer that progressively replaces low-value actions with high-value actions generated by a stable actor, broadening the action exploration space while reducing the impact of low-value data. PAR is compatible with multiple BC regularization paradigms. Extensive experiments across offline RL benchmarks show that PAR consistently improves performance and approaches state-of-the-art when combined with the basic TD3+BC.",

We study the feature sensitivity problem, which asks whether an ensemble is sensitive to a specified subset of features -- such as protected attributes -- whose manipulation can alter model predictions. Existing approaches often yield examples of sensitivity that lie far from the training distribution, limiting their interpretability and practical value. We propose a data-aware sensitivity framework that constrains the sensitive examples to remain close to the dataset, thereby producing realistic and interpretable evidence of model weaknesses. To this end, we develop novel techniques for data-aware search using a combination of mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) and satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) encodings. Our contributions are fourfold. First, we strengthen the NP-hardness result for sensitivity verification, showing it holds even for trees of depth 1. Second, we develop MILP-optimizations that significantly speed up sensitivity verification for single ensembles and for the first time can also handle multiclass tree ensembles. Third, we introduce a data-aware framework generating realistic examples close to the training distribution. Finally, we conduct an extensive experimental evaluation on large tree ensembles, demonstrating scalability to ensembles with up to 800 trees of depth 8, achieving substantial improvements over the state of the art.

However, conventional practices rely on random sequences of fixed length, overlooking the variable-length nature of LLM inputs. Input length directly influences the activation distribution and, consequently, the weight importance captured by the Hessian, which in turn affects quantization outcomes. As a result, Hessian estimates derived from fixed-length calibration may fail to represent the true importance of weights across diverse input scenarios. We propose MaCa (Matryoshka Calibration), a simple yet effective method for length-aware Hessian construction. MaCa (i) incorporates multi-scale sequence length information into Hessian estimation and (ii) regularizes each sequence as an independent sample, yielding a more stable and fruitful Hessian for accurate quantization. Experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g., Qwen3, Gemma3, LLaMA3) demonstrate that MaCa consistently improves accuracy under low bit quantization, offering a lightweight enhancement compatible with existing PTQ frameworks.

This is particularly harmful in modern applications such as learning-enhanced platform operations and post-bandit statistical inference. Thus motivated, we introduce a new performance metric of MAB algorithms termed allocation variability, which is the largest (over arms) standard deviation of an arm's number of pulls. We establish a fundamental trade-off between allocation variability and regret, the canonical performance metric of reward maximization. In particular, for any algorithm, the worst-case regret $R_T$ and worst-case allocation variability $S_T$ must satisfy $R_T \\cdot S_T=\\Omega(T^{\\frac{3}{2}})$ as $T\\rightarrow\\infty$, as long as $R_T=o(T)$. This indicates that any minimax regret-optimal algorithm must incur worst-case allocation variability $\\Theta(T)$, the largest possible scale; while any algorithm with sublinear worst-case regret must necessarily incur ${S}_T= \\omega(\\sqrt{T})$. We further show that this lower bound is essentially tight, and that any point on the Pareto frontier $R_T \\cdot S_T=\\tilde{\\Theta}(T^{3/2})$ can be achieved by a simple tunable algorithm UCB-f, a generalization of the classic UCB1. Finally, we discuss implications for platform operations and for statistical inference, when bandit algorithms are used. As a byproduct of our result, we resolve an open question of Praharaj and Khamaru (2025).",

Transformers, as powerful foundational models, have been applied to scRNA-seq clustering.

Existing methods for scRNA-seq clustering, such as graph transformer-based models, treat each cell as a token in a sequence. Their computational and space complexities are $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ with respect to the number of cells, limiting their applicability to large-scale scRNA-seq this http URL address this challenge, we propose a Bipartite Graph Transformer-based clustering model (BGFormer) for scRNA-seq data. We introduce a set of learnable anchor tokens as shared reference points to represent the entire dataset. A bipartite graph attention mechanism is introduced to learn the similarity between cells and anchor tokens, bringing cells of the same class closer together in the embedding space. BGFormer achieves linear computational complexity with respect to the number of cells, making it scalable to large datasets.

The aim of this work is to form a comprehensive understanding of groundwater salinization underlying causal factors and identify important meteorological, geological and anthropogenic drivers of salinity. We have integrated different datasets of potential covariates, to create a robust framework for machine learning based predictive models including Random Forest (RF), XGBoost, Neural network, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), convolution neural network (CNN) and linear regression (LR), of groundwater salinity. Additionally, Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) followed by Global sensitivity analysis (GSA) and Explainable AI (XAI) based SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) were used to estimate the importance scores and find insights into the drivers of salinization. We also did causality analysis via Double machine learning using various predictive models. From these analyses, key meteorological (Precipitation, Temperature), geological (Distance from river, Distance to saline body, TWI, Shoreline distance), and anthropogenic (Area of agriculture field, Treated Wastewater) covariates are identified to be influential drivers of groundwater salinity across Israel. XAI analysis also identified Treated Wastewater (TWW) as an essential anthropogenic driver of salinity, its significance being context-dependent but critical in vulnerable hydro-climatic environment. Our approach provides deeper insight into global salinization mechanisms at country scale, reducing AI model uncertainty and highlighting the need for tailored strategies to address salinity.",

        "abstract": "Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a widely adopted parameter-efficient fine-tuning method in deep transfer learning, due to its reduced number of trainable parameters and lower memory requirements enabled by Burer-Monteiro factorization on adaptation matrices. However, classical LoRA training methods treat the low-rank factor matrices individually and optimize them using standard gradient-based algorithms. Such decoupled optimization schemes are theoretically and empirically suboptimal, as they fail to fully exploit the intrinsic structure of the LoRA parameterization. In this work, we propose a novel continuous-time optimization dynamic for LoRA factor matrices in the form of an ordinary differential equation (ODE) that emulates the gradient flow of full fine-tuning on the balanced manifold. We term this approach ODELoRA. To faithfully track the trajectories of ODELoRA, we adopt well-established and theoretically grounded time-discretization schemes, including Euler and Runge--Kutta methods. Our framework provides a unified ODE-based perspective for understanding and designing LoRA training algorithms. We establish linear convergence of the proposed method under strongly convex objectives for certain discretization schemes under mild conditions, and further extend our analysis to the matrix sensing setting. Moreover, we show that ODELoRA achieves stable feature learning, a property that is crucial for training deep neural networks at different scales of problem dimensionality. Empirical results on matrix sensing tasks confirm the derived linear convergence behavior, and experiments on training physics-informed neural networks further demonstrate the superiority of ODELoRA over existing baselines, especially in the training stability.",

We further derive a simple formula in terms of these statistics that predicts data-limited neural scaling exponents from first principles without any free parameters or synthetic data models.

Maximal Update Parametrization ($\\mu$P) helps explain why many hyperparameters transfer across width. Yet depth scaling is less understood for modern architectures, whose computation graphs contain multiple parallel paths and residual aggregation. To unify various non-recurrent multi-path neural networks such as CNNs, ResNets, and Transformers, we introduce a graph-based notion of effective depth. Under stabilizing initializations and a maximal-update criterion, we show that the optimal learning rate decays with effective depth following a universal -3/2 power law. Here, the maximal-update criterion maximizes the typical one-step representation change at initialization without causing instability, and effective depth is the minimal path length from input to output, counting layers and residual additions. Experiments across diverse architectures confirm the predicted slope and enable reliable zero-shot transfer of learning rates across depths and widths, turning depth scaling into a predictable hyperparameter-transfer problem.",

This reliance on expert knowledge limits their adaptability to new behaviors, and only enables analysis related to the learned rewards, and not across the behavior modes used to train them. We propose Contrastive Multi-Intention IRL (CoMI-IRL), a transformer-based unsupervised framework that decouples behavior representation and clustering from downstream reward learning. Our experiments show that CoMI-IRL outperforms existing approaches without a priori knowledge of $K^*$ or labels, while allowing for visual interpretation of behavior relationships and adaptation to unseen behavior without full retraining.",

This paper introduces the Pavlovian Associative Learning Models Simulator (PALMS), a Python environment to simulate Pavlovian conditioning experiments. In addition to the canonical Rescorla-Wagner model, PALMS incorporates several attentional learning approaches, including Pearce-Kaye-Hall, Mackintosh Extended, Le Pelley's Hybrid, and a novel extension of the Rescorla-Wagner model with a unified variable learning rate that integrates Mackintosh's and Pearce and Hall's opposing conceptualisations. The simulator's graphical interface allows for the input of entire experimental designs in an alphanumeric format, akin to that used by experimental neuroscientists. Moreover, it uniquely enables the simulation of experiments involving hundreds of stimuli, as well as the computation of configural cues and configural-cue compounds across all models, thereby considerably expanding their predictive capabilities. PALMS operates efficiently, providing instant visualisation of results, supporting rapid, precise comparisons of various models' predictions within a single architecture and environment. Furthermore, graphic displays can be easily saved, and simulated data can be exported to spreadsheets. To illustrate the simulator's capabilities and functionalities, we provide a detailed description of the software and examples of use, reproducing published experiments in the associative learning literature.

However, their sequential autoregressive decoding forces inherently parallel clinical reasoning, such as differential diagnosis, into a single linear reasoning path, limiting both efficiency and reliability for complex medical problems. To address this, we propose MedVerse, a reasoning framework for complex medical inference that reformulates medical reasoning as a parallelizable directed acyclic graph (DAG) process based on Petri net theory. The framework adopts a full-stack design across data, model architecture, and system execution. For data creation, we introduce the MedVerse Curator, an automated pipeline that synthesizes knowledge-grounded medical reasoning paths and transforms them into Petri net-structured representations. At the architectural level, we propose a topology-aware attention mechanism with adaptive position indices that supports parallel reasoning while preserving logical consistency. Systematically, we develop a customized inference engine that supports parallel execution without additional overhead. Empirical evaluations show that MedVerse improves strong general-purpose LLMs by up to 8.9%. Compared to specialized medical LLMs, MedVerse achieves comparable performance while delivering a 1.3x reduction in inference latency and a 1.7x increase in generation throughput, enabled by its parallel decoding capability.",

We introduce \"graph-based conformal compression\", a framework for constructing compact subgraphs that preserve statistical validity while reducing structural complexity. We formulate compression as selecting a smallest subgraph capturing a prescribed fraction of the probability mass, and reduce to a weighted version of densest $k$-subgraphs in hypergraphs, in the regime where the subgraph has a large fraction of edges. We design efficient approximation algorithms that achieve constant factor coverage and size trade-offs. Crucially, we prove that our relaxation satisfies a monotonicity property, derived from a connection to parametric minimum cuts, which guarantees the nestedness required for valid conformal guarantees. Our results on the one hand bridge efficient conformal prediction with combinatorial graph compression via monotonicity, to provide rigorous guarantees on both statistical validity, and compression or size. On the other hand, they also highlight an algorithmic regime, distinct from classical densest-$k$-subgraph hardness settings, where the problem can be approximated efficiently. We finally validate our algorithmic approach via simulations for trip planning and navigation, and compare to natural baselines.",

Numerical investigations show that this task retains key qualitative aspects of how Transformers develop match-and-copy circuits in practice, and separates architectures by their retrieval capabilities. We also analyze the optimization dynamics in a simplified attention setting. Although many solutions are a priori possible under a regression objective, including ones that do not implement retrieval, we identify an implicit-bias regime in which gradient descent drives the parameters to diverge while their direction aligns with the max-margin separator, yielding hard match selection.

        "abstract": "Ensemble methods have played a crucial role in achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across various machine learning tasks by leveraging the diversity of features learned by individual models. In Time Series Classification (TSC), ensembles have proven highly effective whether based on neural networks (NNs) or traditional methods like HIVE-COTE. However most existing NN-based ensemble methods for TSC train multiple models with identical architectures and configurations. These ensembles aggregate predictions without explicitly promoting diversity which often leads to redundant feature representations and limits the benefits of ensembling. In this work, we introduce a diversity-driven ensemble learning framework that explicitly encourages feature diversity among neural network ensemble members. Our approach employs a decorrelated learning strategy using a feature orthogonality loss applied directly to the learned feature representations. This ensures that each model in the ensemble captures complementary rather than redundant information. We evaluate our framework on 128 datasets from the UCR archive and show that it achieves SOTA performance with fewer models. This makes our method both efficient and scalable compared to conventional NN-based ensemble approaches.",

To address this, a surge of deep generative models has recently emerged to learn dynamics at coarsened timesteps for efficient trajectory generation, yet they either generalize poorly across systems or, due to limited molecular diversity of trajectory data, fail to fully exploit structural information to improve generative fidelity. Here, we present the Pretrained Variational Bridge (PVB) in an encoder-decoder fashion, which maps the initial structure into a noised latent space and transports it toward stage-specific targets through augmented bridge matching. This unifies training on both single-structure and paired trajectory data, enabling consistent use of cross-domain structural knowledge across training stages. Moreover, for protein-ligand complexes, we further introduce a reinforcement learning-based optimization via adjoint matching that speeds progression toward the holo state, which supports efficient post-optimization of docking poses. Experiments on proteins and protein-ligand complexes demonstrate that PVB faithfully reproduces thermodynamic and kinetic observables from MD while delivering stable and efficient generative dynamics.",

When trying to turn these metrics into a single ranking, natural aggregation procedures can become incoherent or unstable to changes in the model set. We formalize this aggregation as a social choice problem where each metric induces a preference ranking over models on each dataset, and a benchmark operator aggregates these votes across metrics. While prior work has focused on Arrow's impossibility result, we argue that the impossibility often originates from pathological examples and identify sufficient conditions under which these disappear, and meaningful multi-criteria benchmarking becomes possible. In particular, we deal with three restrictions on the combinations of rankings and prove that on single-peaked, group-separable and distance-restricted preferences, the benchmark operator allows for the construction of well-behaved rankings of the involved models. Empirically, we investigate several modern benchmark suites like HELM MMLU and verify which structural conditions are fulfilled on which benchmark problems.",

Existing mitigation strategies often face critical limitations: they either yield insufficient outlier suppression or incur significant deployment inefficiencies, such as inference latency, heavy preprocessing, or reliance on complex operator fusion. To resolve these limitations, we leverage a key insight: over-parameterized LLMs often converge to Flat Minima, implying a vast equivalent solution space where weights can be adjusted without compromising accuracy. Building on this, we propose Astro, an Activation-guided Structured Regularization framework designed to suppress the negative effects of outliers in a hardware-friendly and efficient manner. Leveraging the activation-guided regularization objective, Astro actively reconstructs intrinsically robust weights, aggressively suppressing weight outliers corresponding to high-magnitude activations without sacrificing model accuracy. Crucially, Astro introduces zero inference latency and is orthogonal to mainstream quantization methods like GPTQ. Extensive experiments show that Astro achieves highly competitive performance; notably, on LLaMA-2-7B, it achieves better performance than complex learning-based rotation methods with almost 1/3 of the quantization time.",

This design yields fast and numerically robust reconstruction by combining local predictors through a partition of unity. To understand where approximation becomes difficult under fixed local capacity, we analyze the method from a spectral Barron norm perspective, which reveals that global reconstruction error is dominated by regions with high spectral complexity.

To address the fundamental tension between batch decoding and expert sparsity, we present SERE, a Similarity-based Expert Re-routing method for Efficient batch decoding in MoE models. SERE dynamically reduces the number of active experts in an input-aware manner by re-routing tokens from secondary experts to their most similar primary counterparts. It also leverages similarity patterns to identify and preserve critical experts, thereby preventing capability loss. Notably, SERE avoids static expert pruning or merging, instead enabling dynamic expert skipping based on batch-level expert redundancy. Additionally, we provide an efficient custom CUDA kernel for SERE, enabling plug-and-play use in vLLM with only a single-line code change. Extensive experiments on various complex reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that SERE achieves up to 2.0x speedup with minimal quality loss, providing a practical solution for cost-efficient and latency-sensitive large-scale MoE deployment.

We consider ReLU neural networks subject to natural constraints on weights and input and output dimensions, which model a notion of dense connectivity. Within this setting, we demonstrate the existence of Lipschitz continuous functions that cannot be approximated by such networks.

We make locality measurable by tracking action-level divergence under controlled latent perturbations, identifying an empirical trust region for behavior-local continuous variation. Using a compact trading-strategy DSL with four semantic components (long/short entry and exit), we learn a matching block-factorized embedding and compare isotropic Gaussian mutation over the full latent space to geometry-compiled mutation that restricts updates to semantically paired entry--exit subspaces and proposes directions using a learned flow-based model trained on logged mutation outcomes. Under identical $(\\mu+\\lambda)$ evolution strategies and fixed evaluation budgets across five assets, the learned mutation operator discovers strong strategies using an order of magnitude fewer evaluations and achieves the highest median out-of-sample Sharpe ratio.

We study compute-optimal test-time strategies for verifiable execution-grounded (VEG) tasks, domains like GPU kernel optimization where a deterministic evaluator provides dense, continuous reward signals. Using KernelBench as our testbed and a 120B-parameter model (GPT-OSS-120B with LoRA adaptation), we find that search outperforms minimal adaptation (1-5 gradient steps): Best-of-N sampling achieves 90% task success (18/20 tasks) at K=64 across the full KernelBench L1 eval set while TTT's best checkpoint reaches only 30.6% (3-seed mean), with TTT's \"equivalent K\" falling below 1, worse than single-sample inference. The failure mode is over-sharpening: gradient updates collapse diversity toward mediocre solutions rather than discovering optimal ones. Our main contribution is surprisal-guided selection: selecting the highest-surprisal (lowest-confidence) correct sample yields 80% success vs. 50% for most-confident selection, a 30% improvement. Extending to surprisal-guided-top3 matches oracle performance at 100%. This zero-cost strategy, validated through length-controlled analysis, recovers oracle performance. For dense-reward VEG tasks, compute should be allocated to sample diversity and intelligent selection rather than gradient adaptation. The surprisal-guided selection principle may generalize to other execution-grounded domains where optimal solutions occupy the distribution tail.",

We introduce Feroma, a novel FL framework that explicitly handles both distribution shift and drift without relying on client or cluster identity. Feroma builds on client distribution profiles-compact, privacy-preserving representations of local data-that guide model aggregation and test-time model assignment through adaptive similarity-based weighting. This design allows Feroma to dynamically select aggregation strategies during training, ranging from clustered to personalized, and deploy suitable models to unseen, and unlabeled test clients without retraining, online adaptation, or prior knowledge on clients' data. Extensive experiments show that compared to 10 state-of-the-art methods, Feroma improves performance and stability under dynamic data heterogeneity conditions-an average accuracy gain of up to 12 percentage points over the best baselines across 6 benchmarks-while maintaining computational and communication overhead comparable to FedAvg.

        "abstract": "Machine learning models now influence decisions that directly affect people's lives, making it important to understand not only their predictions, but also how individuals could act to obtain better results. Algorithmic recourse provides actionable input modifications to achieve more favorable outcomes, typically relying on counterfactual explanations to suggest such changes. However, when the Rashomon set - the set of near-optimal models - is large, standard counterfactual explanations can become unreliable, as a recourse action valid for one model may fail under another. We introduce ElliCE, a novel framework for robust algorithmic recourse that optimizes counterfactuals over an ellipsoidal approximation of the Rashomon set. The resulting explanations are provably valid over this ellipsoid, with theoretical guarantees on uniqueness, stability, and alignment with key feature directions. Empirically, ElliCE generates counterfactuals that are not only more robust but also more flexible, adapting to user-specified feature constraints while being substantially faster than existing baselines. This provides a principled and practical solution for reliable recourse under model uncertainty, ensuring stable recommendations for users even as models evolve.",

This tension is exposed by spline-based Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) parameterizations, where grid refinement can induce parameter growth and brittle optimization in high dimensions. To propose a stability-preserving way to inject spectral capacity into existing MLP/FFN layers under fixed parameter and training budgets, we introduce Spectral Gating Networks (SGN), a drop-in spectral reparameterization. SGN augments a standard activation pathway with a compact spectral pathway and learnable gates that allow the model to start from a stable base behavior and progressively allocate capacity to spectral features during training. The spectral pathway is instantiated with trainable Random Fourier Features (learned frequencies and phases), replacing grid-based splines and removing resolution dependence. A hybrid GELU-Fourier formulation further improves optimization robustness while enhancing high-frequency fidelity. Across vision, NLP, audio, and PDE benchmarks, SGN consistently improves accuracy-efficiency trade-offs under comparable computational budgets, achieving 93.15% accuracy on CIFAR-10 and up to 11.7x faster inference than spline-based KAN variants.

Recent work has improved the training stability of deep PC networks (PCNs) by leveraging some BP-inspired reparameterisations. However, the full scalability and theoretical basis of these approaches remains unclear. To address this, we study the infinite width and depth limits of PCNs. For linear residual networks, we show that the set of width- and depth-stable feature-learning parameterisations for PC is exactly the same as for BP. Moreover, under any of these parameterisations, the PC energy with equilibrated activities converges to the BP loss in a regime where the model width is much larger than the depth, resulting in PC computing the same gradients as BP. Experiments show that these results hold in practice for deep nonlinear networks, as long as an activity equilibrium seem to be reached. Overall, this work unifies various previous theoretical and empirical results and has potentially important implications for the scaling of PCNs.",

While effective for individual prediction problems, this paradigm underutilizes the rich structure of clinical data and limits the transferability, stability, and interpretability of learned features. In this work, we propose dense feature learning, a representation centric framework that explicitly shapes the linear structure of medical embeddings. Our approach operates directly on embedding matrices, encouraging spectral balance, subspace consistency, and feature orthogonality through objectives defined entirely in terms of linear algebraic properties. Without relying on labels or generative reconstruction, dense feature learning produces representations with higher effective rank, improved conditioning, and greater stability across time. Empirical evaluations across longitudinal EHR data, clinical text, and multimodal patient representations demonstrate consistent improvements in downstream linear performance, robustness, and subspace alignment compared to supervised and self supervised baselines. These results suggest that learning to span clinical variation may be as important as learning to predict clinical outcomes, and position representation geometry as a first class objective in medical AI.",

While recent years have seen an increasing development of explainability methods, current evaluation metrics (e.g., fidelity, sparsity) often fail to assess whether an explanation identifies the true underlying causal variables. To address this, we propose the Explanation-Generalization Score (EGS), a metric that quantifies the causal relevance of GNN explanations. EGS is founded on the principle of feature invariance and posits that if an explanation captures true causal drivers, it should lead to stable predictions across distribution shifts. To quantify this, we introduce a framework that trains GNNs using explanatory subgraphs and evaluates their performance in Out-of-Distribution (OOD) settings (here, OOD generalization serves as a rigorous proxy for the explanation's causal validity). Through large-scale validation involving 11,200 model combinations across synthetic and real-world datasets, our results demonstrate that EGS provides a principled benchmark for ranking explainers based on their ability to capture causal substructures, offering a robust alternative to traditional fidelity-based metrics.",

At the same time, a new generation of optimizers (e.g., Muon, Shampoo, SOAP) promises faster and more stable convergence, but their relationship with model and data scaling is not yet well understood. In this work, we study scaling laws across different optimizers. Empirically, we show that 1) separate Chinchilla-style scaling laws for each optimizer are ill-conditioned and have highly correlated parameters. Instead, 2) we propose a more robust law with shared power-law exponents and optimizer-specific rescaling factors, which enable direct comparison between optimizers. Finally, 3) we provide a theoretical analysis of gradient-based methods for the proxy task of a convex quadratic objective, demonstrating that Chinchilla-style scaling laws emerge naturally as a result of loss decomposition into irreducible, approximation, and optimization errors.",

In this work we propose a rigorous analysis of such approximate posterior-samplers, relying on a Gaussianity assumption of the prior. Under this regime, we show that both the ideal posterior sampler and diffusion-based reconstruction algorithms can be expressed in closed-form, enabling their thorough analysis and comparisons in the spectral domain. Building on these representations, we also introduce a principled framework for parameter design, replacing heuristic selection strategies used to date. The proposed approach is method-agnostic and yields tailored parameter choices for each algorithm, jointly accounting for the characteristics of the prior, the degraded signal, and the diffusion dynamics. We show that our spectral recommendations differ structurally from standard heuristics and vary with the diffusion step size, resulting in a consistent balance between perceptual quality and signal fidelity.",

In this paper, we propose that this introspection can be thought of as program analysis. We discuss examples of how this approach can be applied to various kinds of models used in reinforcement learning. We then describe an algorithm that enables efficient goal-oriented planning over the class of models used in relational reinforcement learning, demonstrating a novel link between reinforcement learning and classical planning.",

However, optimization practices in RL largely follow those of next-token prediction stages (e.g., pretraining and supervised fine-tuning), despite fundamental differences between RL and these stages highlighted by recent work. One such practice is the use of the AdamW optimizer, which is widely adopted for training large-scale transformers despite its high memory overhead. Our analysis shows that both momentum and adaptive learning rates in AdamW are less influential in RL than in SFT, leading us to hypothesize that RL benefits less from Adam-style per-parameter adaptive learning rates and momentum. Confirming this hypothesis, our experiments demonstrate that the substantially more memory-efficient SGD, which is known to perform poorly in supervised learning of large-scale transformers, matches or even outperforms AdamW in RL for LLMs. Remarkably, full fine-tuning with SGD updates fewer than 0.02% of model parameters without any sparsity-promoting regularization, more than 1000 times fewer than AdamW. Our analysis offers potential reasons for this update sparsity. These findings provide new insights into the optimization dynamics of RL in LLMs and show that RL can be substantially more parameter-efficient than previously recognized.",

Adaptive Data Analysis (ADA) mechanisms address this challenge; however, there is a fundamental tension between computational efficiency and sample complexity. For $T$ rounds of adaptive analysis, computationally efficient algorithms typically incur suboptimal $O(\\sqrt{T})$ sample complexity, whereas statistically optimal $O(\\log T)$ algorithms are computationally intractable under standard cryptographic assumptions. In this work, we shed light on this trade-off by identifying a natural class of data distributions under which both computational efficiency and optimal sample complexity are achievable. We propose a computationally efficient ADA mechanism that attains optimal $O(\\log T)$ sample complexity when the data distribution is dense with respect to a known prior. This setting includes, in particular, feature--label data distributions arising in distribution-specific learning. As a consequence, our mechanism also yields a sample-efficient (i.e., $O(\\log T)$ samples) statistical query oracle in the distribution-specific setting. Moreover, although our algorithm is not based on differential privacy, it satisfies a relaxed privacy notion known as Predicate Singling Out (PSO) security (Cohen and Nissim, 2020). Our results thus reveal an inherent connection between adaptive data analysis and privacy beyond differential privacy.",

TerraBind tests this hypothesis through a coarse pocket-level representation (protein C$_\\beta$ atoms and ligand heavy atoms only) within a multimodal architecture combining COATI-3 molecular encodings and ESM-2 protein embeddings that learns rich structural representations, which are used in a diffusion-free optimization module for pose generation and a binding affinity likelihood prediction module.

Existing methods often rely on either architecture-specific adaptations or computationally costly inference procedures. We introduce Learnable Chernoff Baselines (LCBs) as a method for efficiently and approximately sampling from the exponentially tilted kernels that arise from KL-regularized reward alignment. Using only black-box sampling access to the pretrained model, LCBs implement a form of rejection sampling with adaptively selected acceptance probabilities, which allows fine-grained control over inference-compute scaling. We establish total-variation guarantees to the ideal aligned model, and demonstrate in both continuous and discrete diffusion settings that LCB sampling closely matches ideal rejection sampling while using substantially fewer queries to the pretrained model.",

We derive three equivalent characterizations of the manifold average velocity (Eulerian, Lagrangian, and semigroup identities), and analyze parameterizations and stabilization techniques to improve training on high-dimensional manifolds. In promoter DNA design and protein backbone generation settings, RMF achieves comparable sample quality to prior methods while requiring up to 10$\\times$ fewer function evaluations.

We show that this failure stems from two structural issues in current methods: destructive gradient interference caused by premature scalarization and representational collapse across the preference space. We introduce $D^3PO$, a PPO-based framework that reorganizes multi-objective policy optimization to address these issues directly. $D^3PO$ preserves per-objective learning signals through a decomposed optimization pipeline and integrates preferences only after stabilization, enabling reliable credit assignment. In addition, a scaled diversity regularizer enforces sensitivity of policy behavior to preference changes, preventing collapse. Across standard MORL benchmarks, including high-dimensional and many-objective control tasks, $D^3PO$ consistently discovers broader and higher-quality Pareto fronts than prior single- and multi-policy methods, matching or exceeding state-of-the-art hypervolume and expected utility while using a single deployable policy.",

With the rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs), state-of-the-art performance in tabular anomaly detection has been achieved by converting tabular data into text and fine-tuning LLMs. However, these methods randomly order columns during conversion, without considering the causal relationships between them, which is crucial for accurately detecting anomalies. In this paper, we present CausalTaD, a method that injects causal knowledge into LLMs for tabular anomaly detection. We first identify the causal relationships between columns and reorder them to align with these causal relationships. This reordering can be modeled as a linear ordering problem. Since each column contributes differently to the causal relationships, we further propose a reweighting strategy to assign different weights to different columns to enhance this effect. Experiments across more than 30 datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods. The code for CausalTAD is available at this https URL.",

In this paper, we make two contributions. First, we prove bounds on the width and depth of ReLU networks needed to approximate the matrix exponential to an arbitrary precision. Second, we show experimentally that a transformer encoder-decoder with suitable numerical encodings can approximate certain matrix functions at a relative error of 5% with high probability.

Controlling how LLMs internally represent concepts typically requires sophisticated methods to first identify, then intervene on the model's existing feature geometry. We bypass all of this. We finetune an LLM with a simple auxiliary loss, training 16 of its 3072 residual stream dimensions to be inert interpretability flags that simply indicate what concepts are required for generation. The model reorganizes around them anyway, learning to rely on these flags during actual generation tasks. As a result, these inert flags become genuine internal features: interpretable control switches that allow us to steer generation at inference time. Why does this work? When a feature is reliably supplied at a fixed location, gradient descent gradually eliminates redundant encodings elsewhere, and the model erodes its own alternative representations. A model's efficiency pressure is a lever - exploitable to induce interpretable, controllable representations.",

In LLM reasoning, existing works also explore various solutions for learning effective process reward models (PRM) with or without the help of an expert policy. However, existing methods either rely on strong assumptions about the expert policies (e.g., requiring their reward functions) or suffer intrinsic limitations (e.g., entropy collapse), resulting in weak PRMs or limited generalizability. In this paper, we introduce rePIRL, an inverse RL-inspired framework that learns effective PRMs with minimal assumptions about expert policies. Specifically, we design a dual learning process that updates the policy and the PRM interchangeably. Our learning algorithm has customized techniques to address the challenges of scaling traditional inverse RL to LLMs. We theoretically show that our proposed learning framework can unify both online and offline PRM learning methods, justifying that rePIRL can learn PRMs with minimal assumptions. Empirical evaluations on standardized math and coding reasoning datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of rePIRL over existing methods. We further show the application of our trained PRM in test-time training, test-time scaling, and providing an early signal for training hard problems. Finally, we validate our training recipe and key design choices via a detailed ablation study.",

Multi-agent collaboration offers a promising avenue to transcend these boundaries. However, existing frameworks typically rely on prompt-based test-time interactions or multi-role configurations trained with homogeneous parameters, limiting error correction capabilities and strategic diversity. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Agent Reinforced Training and Inference Framework with Self-Search Scaling (MARTI-MARS2), which integrates policy learning with multi-agent tree search by formulating the multi-agent collaborative exploration process as a dynamic and learnable environment. By allowing agents to iteratively explore and refine within the environment, the framework facilitates evolution from parameter-sharing homogeneous multi-role training to heterogeneous multi-agent training, breaking through single-agent capability limits. We also introduce an efficient inference strategy MARTI-MARS2-T+ to fully exploit the scaling potential of multi-agent collaboration at test time. We conduct extensive experiments across varied model scales (8B, 14B, and 32B) on challenging code generation benchmarks. Utilizing two collaborating 32B models, MARTI-MARS2 achieves 77.7%, outperforming strong baselines like GPT-5.1. Furthermore, MARTI-MARS2 reveals a novel scaling law: shifting from single-agent to homogeneous multi-role and ultimately to heterogeneous multi-agent paradigms progressively yields higher RL performance ceilings, robust TTS capabilities, and greater policy diversity, suggesting that policy diversity is critical for scaling intelligence via multi-agent reinforcement learning.",

Such loads are characterized by fast workload-driven variability and protection-driven disconnection and reconnection behavior that are not captured by conventional load models. Existing data center load modeling includes physics-based approaches, which provide interpretable structure for grid simulation, and data-driven approaches, which capture empirical workload variability from data. However, physics-based models are typically uncalibrated to facility-level operation, while trajectory alignment in data-driven methods often leads to overfitting and unrealistic dynamic behavior. To resolve these limitations, we design the framework to leverage both physics-based structure and data-driven adaptability. The physics-based structure is parameterized to enable data-driven pattern-consistent calibration from real operational data, supporting facility-level grid planning. We further show that trajectory-level alignment is limited for inherently stochastic data center loads. Therefore, we design the calibration to align temporal and statistical patterns using temporal contrastive learning (TCL). This calibration is performed locally at the facility, and only calibrated parameters are shared with utilities, preserving data privacy. The proposed load model is calibrated by real-world operational load data from the MIT Supercloud, ASU Sol, Blue Waters, and ASHRAE datasets. Then it is integrated into the ANDES platform and evaluated on the IEEE 39-bus, NPCC 140-bus, and WECC 179-bus systems. We find that interactions among LELs can fundamentally alter post-disturbance recovery behavior, producing compound disconnection-reconnection dynamics and delayed stabilization that are not captured by uncalibrated load models.",

        "abstract": "Soft policies in reinforcement learning define policies as Boltzmann distributions over state-action value functions, providing a principled mechanism for balancing exploration and exploitation. However, realizing such soft policies in practice remains challenging. Existing approaches either depend on parametric policies with limited expressivity or employ diffusion-based policies whose intractable likelihoods hinder reliable entropy estimation in soft policy objectives. We address this challenge by directly realizing soft-policy sampling via Langevin dynamics driven by the action gradient of the Q-function. This perspective leads to Langevin Q-Learning (LQL), which samples actions from the target Boltzmann distribution without explicitly parameterizing the policy. However, directly applying Langevin dynamics suffers from slow mixing in high-dimensional and non-convex Q-landscapes, limiting its practical effectiveness. To overcome this, we propose Noise-Conditioned Langevin Q-Learning (NC-LQL), which integrates multi-scale noise perturbations into the value function. NC-LQL learns a noise-conditioned Q-function that induces a sequence of progressively smoothed value landscapes, enabling sampling to transition from global exploration to precise mode refinement. On OpenAI Gym MuJoCo benchmarks, NC-LQL achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods, providing a simple yet powerful solution for online RL.",

Existing methods rely on training-time strategies that do not generalise to unseen constraints during inference, and struggle to handle conditional tasks beyond tabular imputation. While manifold theory offers a principled way to guide generation, current formulations are tied to specific inference-time objectives and are limited to continuous domains. We extend manifold theory to tabular data and expand its scope to handle diverse inference-time objectives. On this foundation, we introduce HARPOON, a tabular diffusion method that guides unconstrained samples along the manifold geometry to satisfy diverse tabular conditions at inference. We validate our theoretical contributions empirically on tasks such as imputation and enforcing inequality constraints, demonstrating HARPOON'S strong performance across diverse datasets and the practical benefits of manifold-aware guidance for tabular data.

In this paper, a novel anti-exploration method based on Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQVAE) and fuzzy clustering in offline RL is proposed. We first propose an efficient pseudo-count method based on the multi-codebook VQVAE to discretize state-action pairs, and design an offline RL anti-exploitation method based on the proposed pseudo-count method to handle the dimension disaster issue and improve the learning efficiency. In addition, a codebook update mechanism based on fuzzy C-means (FCM) clustering is developed to improve the use rate of vectors in codebooks, addressing the information loss issue in the discretization process. The proposed method is evaluated on the benchmark of Datasets for Deep Data-Driven Reinforcement Learning (D4RL), and experimental results show that the proposed method performs better and requires less computing cost in multiple complex tasks compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.",

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often incur an alignment tax: safety post-training can reduce general utility (e.g., reasoning and coding). We argue that this tax primarily arises from continual-learning-style forgetting in sequential alignment, where distribution shift and conflicting objectives cause safety updates to overwrite pre-trained competencies. Accordingly, we cast safety alignment as a continual learning (CL) problem that must balance plasticity (acquiring safety constraints) and stability (preserving general abilities). We propose Orthogonal Gradient Projection for Safety Alignment (OGPSA), a lightweight method that mitigates interference by constraining each safety update to be orthogonal (in a first-order sense) to a learned subspace capturing general capabilities. Specifically, OGPSA estimates a low-rank capability subspace from gradients on a small reference set and projects the safety gradient onto its orthogonal complement before updating. This produces safety-directed updates that minimally perturb prior knowledge while retaining capacity for alignment. OGPSA is plug-and-play and integrates into standard post-training pipelines without large-scale replay, auxiliary objectives, or retraining. Across Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and sequential SFT$\\rightarrow$DPO settings, OGPSA consistently improves the safety--utility Pareto frontier over standard baselines. For instance, on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct under SFT$\\rightarrow$DPO, OGPSA preserves strong safety while recovering general capability, improving SimpleQA from 0.53\\% to 3.03\\% and IFEval from 51.94\\% to 63.96\\%.

To address this, we introduce LMABO, a novel framework that casts a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) as a zero-shot, online strategist for the BO process. At each iteration, LMABO uses a structured state representation to prompt the LLM to select the most suitable acquisition function from a diverse portfolio. In an evaluation across 50 benchmark problems, LMABO demonstrates a significant performance improvement over strong static, adaptive portfolio, and other LLM-based baselines. We show that the LLM's behavior is a comprehensive strategy that adapts to real-time progress, proving its advantage stems from its ability to process and synthesize the complete optimization state into an effective, adaptive policy.",

To demonstrate the practical utility of CausalCompass, we conduct extensive benchmarking of representative TSCD algorithms across eight assumption-violation scenarios. Our experimental results indicate that no single method consistently attains optimal performance across all settings. Nevertheless, the methods exhibiting superior overall performance across diverse scenarios are almost invariably deep learning-based approaches. We further provide hyperparameter sensitivity analyses to deepen the understanding of these findings. We also find, somewhat surprisingly, that NTS-NOTEARS relies heavily on standardized preprocessing in practice, performing poorly in the vanilla setting but exhibiting strong performance after standardization. Finally, our work aims to provide a comprehensive and systematic evaluation of TSCD methods under assumption violations, thereby facilitating their broader adoption in real-world applications.

Motivated by classical mechanics, we introduce Kinetic Path Energy (KPE), an action-like, per-sample diagnostic that measures the accumulated kinetic effort along an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) trajectory. Empirically, KPE exhibits two robust correspondences: (i) higher KPE predicts stronger semantic fidelity; (ii) high-KPE trajectories terminate on low-density manifold frontiers. We further provide theoretical guarantees linking trajectory energy to data density. Paradoxically, this correlation is non-monotonic. At sufficiently high energy, generation can degenerate into memorization. Leveraging the closed-form of empirical flow matching, we show that extreme energies drive trajectories toward near-copies of training examples. This yields a Goldilocks principle and motivates Kinetic Trajectory Shaping (KTS), a training-free two-phase inference strategy that boosts early motion and enforces a late-time soft landing, reducing memorization and improving generation quality across benchmark tasks.",

Traditional machine learning (ML) models, though widely applied to PD detection, often rely on extensive feature engineering and struggle to capture complex feature interactions. This study investigates the effectiveness of attention-based deep learning models for early PD detection using tabular biomedical data. We present a comparative evaluation of four classification models: Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Gradient Boosting, TabNet, and SAINT, using a benchmark dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository consisting of biomedical voice measurements from PD patients and healthy controls. Experimental results show that SAINT consistently outperformed all baseline models across multiple evaluation metrics, achieving a weighted precision of 0.98, weighted recall of 0.97, weighted F1-score of 0.97, a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.9990, and the highest Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC-ROC). TabNet and MLP demonstrated competitive performance, while Gradient Boosting yielded the lowest overall scores. The superior performance of SAINT is attributed to its dual attention mechanism, which effectively models feature interactions within and across samples. These findings demonstrate the diagnostic potential of attention-based deep learning architectures for early Parkinson's disease detection and highlight the importance of dynamic feature representation in clinical prediction tasks.",

In Part~I of this series, we modeled learning as a transport process in the space of parameter distributions and derived the Epistemic Speed Limit, which lower-bounds entropy production under finite-time learning. In this work (Part~II), we study the consequences of this irreversibility for continual learning from a trajectory-level perspective. We show that finite dissipation constrains not only which solutions are reachable, but which learning paths remain dynamically accessible. Although a continuum of task-equivalent realizations can achieve identical task performance, finite-time learning irreversibly selects among these realizations. This selection occurs through the progressive elimination of degrees of freedom that would otherwise enable structural reconfiguration. We refer to this phenomenon as \\emph{critical period closure}: beyond a certain stage of learning, transitions between compatible representations become dynamically inaccessible under any finite dissipation budget. As a result, continual learning failure arises not from the absence of solutions satisfying multiple tasks, but from an irreversible loss of representational freedom induced by prior learning. This reframes catastrophic forgetting as a dynamical constraint imposed by finite-time dissipation, rather than direct task interference.",

Consequently, this multi-task scenario requires addressing critical questions: which tasks are similar, and how and why do they exhibit similarity? In this work, we propose a multi-task similarity measure based on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques, specifically Accumulated Local Effects (ALE) curves. ALE curves are compared using the Fréchet distance, weighted by the data distribution, and the resulting similarity measure incorporates the importance of each feature. The measure is applicable in both single-task learning scenarios, where each task is trained separately, and multi-task learning scenarios, where all tasks are learned simultaneously. The measure is model-agnostic, allowing the use of different machine learning models across tasks. A scaling factor is introduced to account for differences in predictive performance across tasks, and several recommendations are provided for applying the measure in complex scenarios. We validate this measure using four datasets, one synthetic dataset and three real-world datasets. The real-world datasets include a well-known Parkinson's dataset and a bike-sharing usage dataset -- both structured in tabular format -- as well as the CelebA dataset, which is used to evaluate the application of concept bottleneck encoders in a multitask learning setting. The results demonstrate that the measure aligns with intuitive expectations of task similarity across both tabular and non-tabular data, making it a valuable tool for exploring relationships between tasks and supporting informed decision-making.",

        "abstract": "We study the problem of learning neural classifiers in a neurosymbolic setting where the hidden gold labels of input instances must satisfy a logical formula. Learning in this setting proceeds by first computing (a subset of) the possible combinations of labels that satisfy the formula and then computing a loss using those combinations and the classifiers' scores. One challenge is that the space of label combinations can grow exponentially, making learning difficult. We propose a technique that prunes this space by exploiting the intuition that instances with similar latent representations are likely to share the same label. While this intuition has been widely used in weakly supervised learning, its application in our setting is challenging due to label dependencies imposed by logical constraints. We formulate the pruning process as an integer linear program that discards inconsistent label combinations while respecting logical structure. Our approach, CLIPPER, is orthogonal to existing training algorithms and can be seamlessly integrated with them. Across 16 benchmarks over complex neurosymbolic tasks, we demonstrate that CLIPPER boosts the performance of state-of-the-art neurosymbolic engines like Scallop, Dolphin, and ISED by up to 48%, 53%, and 8%, leading to state-of-the-art accuracies.",

        "abstract": "Contemporary ML often equates intelligence with optimization: searching for solutions within a fixed representational geometry. This works in static regimes but breaks under distributional shift, task permutation, and continual learning, where even mild topological changes can invalidate learned solutions and trigger catastrophic forgetting. We propose Metric-Topology Factorization (MTF) as a unifying geometric principle: intelligence is not navigation through a fixed maze, but the ability to reshape representational geometry so desired behaviors become stable attractors. Learning corresponds to metric contraction (a controlled deformation of Riemannian structure), while task identity and environmental variation are encoded topologically and stored separately in memory. We show any fixed metric is geometrically incomplete: for any local metric representation, some topological transformations make it singular or incoherent, implying an unavoidable stability-plasticity tradeoff for weight-based systems. MTF resolves this by factorizing stable topology from plastic metric warps, enabling rapid adaptation via geometric switching rather than re-optimization. Building on this, we introduce the Topological Urysohn Machine (TUM), implementing MTF through memory-amortized metric inference (MAMI): spectral task signatures index amortized metric transformations, letting a single learned geometry be reused across permuted, reflected, or parity-altered environments. This explains robustness to task reordering, resistance to catastrophic forgetting, and generalization across transformations that defeat conventional continual learning methods (e.g., EWC).",

Despite this progress, it remains unclear which compositional problems are learnable in this setting using outcome-level feedback alone. In this work, we theoretically study the learnability of compositional problems in autoregressive models under RLVR training. We identify a quantity that we call the task-advantage ratio, a joint property of the compositional problem and the base model, that characterizes which tasks and compositions are learnable from outcome-level feedback. On the positive side, using this characterization, we show that compositional problems where correct intermediate steps provide a clear advantage are efficiently learnable with RLVR. We also analyze how such an advantage naturally arises in different problems. On the negative side, when the structural advantage is not present, RLVR may converge to suboptimal compositions. We prove that, in some cases, the quality of the base model determines if such an advantage exists and whether RLVR will converge to a suboptimal solution. We hope our analysis can provide a principled theoretical understanding of when and why RLVR succeeds and when it does not.",

This raises a fundamental question: which models should be selected when forming an LLM ensemble? We formulate budgeted ensemble selection as maximizing the mutual information between the true label and predictions of the selected models. Furthermore, to explain why performance can saturate even with many models, we model the correlated errors of the models using Gaussian-copula and show an information-theoretic error floor for the performance of the ensemble. Motivated by these, we propose a simple greedy mutual-information selection algorithm that estimates the required information terms directly from data and iteratively builds an ensemble under a query budget. We test our approach in two question answering datasets and one binary sentiment classification dataset: MEDMCQA, MMLU, and IMDB movie reviews. Across all datasets, we observe that our method consistently outperforms strong baselines under the same query budget.",

Orthogonally, projection-based low-rank optimizers were mainly designed for memory efficiency, but remain suboptimal for communication-limited training: one-sided synchronization still transmits an $O(rn)$ object for an $m\\times n$ matrix gradient and refresh steps can dominate peak communicated bytes. We propose TSR, which brings two-sided low-rank communication to Adam-family updates (TSR-Adam) by synchronizing a compact core $U^\\top G V\\in\\mathbb{R}^{r\\times r}$, reducing the dominant per-step payload from $O(mn)$ to $O(r^2)$ while keeping moment states in low-dimensional cores. To further reduce the peak communication from subspace refresh, TSR-Adam adopts a randomized SVD-based refresh that avoids full-gradient synchronization. We additionally extend low-rank communication to embedding gradients with embedding-specific ranks and refresh schedules, yielding additional communication and memory savings over keeping embeddings dense. Across pretraining from 60M to 1B model scales, TSR-Adam reduces average communicated bytes per step by $13\\times$, and on GLUE fine-tuning it reduces communication by $25\\times$, while achieving comparable performance; we further provide a theoretical stationarity analysis for the proposed update.

Our formulation renders possible to express a rich family of operators over generative models densities, including intersection (e.g., to enforce safety), union (e.g., to compose diverse models), interpolation (e.g., for discovery), their reward-guided counterparts, as well as complex logical expressions via generative circuits. Next, we introduce Reward-Guided Flow Merging (RFM), a mirror-descent scheme that reduces reward-guided flow merging to a sequence of standard fine-tuning problems. Then, we provide first-of-their-kind theoretical guarantees for reward-guided and pure flow merging via RFM. Ultimately, we showcase the capabilities of the proposed method on illustrative settings providing visually interpretable insights, and apply our method to high-dimensional de-novo molecular design and low-energy conformer generation.",

As an important branch of large language model(LLM), MoE model only activate a subset of experts based on a routing network. This sparse conditional computation mechanism significantly improves computational efficiency, paving a promising path for greater scalability and cost-efficiency. It not only enhance downstream applications such as natural language processing, computer vision, and multimodal in various horizontal domains, but also exhibit broad applicability across vertical domains. Despite the growing popularity and application of MoE models across various domains, there lacks a systematic exploration of recent advancements of MoE in many important fields. Existing surveys on MoE suffer from limitations such as lack coverage or none extensively exploration of key areas. This survey seeks to fill these gaps. In this paper, Firstly, we examine the foundational principles of MoE, with an in-depth exploration of its core components-the routing network and expert network. Subsequently, we extend beyond the centralized paradigm to the decentralized paradigm, which unlocks the immense untapped potential of decentralized infrastructure, enables democratization of MoE development for broader communities, and delivers greater scalability and cost-efficiency. Furthermore we focus on exploring its vertical domain applications. Finally, we also identify key challenges and promising future research directions. To the best of our knowledge, this survey is currently the most comprehensive review in the field of MoE. We aim for this article to serve as a valuable resource for both researchers and practitioners, enabling them to navigate and stay up-to-date with the latest advancements.",

However, current methods often depend on replay-based strategies, which raise concerns like memory limits and privacy issues, while also struggling to resolve the stability-plasticity dilemma. In this paper, we suggest that lightweight, task-specific modules can effectively guide the reasoning process of a fixed GNN backbone. Based on this idea, we propose Task-Aware Adaptive Modulation (TAAM). The key component of TAAM is its lightweight Neural Synapse Modulators (NSMs). For each new task, a dedicated NSM is trained and then frozen, acting as an \"expert module.\" These modules perform detailed, node-attentive adaptive modulation on the computational flow of a shared GNN backbone. This setup ensures that new knowledge is kept within compact, task-specific modules, naturally preventing catastrophic forgetting without using any data replay. Additionally, to address the important challenge of unknown task IDs in real-world scenarios, we propose and theoretically prove a novel method named Anchored Multi-hop Propagation (AMP). Notably, we find that existing GCL benchmarks have flaws that can cause data leakage and biased evaluations. Therefore, we conduct all experiments in a more rigorous inductive learning scenario. Extensive experiments show that TAAM comprehensively outperforms state-of-the-art methods across eight datasets. Code and Datasets are available at: this https URL.",

        "abstract": "Training large language model (LLM) agents for adversarial games is often driven by episodic objectives such as win rate. In long-horizon settings, however, payoffs are shaped by latent strategic externalities that evolve over time, so myopic optimization and variation-based regret analyses can become vacuous even when the dynamics are predictable. To solve this problem, we introduce Implicit Strategic Optimization (ISO), a prediction-aware framework in which each agent forecasts the current strategic context and uses it to update its policy online. ISO combines a Strategic Reward Model (SRM) that estimates the long-run strategic value of actions with iso-grpo, a context-conditioned optimistic learning rule. We prove sublinear contextual regret and equilibrium convergence guarantees whose dominant terms scale with the number of context mispredictions; when prediction errors are bounded, our bounds recover the static-game rates obtained when strategic externalities are known. Experiments in 6-player No-Limit Texas Hold'em and competitive Pokemon show consistent improvements in long-term return over strong LLM and RL baselines, and graceful degradation under controlled prediction noise.",

        "abstract": "Algorithm-Based Fault Tolerance (ABFT) is widely adopted to detect silent data corruptions (SDCs) in matrix multiplication, a cornerstone operation in deep learning systems. However, existing threshold determination methods face critical challenges: analytical bounds are overly conservative, while probabilistic approaches like A-ABFT yield thresholds $160$--$4200\\times$ larger than actual rounding errors. We present V-ABFT, a variance-based adaptive threshold algorithm that achieves tighter error bounds by directly modeling the verification difference. By leveraging statistical variance estimation, V-ABFT reduces the threshold-to-actual-error ratio to approximately $7$--$20\\times$ for FP32/FP64 and $48$--$158\\times$ for BF16, representing a \\textbf{6--48$\\times$ improvement} over A-ABFT while maintaining zero false positive rate across BF16, FP16, FP32, and FP64 precisions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that for fused-kernel ABFT implementations that verify before output quantization, low-precision GEMM can use FP32-level thresholds ($e_{\\max} \\approx 10^{-6}$), enabling \\textbf{$\\sim$1000$\\times$ finer detection granularity} compared to offline verification with low-precision output ($e_{\\max} \\approx 10^{-3}$). We reproduce A-ABFT's experimental setup and validate our implementation against the original paper's results. Our method requires only $O(n)$ complexity using max/min/mean statistics, compared to A-ABFT's $O(pn)$ for finding $p$ largest values. Extensive experiments on synthetic data and real model weights (LLaMA-7B, GPT-2, ViT) demonstrate V-ABFT's effectiveness across diverse distributions. V-ABFT is platform-agnostic and has been integrated into fault-tolerant GEMM implementations on both NPUs and GPUs.",

To address this, we propose Epigraph-Guided Flow Matching (EpiFlow), a framework that formulates safe offline RL as a state-constrained optimal control problem to co-optimize safety and performance. We learn a feasibility value function derived from an epigraph reformulation of the optimal control problem, thereby avoiding the decoupled objectives or post-hoc filtering common in prior work. Policies are synthesized by reweighting the behavior distribution based on this epigraph value function and fitting a generative policy via flow matching, enabling efficient, distribution-consistent sampling. Across various safety-critical tasks, including Safety-Gymnasium benchmarks, EpiFlow achieves competitive returns with near-zero empirical safety violations, demonstrating the effectiveness of epigraph-guided policy synthesis.",

Among many approaches to mitigate the inefficiencies of sequential token-by-token generation, Speculative Decoding (SD) has emerged as a promising technique. However, SD at the edge is hindered by two major challenges: (1) integrating SD into a compiler-based workflow without sacrificing performance or programmability, and (2) exploiting the heterogeneous compute resources of modern SoCs through carefully designed partitioning strategies. This work addresses these challenges by using an analytical cost model that explores heterogeneous hardware configurations and guides coarse-grained partitioning of LLM subgraphs, particularly with edge-typical short input sequence lengths. The cost model predicts when speculative sampling and heterogeneous execution are jointly beneficial and is validated on an edge device featuring a hexacore Cortex-A CPU and a Mali GPU, revealing up to 1.68$\\times$ speedup for translation tasks, closely matching analytic expectations.",

However, these systems remain susceptible to malicious prompts that induce unsafe or policy-violating behavior through harmful requests, jailbreak techniques, and prompt injection attacks. Existing defenses face fundamental limitations: black-box moderation APIs offer limited transparency and adapt poorly to evolving threats, while white-box approaches using large LLM judges impose prohibitive computational costs and require expensive retraining for new attacks. Current systems force designers to choose between performance, efficiency, and adaptability. To address these challenges, we present BAGEL (Bootstrap AGgregated Ensemble Layer), a modular, lightweight, and incrementally updatable framework for malicious prompt detection. BAGEL employs a bootstrap aggregation and mixture of expert inspired ensemble of fine-tuned models, each specialized on a different attack dataset. At inference, BAGEL uses a random forest router to identify the most suitable ensemble member, then applies stochastic selection to sample additional members for prediction aggregation. When new attacks emerge, BAGEL updates incrementally by fine-tuning a small prompt-safety classifier (86M parameters) and adding the resulting model to the ensemble. BAGEL achieves an F1 score of 0.92 by selecting just 5 ensemble members (430M parameters), outperforming OpenAI Moderation API and ShieldGemma which require billions of parameters. Performance remains robust after nine incremental updates, and BAGEL provides interpretability through its router's structural features. Our results show ensembles of small finetuned classifiers can match or exceed billion-parameter guardrails while offering the adaptability and efficiency required for production systems.",

Consequently, learning an unknown distribution with non-asymptotic and easy-to-compute error bounds in Wasserstein distance has become a fundamental problem in many fields. In this paper, we devise a novel algorithmic and theoretical framework to approximate an unknown probability distribution $\\mathbb{P}$ from a finite set of samples by an approximate discrete distribution $\\widehat{\\mathbb{P}}$ while bounding the Wasserstein distance between $\\mathbb{P}$ and $\\widehat{\\mathbb{P}}$. Our framework leverages optimal transport, nonlinear optimization, and concentration inequalities. In particular, we show that, even if $\\mathbb{P}$ is unknown, the Wasserstein distance between $\\mathbb{P}$ and $\\widehat{\\mathbb{P}}$ can be efficiently bounded with high confidence by solving a tractable optimization problem (a mixed integer linear program) of a size that only depends on the size of the support of $\\widehat{\\mathbb{P}}$. This enables us to develop intelligent clustering algorithms to optimally find the support of $\\widehat{\\mathbb{P}}$ while minimizing the Wasserstein distance error. On a set of benchmarks, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art comparable methods by generally returning approximating distributions with substantially smaller support and tighter error bounds.",

Prior attempts to combine their strengths typically lead to a stability-performance trade-off. We attribute this phenomenon to a structural incompatibility within a single-stream design: Any application of the Post-Norm operation inevitably obstructs the clean identity gradient preserved by Pre-Norm. To fundamentally reconcile these paradigms, we propose SiameseNorm, a two-stream architecture that couples Pre-Norm-like and Post-Norm-like streams with shared parameters. This design decouples the optimization dynamics of the two streams, retaining the distinct characteristics of both Pre-Norm and Post-Norm by enabling all residual blocks to receive combined gradients inherited from both paradigms, where one stream secures stability while the other enhances expressivity. Extensive pre-training experiments on 1.3B-parameter models demonstrate that SiameseNorm exhibits exceptional optimization robustness and consistently outperforms strong baselines.

Existing bandit-based methods treat time merely as a timestamp, neglecting its explicit relationship with user preferences and leading to suboptimal performance. Moreover, online learning methods often suffer from inefficient exploration-exploitation during the early online phase. To address these issues, we propose HyperBandit+, a novel contextual bandit policy that integrates a time-aware hypernetwork to adapt to time-varying user preferences and employs a large language model-assisted warm-start mechanism (LLM Start) to enhance exploration-exploitation efficiency in the early online phase. Specifically, HyperBandit+ leverages a neural network that takes time features as input and generates parameters for estimating time-varying rewards by capturing the correlation between time and user preferences. Additionally, the LLM Start mechanism employs multi-step data augmentation to simulate realistic interaction data for effective offline learning, providing warm-start parameters for the bandit policy in the early online phase. To meet real-time streaming recommendation demands, we adopt low-rank factorization to reduce hypernetwork training complexity. Theoretically, we rigorously establish a sublinear regret upper bound that accounts for both the hypernetwork and the LLM warm-start mechanism. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that HyperBandit+ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of accumulated rewards.",

We propose mmSIVAE, a multimodal soft-introspective variational autoencoder combined with Mixture-of-Product-of-Experts (MOPOE) aggregation to improve reference fidelity and multimodal integration. We compute deviation scores in latent space and feature space as distances from the learned healthy distributions, and map statistically significant latent deviations to regional abnormalities for interpretability. On ADNI MRI regional volumes and amyloid PET SUVR, mmSIVAE improves reconstruction on held-out controls and produces more discriminative deviation scores for outlier detection than VAE baselines, with higher likelihood ratios and clearer separation between control and AD-spectrum cohorts. Deviation maps highlight region-level patterns aligned with established AD-related changes.

        "abstract": "LLMs are typically fine-tuned offline on domain-specific data, assuming a static domain. In practice, domain knowledge evolves continuously through new regulations, products, services, and interaction patterns. Retraining or fine-tuning LLMs for every new instance is computationally infeasible. Additionally, real-world environments also exhibit temporal dynamics with shifting data distributions. Disregarding this phenomenon, commonly referred to as concept drift, can significantly diminish a model's predictive accuracy. This mismatch between evolving domains and static adaptation pipelines highlights the need for efficient, real-time adaptation without costly retraining. In response, we introduce Online Domain-aware Decoding framework (ODD). ODD performs probability-level fusion between a base LLM and a prefix-tree prior, guided by adaptive confidence modulation using disagreement and continuity signals. Empirical evaluation under diverse drift scenarios demonstrates that ODD consistently surpasses LLM-Greedy and LLM-Temp Scaled across all syntactic and semantic NLG metrics. It yields an absolute ROUGE-L gain of 0.065 and a 13.6% relative improvement in Cosine Similarity over the best baseline. These results demonstrate ODD 's robustness to evolving lexical and contextual patterns, making it suitable for dynamic LLM applications.",

We cast it as an Information Bottleneck question: what embedding bottleneck dimension is sufficient to compress predictor and predicted views while preserving their mutual information (MI). This repurposes neural MI estimators for dimensionality estimation. We show that standard neural estimators with separable/bilinear critics systematically inflate the inferred dimension, and we address this by introducing a hybrid critic that retains an explicit dimensional bottleneck while allowing flexible nonlinear cross-view interactions, thereby preserving the latent geometry. We further propose a one-shot protocol that reads off the effective dimension from a single over-parameterized hybrid model, without sweeping over bottleneck sizes. We validate the approach on synthetic problems with known task-relevant dimension. We extend the approach to intrinsic dimensionality by constructing paired views of a single dataset, enabling comparison with classical geometric dimension estimators. In noisy regimes where those estimators degrade, our approach remains reliable. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of the method on multiple physics datasets.",

Although existing approaches address imbalance through resampling or cost-sensitive learning during training, they require retraining or access to labeled target data when class distributions shift at deployment time, a common occurrence in real-world applications such as fraud detection, medical diagnosis, and anomaly detection. We present \\textit{Online Bayesian Imbalanced Learning} (OBIL), a principled framework that decouples likelihood-ratio estimation from class-prior assumptions, enabling real-time adaptation to distribution shifts without model retraining. Our approach builds on the established connection between Bregman divergences and proper scoring rules to show that deep networks trained with such losses produce posterior probability estimates from which prior-invariant likelihood ratios can be extracted. We prove that these likelihood-ratio estimates remain valid under arbitrary changes in class priors and cost structures, requiring only a threshold adjustment for optimal Bayes decisions. We derive finite-sample regret bounds demonstrating that OBIL achieves $O(\\sqrt{T \\log T})$ regret against an oracle with perfect prior knowledge. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and medical diagnosis benchmarks under simulated deployment shifts demonstrate that OBIL maintains robust performance under severe distribution shifts, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in F1 Score when test distributions deviate significantly from the training conditions.",

        "abstract": "Machine learning applications require fast and reliable per-sample uncertainty estimation. A common approach is to use predictive distributions from Bayesian or approximation methods and additively decompose uncertainty into aleatoric (i.e., data-related) and epistemic (i.e., model-related) components. However, additive decomposition has recently been questioned, with evidence that it breaks down when using finite-ensemble sampling and/or mismatched predictive distributions. This paper introduces Variance-Gated Ensembles (VGE), an intuitive, differentiable framework that injects epistemic sensitivity via a signal-to-noise gate computed from ensemble statistics. VGE provides: (i) a Variance-Gated Margin Uncertainty (VGMU) score that couples decision margins with ensemble predictive variance; and (ii) a Variance-Gated Normalization (VGN) layer that generalizes the variance-gated uncertainty mechanism to training via per-class, learnable normalization of ensemble member probabilities. We derive closed-form vector-Jacobian products enabling end-to-end training through ensemble sample mean and variance. VGE matches or exceeds state-of-the-art information-theoretic baselines while remaining computationally efficient. As a result, VGE provides a practical and scalable approach to epistemic-aware uncertainty estimation in ensemble models. An open-source implementation is available at: this https URL.",

Centroid distance in the low-dimensional subspace matches trained probe performance (0.90 AUC), enabling few-shot detection: on GPT-2, 25 labeled examples achieve 89% of full-data accuracy. We validate causally through activation steering: the learned direction produces 10.9 percentage point changes in error rates while random directions show no effect. Internal probes achieve 0.80-0.97 AUC; output-based methods (P(True), semantic entropy) achieve only 0.44-0.64 AUC. The correctness signal exists internally but is not expressed in outputs.

However, standard approaches typically rely on activation addition, a geometric operation that inevitably alters the magnitude of hidden representations. This raises concerns about representation collapse and degradation of open-ended generation capabilities. In this work, we explore Spherical Steering, a training-free primitive that resolves this trade-off through activation rotation. Rather than shifting activations with a fixed vector, our method rotates them along a geodesic toward a target direction, guiding the activation toward the target concept while preserving the integrity of the signal. To further enhance adaptivity, we incorporate a confidence gate that dynamically modulates steering strength based on input uncertainty. Extensive experiments across multiple-choice benchmarks demonstrate that Spherical Steering significantly outperforms addition-based baselines (notably by +10% on TruthfulQA, COPA, and Storycloze), while simultaneously maintaining the model's general open-ended generation quality. This work highlights the value of geometric consistency, suggesting that norm-preserving rotation is a robust and effective primitive for precise inference-time control.",

A critical question is whether statistically detectable heterogeneity translates into improved treatment decisions -- these are distinct questions that can yield contradictory answers. We present a modular causal machine learning framework that evaluates each question separately: permutation importance identifies which features predict heterogeneity, best linear predictor (BLP) testing assesses statistical significance, and doubly robust policy evaluation measures whether acting on the heterogeneity improves patient outcomes. We apply this framework to patient-level data from the UNIFI maintenance trial of ustekinumab in ulcerative colitis, comparing placebo, standard-dose ustekinumab every 12 weeks, and dose-intensified ustekinumab every 8 weeks, using cross-fitted X-learner models with baseline demographics, medication history, week-8 clinical scores, laboratory biomarkers, and video-derived endoscopic features. BLP testing identified strong associations between endoscopic features and treatment effect heterogeneity for ustekinumab versus placebo, yet doubly robust policy evaluation showed no improvement in expected remission from incorporating endoscopic features, and out-of-fold multi-arm evaluation showed worse performance. Diagnostic comparison of prognostic contribution against policy value revealed that endoscopic scores behaved as disease severity markers -- improving outcome prediction in untreated patients but adding noise to treatment selection -- while clinical variables (fecal calprotectin, age, CRP) captured the decision-relevant variation. These results demonstrate that causal machine learning applications to clinical trials should include policy-level evaluation alongside heterogeneity testing.",

The kernel function defining the noise structure is parameterized via neural networks and decomposed into a product form to preserve the Markov property.

To address this, we propose Dreaming in Code (DiCode), a framework in which foundation models synthesize executable environment code to scaffold learning toward increasing competence. In DiCode, \"dreaming\" takes the form of materializing code-level variations of the world. We instantiate DiCode in Craftax, a challenging open-ended benchmark characterized by rich mechanics and long-horizon progression. Empirically, DiCode enables agents to acquire long-horizon skills, achieving a $16\\%$ improvement in mean return over the strongest baseline and non-zero success on late-game combat tasks where prior methods fail.

As such data often co-evolves with multiple variables interacting with each other, estimating the time-varying dependencies between variables (i.e., the dynamic network structure) has become crucial for accurate modeling. However, real-world data is often represented as tensor time series with multiple modes, resulting in large, entangled networks that are hard to interpret and computationally intensive to estimate. In this paper, we propose Kronecker Time-Varying Graphical Lasso (KTVGL), a method designed for modeling tensor time series. Our approach estimates mode-specific dynamic networks in a Kronecker product form, thereby avoiding overly complex entangled structures and producing interpretable modeling results. Moreover, the partitioned network structure prevents the exponential growth of computational time with data dimension. In addition, our method can be extended to stream algorithms, making the computational time independent of the sequence length. Experiments on synthetic data show that the proposed method achieves higher edge estimation accuracy than existing methods while requiring less computation time. To further demonstrate its practical value, we also present a case study using real-world data. Our source code and datasets are available at this https URL.",

However, we argue that the dominant Supervised Learning (SL) training paradigm suffers from a fundamental objective mismatch: minimizing imitation loss (e.g., cross-entropy) does not guarantee solution cost minimization. We dissect this mismatch into two deficiencies: Decoder-Blindness (being oblivious to the non-differentiable decoding process) and Cost-Blindness (prioritizing structural imitation over solution quality). We empirically demonstrate that these intrinsic flaws impose a hard performance ceiling. To overcome this limitation, we propose CADO (Cost-Aware Diffusion models for Optimization), a streamlined Reinforcement Learning fine-tuning framework that formulates the diffusion denoising process as an MDP to directly optimize the post-decoded solution cost. We introduce Label-Centered Reward, which repurposes ground-truth labels as unbiased baselines rather than imitation targets, and Hybrid Fine-Tuning for parameter-efficient adaptation. CADO achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse benchmarks, validating that objective alignment is essential for unlocking the full potential of heatmap-based solvers.",

        "abstract": "Molecule generation and optimization is a fundamental task in chemical domain. The rapid development of intelligent tools, especially large language models (LLMs) with powerful knowledge reserves and interactive capabilities, has provided new paradigms for it. Nevertheless, the intrinsic challenge for LLMs lies in the complex implicit relationship between molecular structure and pharmacological properties and the lack of corresponding labeled data. To bridge this gap, we propose DrugR, an LLM-based method that introduces explicit, step-by-step pharmacological reasoning into the optimization process. Our approach integrates domain-specific continual pretraining, supervised fine-tuning via reverse data engineering, and self-balanced multi-granular reinforcement learning. This framework enables DrugR to effectively improve key ADMET properties while preserving the original molecule's core efficacy. Experimental results demonstrate that DrugR achieves comprehensive enhancement across multiple properties without compromising structural similarity or target binding affinity. Importantly, its explicit reasoning process provides clear, interpretable rationales for each optimization step, yielding actionable design insights and advancing toward automated, knowledge-driven scientific discovery. Our code and model checkpoints are open-sourced to foster future research.",

Such methods, while significantly more computationally favorable compared to their numerical counterparts, fail to provide any calibrated notions of uncertainty in their predictions. Current methods approach this deficiency typically with ensembling or Bayesian posterior estimation. However, these approaches either require distributional assumptions that fail to hold in practice or lack practical scalability, limiting their applications in practice. We, therefore, propose a novel application of conformal prediction to produce distribution-free uncertainty quantification over the function spaces mapped by neural operators. We then demonstrate how such prediction regions enable a formal regret characterization if leveraged in downstream robust decision-making tasks. We further demonstrate how such posited robust decision-making tasks can be efficiently solved using an infinite-dimensional generalization of Danskin's Theorem and calculus of variations and empirically demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method over more restrictive modeling paradigms, such as Gaussian Processes, across several engineering tasks.",

In this work, we propose a first-principles framework for information dynamics, treating the attention mechanism as a physical system governed by the principle of least action rather than as an algorithmic optimization. By mapping information states to a Riemannian manifold with the Fisher information metric, we derive the intelligence Lagrangian. We show that the softmax function corresponds to the unique thermodynamic equilibrium state that minimizes the Helmholtz free energy of the information gas. In addition, we identify the query-key interaction as an electrodynamic coupling between an external field and an intrinsic dipole moment. This theory establishes the first law of information thermodynamics, unifying inference (mechanical work) and learning (chemical evolution). It also explains emergent phenomena, such as scaling laws and grokking, as phase transitions characterized by the divergence of specific heat. Finally, we discuss how rotational symmetry breaking in the attention manifold generates massless Goldstone bosons, providing a field-theoretic perspective on rotary positional embeddings (RoPE).

Interestingly, the by-product of \\textit{competition} for sparsity introduces an extra local \\textit{attraction} and interplay into the evolutionary process: if one competitor has more zero elements, the other competitor's non-zero elements will occupy those positions, even though the less sparse competitor loses to the more sparse competitor in other positions.

In this paper, we propose SkillRL, a framework that bridges the gap between raw experience and policy improvement through automatic skill discovery and recursive evolution. Our approach introduces an experience-based distillation mechanism to build a hierarchical skill library SkillBank, an adaptive retrieval strategy for general and task-specific heuristics, and a recursive evolution mechanism that allows the skill library to co-evolve with the agent's policy during reinforcement learning. These innovations significantly reduce the token footprint while enhancing reasoning utility. Experimental results on ALFWorld, WebShop and seven search-augmented tasks demonstrate that SkillRL achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong baselines over 15.3% and maintaining robustness as task complexity increases.

Yet, the mechanisms underlying their training performance and generalization remain underexplored. In this paper, we provide several insights into such fine-tuning through the lens of linearization. Fine-tuned models are often implicitly encouraged to remain close to the pretrained model. By making this explicit, using an Euclidean distance inductive bias in parameter space, we show that fine-tuning dynamics become equivalent to learning with the positive-definite neural tangent kernel (NTK). We specifically analyze how close the fully linear and the linearized fine-tuning optimizations are, based on the strength of the regularization. This allows us to be pragmatic about how good a model linearization is when fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). When linearization is a good model, our findings reveal a strong correlation between the eigenvalue spectrum of the NTK and the performance of model adaptation. Motivated by this, we give spectral perturbation bounds on the NTK induced by the choice of layers selected for fine-tuning. We empirically validate our theory on Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on LLMs. These insights not only characterize fine-tuning but also have the potential to enhance PEFT techniques, paving the way to better informed and more nimble adaptation in LLMs.",

However, existing ICRL methods rely on explicit reward signals during pretraining, which limits their applicability when rewards are ambiguous, hard to specify, or costly to obtain. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new learning paradigm, In-Context Preference-based Reinforcement Learning (ICPRL), in which both pretraining and deployment rely solely on preference feedback, eliminating the need for reward supervision. We study two variants that differ in the granularity of feedback: Immediate Preference-based RL (I-PRL) with per-step preferences, and Trajectory Preference-based RL (T-PRL) with trajectory-level comparisons. We first show that supervised pretraining, a standard approach in ICRL, remains effective under preference-only context datasets, demonstrating the feasibility of in-context reinforcement learning using only preference signals. To further improve data efficiency, we introduce alternative preference-native frameworks for I-PRL and T-PRL that directly optimize TM policies from preference data without requiring reward signals nor optimal action this http URL on dueling bandits, navigation, and continuous control tasks demonstrate that ICPRL enables strong in-context generalization to unseen tasks, achieving performance comparable to ICRL methods trained with full reward supervision.",

Although Decision Transformers provide powerful sequence modeling capabilities, applying them to this constrained setting encounters two challenges: 1) standard Return-to-Go conditioning causes state aliasing by neglecting the cost dimension, preventing precise resource pacing; and 2) standard regression forces the policy to mimic average historical behaviors, thereby limiting the capacity to optimize performance toward the constraint boundary. To address these challenges, we propose PRO-Bid, a constraint-aware generative auto-bidding framework based on two synergistic mechanisms: 1) Constraint-Decoupled Pareto Representation (CDPR) decomposes global constraints into recursive cost and value contexts to restore resource perception, while reweighting trajectories based on the Pareto frontier to focus on high-efficiency data; and 2) Counterfactual Regret Optimization (CRO) facilitates active improvement by utilizing a global outcome predictor to identify superior counterfactual actions. By treating these high-utility outcomes as weighted regression targets, the model transcends historical averages to approach the optimal constraint boundary. Extensive experiments on two public benchmarks and online A/B tests demonstrate that PRO-Bid achieves superior constraint satisfaction and value acquisition compared to state-of-the-art baselines.",

Such unknown transformations arise widely in machine learning and scientific modeling, where they can significantly distort observations. We take a probabilistic view and model the posterior over transformations as a Boltzmann distribution defined by an energy function on data space. To sample from this posterior, we introduce a diffusion process on Lie groups that keeps all updates on-manifold and only requires computations in the associated Lie algebra. Our method, Transformation-Inverting Energy Diffusion (TIED), relies on a new trivialized target-score identity that enables efficient score-based sampling of the transformation posterior. As a key application, we focus on test-time equivariance, where the objective is to improve the robustness of pretrained neural networks to input transformations.

However, theoretical insights regarding when and why MARL outperforms Single-Agent RL (SARL) remain limited, creating uncertainty in selecting the appropriate RL framework. In this paper, we address this critical gap by rigorously analyzing the comparative sample efficiency of MARL and SARL within the context of LLM. Leveraging the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) framework, we formally define SARL and MARL setups for LLMs, derive explicit sample complexity bounds, and systematically characterize how task decomposition and alignment influence learning efficiency. Our results demonstrate that MARL improves sample complexity when tasks naturally decompose into independent subtasks, whereas dependent subtasks diminish MARL's comparative advantage. Additionally, we introduce and analyze the concept of task alignment, quantifying the trade-offs when enforcing independent task decomposition despite potential misalignments.

We argue that average sensitivity has two key limitations: it lacks a natural generalization to real-valued domains and fails to explain the \"junta-like\" input dependence we empirically observe in modern LLMs. To address these limitations, we propose noise stability as a more comprehensive simplicity metric. Noise stability expresses a model's robustness to correlated noise applied to all input coordinates simultaneously. We provide a theoretical analysis of noise stability for single-layer attention and ReLU MLP layers and tackle the multi-layer propagation problem with a covariance interval propagation approach. Building on this theory, we develop a practical noise stability regularization method. Experiments on algorithmic and next-token-prediction tasks show that our regularizer consistently catalyzes grokking and accelerates training by approximately $35\\%$ and $75\\%$ respectively.

By dynamically assessing trust scores based on fac-tors such as data quality, model accuracy, consistency, and contribution fre-quency, the system encourages honest participation and penalizes unreliable or malicious behavior. These trust scores form the basis of an incentive mechanism that rewards high-trust nodes with greater participation opportunities and penal-ties for low-trust participants.

We investigate three testing regimes: (1) test data drawn from the same distribution as the training data, in which case grokking is not observed; (2) test data concentrated around the margin, in which case grokking is observed; and (3) adversarial test data generated via projected gradient descent (PGD) attacks, in which case grokking is also observed. We theoretically show that the implicit bias of gradient descent induces a three-phase learning process-population-dominated, support-vector-dominated unlearning, and support-vector-dominated generalization-during which delayed generalization can arise. Our analysis further relates the emergence of grokking to asymmetries in the data, both in the number of examples per class and in the distribution of support vectors across classes, and yields a characterization of the grokking time. We experimentally validate our theory by planting different distributions of population points and support vectors, and by analyzing accuracy curves and hyperplane dynamics. Overall, our results demonstrate that grokking does not require depth or representation learning, and can emerge even in linear models through the dynamics of the bias term.",

The root cause of this limitation stems from the Semantic Entanglement problem in these extended workflows. In standard textual backpropagation, feedback signals mix local critiques with upstream contexts, leading to Attribution Ambiguity. To address this challenge, we propose TextResNet, a framework that reformulates the optimization process to achieve precise signal routing via four key innovations. Firstly, in the forward pass, it enforces Additive Semantic Deltas to preserve an Identity Highway for gradient flow. Secondly, in the backward pass, it introduces Semantic Gradient Decomposition via a Semantic Projector to disentangle feedback into causally independent subspaces. Thirdly, it implements Causal Routing, which routes projected signals to their specific components. Finally, it performs Density-Aware Optimization Scheduling to leverage the disentangled signals to dynamically allocate resources to key system bottlenecks. Our results show that TextResNet not only achieves superior performance compared to TextGrad, but also exhibits remarkable stability for agentic tasks in compound AI systems where baselines collapse.

While prior work on IGL provides efficient algorithms with provable guarantees, those results are confined to single-step settings, restricting their applicability to modern sequential decision-making systems such as multi-turn Large Language Model (LLM) deployments. To bridge this gap, we propose a computationally efficient algorithm that achieves a sublinear regret guarantee for contextual episodic Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with personalized feedback. Technically, we extend the reward-estimator construction of Zhang et al.

Building on this estimator, we design an Inverse-Gap-Weighting (IGW) algorithm for policy optimization.

Therefore, it is crucial to design an algorithm that accelerates each individual test. To this end, we propose the Flow Matching-based Conditional Independence Test (FMCIT). The proposed test leverages the high computational efficiency of flow matching and requires the model to be trained only once throughout the entire causal discovery procedure, substantially accelerating causal discovery. According to numerical experiments, FMCIT effectively controls type-I error and maintains high testing power under the alternative hypothesis, even in the presence of high-dimensional conditioning sets. In addition, we further integrate FMCIT into a two-stage guided PC skeleton learning framework, termed GPC-FMCIT, which combines fast screening with guided, budgeted refinement using FMCIT. This design yields explicit bounds on the number of CI queries while maintaining high statistical power. Experiments on synthetic and real-world causal discovery tasks demonstrate favorable accuracy-efficiency trade-offs over existing CI testing methods and PC variants.",

Existing CoT compression methods often suffer from a critical loss of logical fidelity at high compression ratios, resulting in significant performance degradation. To achieve high-fidelity, fast reasoning, we propose a novel EXTreme-RAtio Chain-of-Thought Compression framework, termed Extra-CoT, which aggressively reduces the token budget while preserving answer accuracy. To generate reliable, high-fidelity supervision, we first train a dedicated semantically-preserved compressor on mathematical CoT data with fine-grained annotations. An LLM is then fine-tuned on these compressed pairs via a mixed-ratio supervised fine-tuning (SFT), teaching it to follow a spectrum of compression budgets and providing a stable initialization for reinforcement learning (RL). We further propose Constrained and Hierarchical Ratio Policy Optimization (CHRPO) to explicitly incentivize question-solving ability under lower budgets by a hierarchical reward. Experiments on three mathematical reasoning benchmarks show the superiority of Extra-CoT. For example, on MATH-500 using Qwen3-1.7B, Extra-CoT achieves over 73\\% token reduction with an accuracy improvement of 0.6\\%, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.",

        "abstract": "A core bottleneck in large language model (LLM) inference is the cost of attending over the ever-growing key-value (KV) cache. Although near-oracle top-k KV selection can preserve the quality of dense attention while sharply reducing computation and bandwidth, existing sparse methods generally rely on posterior heuristics, i.e., selectors conditioned on observed attention or proxy scores. Such conditioning introduces posterior bias: it tends to distort true token importance and miss salient tokens, thereby impairing long-range reasoning. To tackle this problem, we propose Pre-hoc Sparsity (PrHS), which selects KV entries before attention scoring and provides explicit accuracy control. Let the attention mass of discarded entries be delta (the dropped mass). Through a marginal-to-mutual-information analysis, we derive an upper bound on the mutual-information loss that depends only on the dropped mass. This relation explains failure modes of posterior heuristics and enables verifiable guarantees by controlling the dropped mass in advance. Within PrHS, we instantiate three orthogonal pre-hoc selectors along the axes of time, depth, and layer. Extensive experiments on LLaMA and Mistral families validate PrHS. Across GSM8K and CoQA, PrHS reduces retrieval overhead by over 90%, achieving 3x higher retrieval sparsity than HShare at matched or better accuracy. It incurs under 1% average degradation on LongBench, lowers attention FLOPs by about 15% versus prior sparse baselines, and yields a 9.9x speedup in attention-operator latency and 2.8x higher throughput on NVIDIA A100-80GB GPUs than the dense baseline.",

In ReLU-based models, the activation pattern induced by a given input determines the piecewise-linear region in which the network behaves affinely. Motivated by this geometry, we investigate whether training exhibits a two-timescale behavior: an early stage with substantial changes in activation patterns and a later stage where weight updates predominantly refine the model within largely stable activation regimes. We first prove a local stability property: outside measure-zero sets of parameters and inputs, sufficiently small parameter perturbations preserve the activation pattern of a fixed input, implying locally affine behavior within activation regions. We then empirically track per-iteration changes in weights and activation patterns across fully-connected and convolutional architectures, as well as Transformer-based models, where activation patterns are recorded in the ReLU feed-forward (MLP/FFN) submodules, using fixed validation subsets. Across the evaluated settings, activation-pattern changes decay 3 times earlier than weight-update magnitudes, showing that late-stage training often proceeds within relatively stable activation regimes. These findings provide a concrete, architecture-agnostic instrument for monitoring training dynamics and motivate further study of decoupled optimization strategies for piecewise-linear networks. For reproducibility, code and experiment configurations will be released upon acceptance.",

First, on multi-key retrieval, ManifoldKV reduces directional collisions, achieving 92.4% vs KeyDiff's 77.0% (+15.4 points) on 3-key NIAH at 50% compression. Second, to address dilution and performance collapse of global centroids at 64K context, we introduce WindowedManifoldKV, which restores accuracy to 84.3% at 25% compression, a 49-point recovery over global L2 and +3.2 points over KeyDiff.

We introduce JoBS, an approach that uses a scaling-law-inspired performance predictor to aid Bayesian optimization (BO) in jointly optimizing LLM training data and model configurations efficiently. JoBS allocates a portion of the optimization budget to learn an LLM performance predictor that predicts how promising a training configuration is from a small number of training steps. The remaining budget is used to perform BO entirely with the predictor, effectively amortizing the cost of running full-training runs. We study JoBS's average regret and devise the optimal budget allocation to minimize regret.

To address this, we build on the discounted-to-dynamic reduction and present a modular way to obtain dynamic regret bounds of FTRL-related problems. Specifically, we focus on two representative curved losses: linear regression and logistic regression. Our method not only simplifies existing proofs for the optimal dynamic regret of online linear regression, but also yields new dynamic regret guarantees for online logistic regression. Beyond online convex optimization, we apply the reduction to analyze the Adam optimizers, obtaining optimal convergence rates in stochastic, non-convex, and non-smooth settings. The reduction also enables a more detailed treatment of Adam with two discount parameters $(\\beta_1,\\beta_2)$, leading to new results for both clipped and clip-free variants of Adam optimizers.",

        "abstract": "Addressing the critical need for robust safety in Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly against adversarial attacks and in-distribution errors, we introduce Reinforcement Learning with Backtracking Feedback (RLBF). This framework advances upon prior methods, such as BSAFE, by primarily leveraging a Reinforcement Learning (RL) stage where models learn to dynamically correct their own generation errors. Through RL with critic feedback on the model's live outputs, LLMs are trained to identify and recover from their actual, emergent safety violations by emitting an efficient \"backtrack by x tokens\" signal, then continuing generation autoregressively. This RL process is crucial for instilling resilience against sophisticated adversarial strategies, including middle filling, Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) attacks, and decoding parameter manipulations. To further support the acquisition of this backtracking capability, we also propose an enhanced Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) data generation strategy (BSAFE+). This method improves upon previous data creation techniques by injecting violations into coherent, originally safe text, providing more effective initial training for the backtracking mechanism. Comprehensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that RLBF significantly reduces attack success rates across diverse benchmarks and model scales, achieving superior safety outcomes while critically preserving foundational model utility.",

We show that any $C^2$ function that is both radial and additively separable must be quadratic, establishing a fundamental obstruction for coordinate-wise power-law models. Motivated by this result, we introduce Radial Müntz-Szász Networks (RMN), which represent fields as linear combinations of learnable radial powers $r^\\mu$, including negative exponents, together with a limit-stable log-primitive for exact $\\log r$ behavior. RMN admits closed-form spatial gradients and Laplacians, enabling physics-informed learning on punctured domains. Across ten 2D and 3D benchmarks, RMN achieves 1.5$\\times$--51$\\times$ lower RMSE than MLPs and 10$\\times$--100$\\times$ lower RMSE than SIREN while using 27 parameters, compared with 33,537 for MLPs and 8,577 for SIREN. We extend RMN to angular dependence (RMN-Angular) and to multiple sources with learnable centers (RMN-MC); when optimization converges, source-center recovery errors fall below $10^{-4}$.

        "abstract": "SF-GDA is pivotal for privacy-preserving knowledge transfer across graph datasets. Although recent works incorporate structural information, they implicitly condition adaptation on the smoothness priors of sourcetrained GNNs, thereby limiting their generalization to structurally distinct targets. This dependency becomes a critical bottleneck under significant topological shifts, where the source model misinterprets distinct topological patterns unseen in the source domain as noise, rendering pseudo-label-based adaptation unreliable. To overcome this limitation, we propose the Universal Structural Basis Distillation, a framework that shifts the paradigm from adapting a biased model to learning a universal structural basis for SF-GDA. Instead of adapting a biased source model to a specific target, our core idea is to construct a structure-agnostic basis that proactively covers the full spectrum of potential topological patterns. Specifically, USBD employs a bi-level optimization framework to distill the source dataset into a compact structural basis. By enforcing the prototypes to span the full Dirichlet energy spectrum, the learned basis explicitly captures diverse topological motifs, ranging from low-frequency clusters to high-frequency chains, beyond those present in the source. This ensures that the learned basis creates a comprehensive structural covering capable of handling targets with disparate structures. For inference, we introduce a spectral-aware ensemble mechanism that dynamically activates the optimal prototype combination based on the spectral fingerprint of the target graph. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that USBD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in scenarios with severe structural shifts, while achieving superior computational efficiency by decoupling the adaptation cost from the target data scale.",

        "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) is a decentralized learning paradigm widely adopted in resource-constrained Internet of Things (IoT) environments. These devices, typically relying on TinyML models, collaboratively train global models by sharing gradients with a central server while preserving data privacy. However, as data heterogeneity and task complexity increase, TinyML models often become insufficient to capture intricate patterns, especially under extreme non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed) conditions. Moreover, ensuring robustness against malicious clients and poisoned updates remains a major challenge. Accordingly, this paper introduces RIFLE - a Robust, distillation-based Federated Learning framework that replaces gradient sharing with logit-based knowledge transfer. By leveraging a knowledge distillation aggregation scheme, RIFLE enables the training of deep models such as VGG-19 and Resnet18 within constrained IoT systems. Furthermore, a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence-based validation mechanism quantifies the reliability of client updates without exposing raw data, achieving high trust and privacy preservation simultaneously. Experiments on three benchmark datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100) under heterogeneous non-IID conditions demonstrate that RIFLE reduces false-positive detections by up to 87.5%, enhances poisoning attack mitigation by 62.5%, and achieves up to 28.3% higher accuracy compared to conventional federated learning baselines within only 10 rounds. Notably, RIFLE reduces VGG19 training time from over 600 days to just 1.39 hours on typical IoT devices (0.3 GFLOPS), making deep learning practical in resource-constrained networks.",

To address this, we define EU as disagreement among models trained with varying relaxations of the i.i.d. assumption between training and test data. Based on this idea, we propose CreDRO, which learns an ensemble of plausible models through distributionally robust optimization. As a result, CreDRO captures EU not only from training randomness but also from meaningful disagreement due to potential distribution shifts between training and test data. Empirical results show that CreDRO consistently outperforms existing credal methods on tasks such as out-of-distribution detection across multiple benchmarks and selective classification in medical applications.",

The architecture is deliberately minimal, consisting of one self-attention layer with a single query per prediction and one feedforward layer, resulting in linear computational complexity in sequence length and a small parameter count. Numerical experiments demonstrate that TD-TF matches the performance of strong linear baselines on near-linear systems, while significantly outperforming them in nonlinear and chaotic regimes, where it accurately captures long-term dynamics. Validation studies on synthetic signals, unsteady aerodynamics, the Lorenz '63 system, and a reaction-diffusion model show that TD-TF preserves the interpretability and efficiency of linear models while providing substantially enhanced expressive power for complex dynamics.",

We adopt a simple philosophical view, robust reasoning should remain useful beyond the mind that produced it, and treat reasoning as a form of meaning transfer that must survive truncation, reinterpretation, and continuation. Building on this principle, we introduce Reinforcement Learning with Transferable Reward (RLTR), which operationalizes robustness via transfer reward that tests whether a partial reasoning prefix from one model can guide a separate model to the correct answer. This encourages LLMs to produce reasoning that is stable, interpretable, and genuinely generalizable. Our approach improves sampling consistency while improving final answer accuracy, and it reaches comparable performance in substantially fewer training steps. For example, on MATH500, RLTR achieves a +3.6%p gain in Maj@64 compared to RLVR and matches RLVR's average accuracy with roughly 2.5x fewer training steps, providing both more reliable reasoning and significantly more sample efficient.",

However, existing RLVR methods utilize rollouts in an indiscriminate and short-horizon manner: responses of heterogeneous quality within each prompt are treated uniformly, and historical rollouts are discarded after a single use. This leads to noisy supervision, poor sample efficiency, and suboptimal policy updates. We address these issues by formulating rollout scheduling in RLVR as a contextual bandit problem and proposing a unified neural scheduling framework that adaptively selects high-value rollouts throughout training. Each rollout is treated as an arm whose reward is defined by the induced performance gain between consecutive optimization steps. The resulting scheduler supports both noise-aware intra-group selection and adaptive global reuse of historical rollouts within a single principled framework. We provide theoretical justification by deriving sublinear regret bounds and showing that enlarging the rollout buffer improves the achievable performance upper bound. Experiments on six mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate consistent gains in performance and training efficiency across multiple RLVR optimization methods.",

        "abstract": "Meta-path-based heterogeneous graph neural networks aggregate over meta-path-induced views, and their semantic-level attention over meta-path channels is widely used as a narrative for ``which semantics matter.'' We study this assumption empirically by asking: when does meta-path attention reflect meta-path importance, and when can it decouple? A key challenge is that most post-hoc GNN explainers are designed for homogeneous graphs, and naive adaptations to heterogeneous neighborhoods can mix semantics and confound perturbations. To enable a controlled empirical analysis, we introduce MetaXplain, a meta-path-aware post-hoc explanation protocol that applies existing explainers in the native meta-path view domain via (i) view-factorized explanations, (ii) schema-valid channel-wise perturbations, and (iii) fusion-aware attribution, without modifying the underlying predictor. We benchmark representative gradient-, perturbation-, and Shapley-style explainers on ACM, DBLP, and IMDB with HAN and HAN-GCN, comparing against xPath and type-matched random baselines under standard faithfulness metrics. To quantify attention reliability, we propose Meta-Path Attention--Explanation Alignment (MP-AEA), which measures rank correlation between learned attention weights and explanation-derived meta-path contribution scores across random runs. Our results show that meta-path-aware explanations typically outperform random controls, while MP-AEA reveals both high-alignment and statistically significant decoupling regimes depending on the dataset and backbone; moreover, retraining on explanation-induced subgraphs often preserves, and in some noisy regimes improves, predictive performance, suggesting an explanation-as-denoising effect.",

Despite its significance in industrial applications such as fraud detection and user segmentation, a significant chasm persists between academic research and real-world deployment. Current evaluation protocols suffer from the small-scale, high-homophily citation datasets, non-scalable full-batch training paradigms, and a reliance on supervised metrics that fail to reflect performance in label-scarce environments. To bridge these gaps, we present PyAGC, a comprehensive, production-ready benchmark and library designed to stress-test AGC methods across diverse scales and structural properties. We unify existing methodologies into a modular Encode-Cluster-Optimize framework and, for the first time, provide memory-efficient, mini-batch implementations for a wide array of state-of-the-art AGC algorithms. Our benchmark curates 12 diverse datasets, ranging from 2.7K to 111M nodes, specifically incorporating industrial graphs with complex tabular features and low homophily. Furthermore, we advocate for a holistic evaluation protocol that mandates unsupervised structural metrics and efficiency profiling alongside traditional supervised metrics. Battle-tested in high-stakes industrial workflows at Ant Group, this benchmark offers the community a robust, reproducible, and scalable platform to advance AGC research towards realistic deployment.

While effective for in-distribution tasks, we argue that these deterministic paths become brittle under causal interventions, which often require transporting probability mass across low-density regions (\"off-manifold\") where the vector field is ill-defined. This leads to numerical instability and spurious correlations. In this work, we introduce the Causal Schrödinger Bridge (CSB), a framework that reformulates counterfactual inference as Entropic Optimal Transport. Unlike deterministic approaches that require strict invertibility, CSB leverages diffusion processes (SDEs) to robustly \"tunnel\" through support mismatches while strictly enforcing structural admissibility constraints. We prove the Structural Decomposition Theorem, showing that the global high-dimensional bridge factorizes into local, robust transitions. Empirical validation on high-dimensional interventions (Morpho-MNIST) demonstrates that CSB significantly outperforms deterministic baselines in structural consistency, particularly in regimes of strong, out-of-distribution treatments.",

We challenge this assumption by introducing implicit memory-the ability of a model to carry state across otherwise independent interactions by encoding information in its own outputs and later recovering it when those outputs are reintroduced as input. This mechanism does not require any explicit memory module, yet it creates a persistent information channel across inference requests. As a concrete demonstration, we introduce a new class of temporal backdoors, which we call time bombs. Unlike conventional backdoors that activate on a single trigger input, time bombs activate only after a sequence of interactions satisfies hidden conditions accumulated via implicit memory. We show that such behavior can be induced today through straightforward prompting or fine-tuning. Beyond this case study, we analyze broader implications of implicit memory, including covert inter-agent communication, benchmark contamination, targeted manipulation, and training-data poisoning. Finally, we discuss detection challenges and outline directions for stress-testing and evaluation, with the goal of anticipating and controlling future developments.

Model merging offers a compelling alternative by directly integrating the weights of multiple source models without requiring additional data or extensive training. However, conventional model merging techniques, such as parameter averaging, often suffer from the unintended combination of non-generalizable features, especially when source models exhibit significant weight disparities. Comparatively, model ensembling generally provides more stable and superior performance that aggregates multiple models by averaging outputs. However, it incurs higher inference costs and increased storage requirements. While previous studies experimentally showed the similarities between model merging and ensembling, theoretical evidence and evaluation metrics remain lacking. To address this gap, we introduce Merging-ensembling loss (M-Loss), a novel evaluation metric that quantifies the compatibility of merging source models using very limited unlabeled data. By measuring the discrepancy between parameter averaging and model ensembling at layer and node levels, M-Loss facilitates more effective merging strategies. Specifically, M-Loss serves both as a quantitative criterion of the theoretical feasibility of model merging, and a guide for parameter significance in model pruning. Our theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations demonstrate that incorporating M-Loss into the merging process significantly improves the alignment between merged models and model ensembling, providing a scalable and efficient framework for accurate model consolidation.",

In this research effort an optimization of the k-NN algorithm is proposed by exploiting the potentiality of an introduced arithmetic method, which can provide solutions for linear equations involving an arbitrary number of real variables. Specifically, an Arithmetic Method Algorithm (AMA) is adopted to assess the efficiency of the introduced arithmetic method, while an Arithmetic Method Regression (AMR) algorithm is proposed as an optimization of k-NN adopting the potentiality of AMA. Such algorithm is compared with other regression algorithms, according to an introduced optimal inference decision rule, and evaluated on certain real world data sources, which are publicly available. Results are promising since the proposed AMR algorithm has comparable performance with the other algorithms, while in most cases it achieves better performance than the k-NN. The output results indicate that introduced AMR is an optimization of k-NN.",

Under a simplified setting, we utilize this framework to interpret the robustness of generative models through the lens of geometric stability and displacement convexity.

However, most existing offline safe RL methods are trained under a pre-specified threshold, yielding policies with limited generalization and deployment flexibility across cost thresholds. Motivated by recent progress in conditional sequence modeling (CSM), which enables flexible goal-conditioned control by specifying target returns, we propose RCDT, a CSM-based method that supports zero-shot deployment across multiple cost thresholds within a single trained policy. RCDT is the first CSM-based offline safe RL algorithm that integrates a Lagrangian-style cost penalty with an auto-adaptive penalty coefficient. To avoid overly conservative behavior and achieve a more favorable return--cost trade-off, a reward--cost-aware trajectory reweighting mechanism and Q-value regularization are further incorporated. Extensive experiments on the DSRL benchmark demonstrate that RCDT consistently improves return--cost trade-offs over representative baselines, advancing the state-of-the-art in offline safe RL.",

Current KV cache eviction methods typically rely on instantaneous heuristic metrics, implicitly assuming that score magnitudes are consistent proxies for importance across all heads. However, this overlooks the heterogeneity in predictive fidelity across attention heads. While certain heads prioritize the instantaneous contribution of tokens, others are dedicated to capturing long-horizon utility. In this paper, we propose that optimal budget allocation should be governed by the marginal utility in preserving long-term semantic information. Based on this insight, we propose LU-KV, a novel framework that optimizes head-level budget allocation through a convex-hull relaxation and a marginal-utility-based greedy solver to achieve near-optimal precision. Furthermore, we implement a data-driven offline profiling protocol to facilitate the practical deployment of LU-KV. Extensive evaluations on LongBench and RULER benchmarks demonstrate that LU-KV achieves an 80% reduction in KV cache size with minimal performance degradation, while simultaneously reducing inference latency and GPU memory footprint.",

In order to overcome these shortcomings, we put forth a unified in-processing convex optimization framework, termed FairRARI, for tackling different group-fairness criteria in a ``plug and play'' fashion. Leveraging a variational formulation of PR, the framework computes fair PR vectors by solving a strongly convex optimization problem with fairness constraints, thereby ensuring that a target fairness level is achieved. We further introduce three different fairness criteria which can be efficiently tackled using FairRARI to compute fair PR vectors with the same asymptotic time-complexity as the original PR algorithm.

Federated prompt learning mitigates this issue by keeping the VLPM backbone frozen and collaboratively training lightweight prompt parameters. However, existing approaches typically enforce a unified prompt structure and length across clients, which is inadequate under practical client heterogeneity in both data distributions and system resources, and may further introduce conflicts between globally shared and locally optimal knowledge. To address these challenges, we propose \\textbf{SDFed}, a heterogeneous federated prompt learning framework that bridges Local-Global Discrepancy via Subspace Refinement and Divergence Control. SDFed maintains a fixed-length global prompt for efficient aggregation while allowing each client to learn a variable-length local prompt to better match its data characteristics and capacity. To mitigate local-global conflicts and facilitate effective knowledge transfer, SDFed introduces a subspace refinement method for local prompts and an information retention and divergence control strategy that preserves key local information while maintaining appropriate separability between global and local representations.

        "abstract": "Link prediction is a fundamental task in graph machine learning with widespread applications such as recommendation systems, drug discovery, knowledge graphs, etc. In the foundation model era, how to develop universal link prediction methods across datasets and domains becomes a key problem, with some initial attempts adopting Graph Foundation Models utilizing Graph Neural Networks and Large Language Models. However, the existing methods face notable limitations, including limited pre-training scale or heavy reliance on textual information. Motivated by the success of tabular foundation models (TFMs) in achieving universal prediction across diverse tabular datasets, we explore an alternative approach by TFMs, which are pre-trained on diverse synthetic datasets sampled from structural causal models and support strong in-context learning independent of textual attributes. Nevertheless, adapting TFMs for link prediction faces severe technical challenges such as how to obtain the necessary context and capture link-centric topological information. To solve these challenges, we propose TFMLinker (Tabular Foundation Model for Link Predictor), aiming to leverage the in-context learning capabilities of TFMs to perform link prediction across diverse graphs without requiring dataset-specific fine-tuning. Specifically, we first develop a prototype-augmented local-global context module to construct context that captures both graph-specific and cross-graph transferable patterns. Next, we design a universal topology-aware link encoder to capture link-centric topological information and generate link representations as inputs for the TFM. Finally, we employ the TFM to predict link existence through in-context learning. Experiments on 6 graph benchmarks across diverse domains demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art baselines without requiring dataset-specific finetuning.",

Existing algorithms typically rely on restrictive grid-based structures or computationally expensive nearest-neighbor searches, limiting their effectiveness in high-dimensional or irregularly structured domains. We propose Distance-Guided Reinforcement Learning (DGRL), combining Sampled Dynamic Neighborhoods (SDN) and Distance-Based Updates (DBU) to enable efficient RL in spaces with up to 10$^\\text{20}$ actions. Unlike prior methods, SDN leverages a semantic embedding space to perform stochastic volumetric exploration, provably providing full support over a local trust region. Complementing this, DBU transforms policy optimization into a stable regression task, decoupling gradient variance from action space cardinality and guaranteeing monotonic policy improvement. DGRL naturally generalizes to hybrid continuous-discrete action spaces without requiring hierarchical dependencies. We demonstrate performance improvements of up to 66% against state-of-the-art benchmarks across regularly and irregularly structured environments, while simultaneously improving convergence speed and computational complexity.",

We theoretically prove that ERIS (i) converges at the same rate as FedAvg under standard assumptions, and (ii) bounds mutual information leakage inversely with the number of aggregators, enabling strong privacy guarantees with no accuracy degradation.

        "abstract": "By introducing routers to selectively activate experts in Transformer layers, the mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture significantly reduces computational costs in large language models (LLMs) while maintaining competitive performance, especially for models with massive parameters. However, prior work has largely focused on utility and efficiency, leaving the safety risks associated with this sparse architecture underexplored. In this work, we show that the safety of MoE LLMs is as sparse as their architecture by discovering unsafe routes: routing configurations that, once activated, convert safe outputs into harmful ones. Specifically, we first introduce the Router Safety importance score (RoSais) to quantify the safety criticality of each layer's router. Manipulation of only the high-RoSais router(s) can flip the default route into an unsafe one. For instance, on JailbreakBench, masking 5 routers in DeepSeek-V2-Lite increases attack success rate (ASR) by over 4$\\times$ to 0.79, highlighting an inherent risk that router manipulation may naturally occur in MoE LLMs. We further propose a Fine-grained token-layer-wise Stochastic Optimization framework to discover more concrete Unsafe Routes (F-SOUR), which explicitly considers the sequentiality and dynamics of input tokens. Across four representative MoE LLM families, F-SOUR achieves an average ASR of 0.90 and 0.98 on JailbreakBench and AdvBench, respectively. Finally, we outline defensive perspectives, including safety-aware route disabling and router training, as promising directions to safeguard MoE LLMs. We hope our work can inform future red-teaming and safeguarding of MoE LLMs. Our code is provided in this https URL.",

CauScale improves time efficiency via a reduction unit that compresses data embeddings and improves space efficiency by adopting tied attention weights to avoid maintaining axis-specific attention maps. To keep high causal discovery accuracy, CauScale adopts a two-stream design: a data stream extracts relational evidence from high-dimensional observations, while a graph stream integrates statistical graph priors and preserves key structural signals. CauScale successfully scales to 500-node graphs during training, where prior work fails due to space limitations. Across testing data with varying graph scales and causal mechanisms, CauScale achieves 99.6% mAP on in-distribution data and 84.4% on out-of-distribution data, while delivering 4-13,000 times inference speedups over prior methods.

        "abstract": "As a fundamental data mining task, unsupervised time series anomaly detection (TSAD) aims to build a model for identifying abnormal timestamps without assuming the availability of annotations. A key challenge in unsupervised TSAD is that many anomalies are too subtle to exhibit detectable deviation in any single view (e.g., time domain), and instead manifest as inconsistencies across multiple views like time, frequency, and a mixture of resolutions. However, most cross-view methods rely on feature or score fusion and do not enforce analysis-synthesis consistency, meaning the frequency branch is not required to reconstruct the time signal through an inverse transform, and vice versa. In this paper, we present Learnable Fusion of Tri-view Tokens (LEFT), a unified unsupervised TSAD framework that models anomalies as inconsistencies across complementary representations. LEFT learns feature tokens from three views of the same input time series: frequency-domain tokens that embed periodicity information, time-domain tokens that capture local dynamics, and multi-scale tokens that learns abnormal patterns at varying time series granularities. By learning a set of adaptive Nyquist-constrained spectral filters, the original time series is rescaled into multiple resolutions and then encoded, allowing these multi-scale tokens to complement the extracted frequency- and time-domain information. When generating the fused representation, we introduce a novel objective that reconstructs fine-grained targets from coarser multi-scale structure, and put forward an innovative time-frequency cycle consistency constraint to explicitly regularize cross-view agreement. Experiments on real-world benchmarks show that LEFT yields the best detection accuracy against SOTA baselines, while achieving a 5x reduction on FLOPs and 8x speed-up for training.",

Test-time latent optimization can unlock substantially better reward-guided generations from pretrained generative models, but it is prone to reward hacking that degrades quality and also too slow for practical use. In this work, we make test-time optimization both efficient and reliable by replacing soft regularization with hard white Gaussian noise constraints enforced via projected gradient ascent. Our method applies a closed-form projection after each update to keep the latent vector explicitly noise-like throughout optimization, preventing the drift that leads to unrealistic artifacts. This enforcement adds minimal cost: the projection matches the $O(N \\log N)$ complexity of standard algorithms such as sorting or FFT and does not practically increase wall-clock time. In experiments, our approach reaches a comparable Aesthetic Score using only 30% of the wall-clock time required by the SOTA regularization-based method, while preventing reward hacking.",

Methods like CQL offers rigorous conservatism but require tremendous compute power while efficient expectile-based methods like IQL often fail to correct OOD errors on pathological datasets, collapsing to Behavioural Cloning. In this work, we propose Geometric Pessimism, a modular, compute-efficient framework that augments standard IQL with density-based penalty derived from k-nearest-neighbour distances in the state-action embedding space. By pre-computing the penalties applied to each state-action pair our method injects OOD conservatism via reward shaping with a O(1) training overhead. Evaluated on the D4Rl MuJoCo benchmark, our method, Geo-IQL outperforms standard IQL on sensitive and unstable medium-replay tasks by over 18 points, while reducing inter-seed variance by 4x. Furthermore, Geo-IQL does not degrade performance on stable manifolds. Crucially, we validate our algorithm on the MIMIC-III Sepsis critical care dataset. While standard IQL collapses to behaviour cloning, Geo-IQL demonstrates active policy improvement.

Although some studies address prediction performance guarantees, their single-stage synthesis designs make it challenging to balance the privacy requirements that necessitate significant perturbations and the prediction performance that is sensitive to such perturbations. We propose a two-stage synthesis strategy. In the first stage, we introduce a synthesis-then-hybrid strategy, which involves a synthesis operation to generate pure synthetic data, followed by a hybrid operation that fuses the synthetic data with the original data. In the second stage, we present a kernel ridge regression (KRR)-based synthesis strategy, where a KRR model is first trained on the original data and then used to generate synthetic outputs based on the synthetic inputs produced in the first stage. By leveraging the theoretical strengths of KRR and the covariant distribution retention achieved in the first stage, our proposed two-stage synthesis strategy enables a statistics-driven restricted privacy--prediction trade-off and guarantee optimal prediction performance. We validate our approach and demonstrate its characteristics of being statistics-driven and restricted in achieving the privacy--prediction trade-off both theoretically and numerically.

Existing fairness notions for generative models are largely adapted from classification and focus on balancing the probability of generating samples from each sensitive group. We show that such criteria are brittle, as they can be met even when different sensitive groups are modeled with widely varying quality. To address this limitation, we introduce a new fairness definition for generative models, termed as equalized generative treatment (EGT), which requires comparable generation quality across all sensitive groups, with quality measured via a reference f-divergence. We further analyze the trade-offs induced by EGT, demonstrating that enforcing fairness constraints necessarily couples the overall model quality to that of the most challenging group to approximate. This indicates that a simple yet efficient min-max fine-tuning method should be able to balance f-divergences across sensitive groups to satisfy EGT. We validate this theoretical insight through a set of experiments on both image and text generation tasks. We demonstrate that min-max methods consistently achieve fairer outcomes compared to other approaches from the literature, while maintaining competitive overall performance for both tasks.",

Today, we unveil LLaDA2.1, a paradigm shift designed to transcend this trade-off. By seamlessly weaving Token-to-Token (T2T) editing into the conventional Mask-to-Token (M2T) scheme, we introduce a joint, configurable threshold-decoding scheme. This structural innovation gives rise to two distinct personas: the Speedy Mode (S Mode), which audaciously lowers the M2T threshold to bypass traditional constraints while relying on T2T to refine the output; and the Quality Mode (Q Mode), which leans into conservative thresholds to secure superior benchmark performances with manageable efficiency degrade. Furthering this evolution, underpinned by an expansive context window, we implement the first large-scale Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework specifically tailored for dLLMs, anchored by specialized techniques for stable gradient estimation. This alignment not only sharpens reasoning precision but also elevates instruction-following fidelity, bridging the chasm between diffusion dynamics and complex human intent. We culminate this work by releasing LLaDA2.1-Mini (16B) and LLaDA2.1-Flash (100B). Across 33 rigorous benchmarks, LLaDA2.1 delivers strong task performance and lightning-fast decoding speed.

        "abstract": "Score-based query attacks pose a serious threat to deep learning models by crafting adversarial examples (AEs) using only black-box access to model output scores, iteratively optimizing inputs based on observed loss values. While recent runtime defenses attempt to disrupt this process via output perturbation, most either require access to model parameters or fail when attackers adapt their tactics. In this paper, we first reveal that even the state-of-the-art plug-and-play defense can be bypassed by adaptive attacks, exposing a critical limitation of existing runtime defenses. We then propose Dashed Line Defense (DLD), a plug-and-play post-processing method specifically designed to withstand adaptive query strategies. By introducing ambiguity in how the observed loss reflects the true adversarial strength of candidate examples, DLD prevents attackers from reliably analyzing and adapting their queries, effectively disrupting the AE generation process. We provide theoretical guarantees of DLD's defense capability and validate its effectiveness through experiments on ImageNet, demonstrating that DLD consistently outperforms prior defenses--even under worst-case adaptive attacks--while preserving the model's predicted labels.",

In this paper, we first investigate under which conditions we can perform constrained MAP inference over continuous variables exactly and efficiently and devise a scalable message-passing algorithm for this tractable fragment. Then, we devise a general constrained MAP strategy that interleaves partitioning the domain into convex feasible regions with numerical constrained optimization. We evaluate both methods on synthetic and real-world benchmarks, showing our % approaches outperform constraint-agnostic baselines, and scale to complex densities intractable for SoTA exact solvers.",

Existing KV compression methods rely either on static thresholds and attention-only heuristics or on coarse memory budget allocation. Under tight memory budgets, these methods overlook two key factors: prompt-dependent variation in compression risk and functional heterogeneity across attention heads, which destabilize token selection and lead to tail failures. To address these challenges, we propose CompilerKV, a risk-adaptive and head-aware compression framework that compiles offline experience into reusable decision tables for prefill-only deployment. CompilerKV integrates two key synergistic components: (i) a Head Heterogeneity Table, learned via offline contextual bandits, which assigns head-specific reliability weights to govern functional differences across attention heads explicitly; and (ii) a Risk-Adaptive Threshold Gating mechanism that jointly models attention entropy and local perplexity, transforming prompt-level risk into deployable retention thresholds. Experiments on LongBench show CompilerKV dominates SOTA methods under a 512-token budget, recovering 97.7\\% of FullKV performance while achieving up to +5.2 points gain over the strongest competitor.",

This adaptability serves as a key lever in practice, enabling improvements in both the quality of generated samples and the efficiency of the sampling process. In this work, we introduce an inverse reinforcement learning framework for learning sampling strategies without retraining the denoiser. We formulate the diffusion sampling procedure as a discrete-time finite-horizon Markov Decision Process, where actions correspond to optional modifications of the sampling dynamics. To optimize action scheduling, we avoid defining an explicit reward function. Instead, we directly match the target behavior expected from the sampler using policy gradient techniques. We provide experimental evidence that this approach can improve the quality of samples generated by pretrained diffusion models and automatically tune sampling hyperparameters.",

By analyzing 66 significant DRL4Sec papers (2018-2025), we quantify the prevalence of each pitfall and find an average of over five pitfalls per paper. We demonstrate the practical impact of these pitfalls using controlled experiments in (i) autonomous cyber defense, (ii) adversarial malware creation, and (iii) web security testing environments.

We introduce an active probabilistic reasoning task that cleanly separates sampling (actively acquiring evidence) from inference (integrating evidence toward a decision). Benchmarking humans and a broad set of contemporary large language models against near-optimal reference policies reveals a consistent pattern: extended reasoning is the key determinant of strong performance, driving large gains in inference and producing belief trajectories that become strikingly human-like, while yielding only modest improvements in active sampling. To explain these differences, we fit a mechanistic model that captures systematic deviations from optimal behavior via four interpretable latent variables: memory, strategy, choice bias, and occlusion awareness. This model places humans and models in a shared low-dimensional cognitive space, reproduces behavioral signatures across agents, and shows how chain-of-thought shifts language models toward human-like regimes of evidence accumulation and belief-to-choice mapping, tightening alignment in inference while leaving a persistent gap in information acquisition.",

Here, we study noise-robust learning: are transformers trained on data with noisy features able to find a target function that correctly predicts labels for noiseless features? We show that transformers succeed at noise-robust learning for a selection of $k$-sparse parity and majority functions, compared to LSTMs which fail at this task for even modest feature noise. However, we find that transformers typically fail at noise-robust learning of random $k$-juntas, especially when the boolean sensitivity of the optimal solution is smaller than that of the target function. We argue that this failure is due to a combination of two factors: transformers' bias toward simpler functions, combined with an observation that the optimal function for noise-robust learning typically has lower sensitivity than the target function for random boolean functions. We test this hypothesis by exploiting transformers' simplicity bias to trap them in an incorrect solution, but show that transformers can escape this trap by training with an additional loss term penalizing high-sensitivity solutions. Overall, we find that transformers are particularly ineffective for learning boolean functions in the presence of feature noise.",

While many queries focus on a smaller group of keys in the attention operator, we observe that queries with low cosine similarity with respect to the mean query interact more strongly with more keys and have the greatest contribution to final attention logits. By prioritizing these low cosine similarity queries, the behavior of full attention during the prefill stage can be closely approximated. QUOKA leverages this observation, accelerating attention by (1) first retaining a small set of representative queries and (2) then subselectin the keys most aligned with those queries. Through experiments on Needle-In-A-Haystack, LongBench, RULER, and Math500, we show that, while realizing a 3x reduction in time-to-first-token, 5x speedup in attention on Nvidia GPUs and up to nearly a 7x speedup on Intel Xeon CPUs, QUOKA achieves near-baseline accuracy, utilizing 88% fewer key-value pairs per attention evaluation.",

As our main result, we prove that the full WL hierarchy cannot, in general, distinguish between satisfiable and unsatisfiable instances. We show that indistinguishability under higher-order WL carries over to practical limitations for WL-bounded solvers that set variables sequentially. We further study the expressivity required for several important families of SAT instances, including regular, random and planar instances. To quantify expressivity needs in practice, we conduct experiments on random instances from the G4SAT benchmark and industrial instances from the International SAT Competition.

Focusing on the context of human activity recognition, we propose RALIS, a model that combines multiview contrastive learning with a mixture-of-experts module to support arbitrary view availability during both training and inference. Instead of trying to reconstruct missing views, an adjusted center contrastive loss is used for self-supervised representation learning and view alignment, mitigating the impact of missing views on multiview fusion. This loss formulation allows for the integration of view weights to account for view quality. Additionally, it reduces computational complexity from $O(V^2)$ to $O(V)$, where $V$ is the number of views. To address residual discrepancies not captured by contrastive learning, we employ a mixture-of-experts module with a specialized load balancing strategy, tasked with adapting to arbitrary view combinations. We highlight the geometric relationship among components in our model and how they combine well in the latent space.

        "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in various graph-based machine learning tasks by effectively modeling high-order interactions between nodes. However, training GNNs without protection may leak sensitive personal information in graph data, including links and node features. Local differential privacy (LDP) is an advanced technique for protecting data privacy in decentralized networks. Unfortunately, existing local differentially private GNNs either only preserve link privacy or suffer significant utility loss in the process of preserving link and node feature privacy. In this paper, we propose an effective LDP framework, called HoGS, which trains GNNs with link and feature protection by generating a synthetic graph. Concretely, HoGS first collects the link and feature information of the graph under LDP, and then utilizes the phenomenon of homophily in graph data to reconstruct the graph structure and node features separately, thereby effectively mitigating the negative impact of LDP on the downstream GNN training. We theoretically analyze the privacy guarantee of HoGS and conduct experiments using the generated synthetic graph as input to various state-of-the-art GNN architectures. Experimental results on three real-world datasets show that HoGS significantly outperforms baseline methods in the accuracy of training GNNs.",

While most BO pipelines begin with uniform random initialization, default hyperparameter values shipped with popular ML libraries such as scikit-learn encode implicit expert knowledge and could serve as informative starting points that accelerate convergence. This hypothesis, despite its intuitive appeal, has remained largely unexamined. We formalize the idea by initializing BO with points drawn from truncated Gaussian distributions centered at library defaults and compare the resulting trajectories against a uniform-random baseline. We conduct an extensive empirical evaluation spanning three BO back-ends (BoTorch, Optuna, Scikit-Optimize), three model families (Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, Multilayer Perceptrons), and five benchmark datasets covering classification and regression tasks. Performance is assessed through convergence speed and final predictive quality, and statistical significance is determined via one-sided binomial tests. Across all conditions, default-informed initialization yields no statistically significant advantage over purely random sampling, with p-values ranging from 0.141 to 0.908. A sensitivity analysis on the prior variance confirms that, while tighter concentration around the defaults improves early evaluations, this transient benefit vanishes as optimization progresses, leaving final performance unchanged. Our results provide no evidence that default hyperparameters encode useful directional information for optimization. We therefore recommend that practitioners treat hyperparameter tuning as an integral part of model development and favor principled, data-driven search strategies over heuristic reliance on library defaults.",

Yet, measuring and improving procedural validity at scale on real-world tasks remains challenging and understudied. To address this, we introduce How2Everything, a scalable framework to evaluate and improve goal-conditioned procedure generation. Our framework includes How2Mine, which mines 351K procedures from 980K web pages across 14 topics and readily scales to larger corpora. From this pool we build How2Bench, a 7K-example evaluation set balanced across topics. To reliably score model outputs, we develop How2Score, an evaluation protocol that uses an LLM judge to detect whether a generation contains any critical failure that would prevent achieving the goal. For low-cost, reproducible evaluation, we distill a frontier model into an open 8B model, achieving 80.5% agreement with human annotators. How2Bench reveals clear scaling trends across model sizes and training stages, providing signal early in pretraining. Finally, RL using How2Score as a reward improves performance on How2Bench by >10 points across three models without systematic regressions on standard benchmarks, with gains robust to superficial source-document memorization or format compliance. Taken together, How2Everything shows how pretraining web data can support a closed loop of capability evaluation and improvement at scale.",

Yet even small downstream updates can compromise earlier learned behaviors (e.g., safety), exposing a brittleness known as catastrophic forgetting. This suggests standard RLHF objectives do not guarantee robustness to future adaptation. To address it, most prior work designs downstream-time methods to preserve previously learned behaviors. We argue that preventing this requires pre-finetuning robustness: the base policy should avoid brittle high-reward solutions whose reward drops sharply under standard fine-tuning. We propose Fine-tuning Robust Policy Optimization (FRPO), a robust RLHF framework that optimizes reward not only at the current policy, but across a KL-bounded neighborhood of policies reachable by downstream adaptation. The key idea is to ensure reward stability under policy shifts via a max-min formulation. By modifying GRPO, we develop an algorithm with no extra computation, and empirically show it substantially reduces safety degradation across multiple base models and downstream fine-tuning regimes (SFT and RL) while preserving downstream task performance. We further study a math-focused RL setting, demonstrating that FRPO preserves accuracy under subsequent fine-tuning.",

Conversely, spiking neural networks (SNNs) exhibit exceptional energy efficiency due to their binary and event-driven characteristics, thus motivating the study of ANN-to-SNN conversion. In this process, quantization plays a pivotal role, mapping LLMs' floating-point parameters to discrete SNN parameters via the temporal dimension of the time window. However, several challenges remain in the conversion process: (i) converting high bit-width quantization values into binary spikes requires longer time windows, increasing system latency; and (ii) the inherent trade-off between the information loss of single-spike schemes and the energy costs of multi-spike ones in SNN. To address these challenges, we propose Kirin, a integer and spike hybrid based SNN to achieve accuracy lossless ANN-to-SNN conversion with time and energy efficiency. Specifically, we first propose a Spike Matrix Hybridization strategy that encoding low bit-width parameters that leading to small time window size into binary spikes while preserving the rest in integer format, thereby reducing the overall latency of SNN execution. Second, we introduce a silence threshold mechanism to regulate the timing of single-spike firing, ensuring the output is mathematically equivalent to the LLM's output and preserves accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that Kirin, under a W4A4\\&8 quantization setting, achieves near-FP16 accuracy while reducing energy consumption by up to 84.66\\% and shortening time steps by 93.75\\%.",

Here, we introduce FlexMoRE, a Flexible Mixture of Rank-heterogenous Experts, which may be either full-sized experts or adapters of a suitable rank. We systematically investigate the trade-off between expert rank and downstream task performance by evaluating $6$ experts with ranks $2^0$ to $2^{14}$ resulting in experiments covering 150 mixtures (96 with 2 experts, 54 with 7 experts) that are evaluated across $120$ tasks. For our experiments, we build on FlexOlmo and turn its pre-trained experts into low-rank versions. Our regression analysis from expert rank to downstream task performance reveals that the best-performing rank is substantially higher for reasoning-heavy benchmarks than for knowledge-heavy benchmarks. These findings on rank sensitivity come with direct implications for memory efficiency: Using optimal ranks, FlexMoRE yields improved downstream task performance (average score $47.18$) compared to the baseline FlexOlmo-style mixture of full-sized experts (average score $45.46$) at less than one third the parameters ($10.75$B for FlexMoRE vs. $33.27$B for FlexOlmo).

As RL is increasingly applied to settings such as verifiable rewards and multi-objective alignment, RMs are expected to encode more complex and multifaceted preference distributions. However, classifier RMs remain static once trained, limiting their adaptability at test time. We propose Variational In-Context Reward Modeling (ICRM), a novel Bayesian reward modeling objective that enables test-time steerability via in-context preference demonstrations. ICRM casts reward modeling as amortized variational inference over a latent preference probability under the Bradley-Terry model using a conjugate Beta prior. We show that ICRM adapt to unseen preference distributions at test time for both single and multi-objective settings. With more in-context demonstrations, ICRM gains 34% accuracy on SafeRLHF and 9% accuracy on RM-Bench in the single-objective setting, while widening the Pareto frontier with a 4% gain in hypervolume on helpfulness and refusal benchmarks. We further study the practical applicability of ICRM for RL training, showing that it can effectively encode verifiable rewards by outperforming a conventional RM in math reasoning. Finally, we provide theoretical guarantees that the variational objective admits a global interior optimum with finite confidence, and we analyze how KL regularization mitigates reward over-optimization.",

In this work, we theoretically pinpoint a key reason for training instability when extending group-based RL to multi-agent LLM systems. We show that under GRPO-style optimization, a global normalization baseline may deviate from diverse agents' reward distributions, which ultimately leads to gradient-norm instability. Based on this finding, we propose Dr. MAS, a simple and stable RL training recipe for multi-agent LLM systems. Dr. MAS uses an agent-wise remedy: normalizing advantages per agent using each agent's own reward statistics, which calibrates gradient scales and dramatically stabilizes training, both theoretically and empirically. Beyond the algorithm, Dr. MAS provides an end-to-end RL training framework for multi-agent LLM systems, supporting scalable orchestration, flexible per-agent LLM serving and optimization configs, and shared resource scheduling of LLM actor backends. We evaluate Dr. MAS on multi-agent math reasoning and multi-turn search benchmarks using Qwen2.5 and Qwen3 series models. Dr. MAS achieves clear gains over vanilla GRPO (e.g., +5.6\\% avg@16 and +4.6\\% pass@16 on math, and +15.2\\% avg@16 and +13.1\\% pass@16 on search) while largely eliminating gradient spikes.

In this work, we focus on a prevalent yet under-explored phenomenon in graph generalization, Minimal Shift Flip (MSF),where test samples that slightly deviate from the training distribution are abruptly misclassified. To interpret this phenomenon, we revisit MSF through the lens of Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM), which characterizes the local stability and sharpness of the loss landscape while providing a theoretical foundation for modeling generalization error. To quantify loss sharpness, we introduce the concept of Local Robust Radius, measuring the smallest perturbation required to flip a prediction and establishing a theoretical link between local stability and generalization. Building on this perspective, we further observe a continual decrease in the robust radius during training, indicating weakened local stability and an increasingly sharp loss landscape that gives rise to MSF. To jointly solve the MSF phenomenon and the intractability of radius, we develop an energy-based formulation that is theoretically proven to be monotonically correlated with the robust radius, offering a tractable and principled objective for modeling flatness and stability. Building on these insights, we propose an energy-driven generative augmentation framework (E2A) that leverages energy-guided latent perturbations to generate pseudo-OOD samples and enhance model generalization. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that E2A consistently improves graph OOD generalization, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.",

However, it remains open whether trained models actually implement simple interpretable programs. In this paper, we present a general method to extract such programs from trained Transformers. The idea is to faithfully re-parameterize a Transformer as a RASP program and then apply causal interventions to discover a small sufficient sub-program.

We prove several theoretical properties of magnitude distance, including its limiting behavior across scales and conditions under which it satisfies key metric properties. In contrast to classical distances, we show that magnitude distance remains discriminative in high-dimensional settings when the scale is appropriately tuned.

We present AnomSeer to address this by reinforcing the model to ground its reasoning in precise, structural details of time series, unifying anomaly classification, localization, and explanation. At its core, an expert chain-of-thought trace is generated to provide a verifiable, fine-grained reasoning from classical analyses (e.g., statistical measures, frequency transforms). Building on this, we propose a novel time-series grounded policy optimization (TimerPO) that incorporates two additional components beyond standard reinforcement learning: a time-series grounded advantage based on optimal transport and an orthogonal projection to ensure this auxiliary granular signal does not interfere with the primary detection objective. Across diverse anomaly scenarios, AnomSeer, with Qwen2.5-VL-3B/7B-Instruct, outperforms larger commercial baselines (e.g., GPT-4o) in classification and localization accuracy, particularly on point- and frequency-driven exceptions.

We propose SimpliPy, a rule-based simplification engine achieving a 100-fold speed-up over SymPy at comparable quality. This enables substantial improvements in amortized SR, including scalability to much larger training sets, more efficient use of the per-expression token budget, and systematic training set decontamination with respect to equivalent test expressions. We demonstrate these advantages in our Flash-ANSR framework, which achieves much better accuracy than amortized baselines (NeSymReS, E2E) on the FastSRB benchmark.

To this end, we propose a novel and effective selective memorization mitigation method -- Gated Subspace Steering (GSS), which decomposes intervention into a probe (detecting memorization-relevant activations) and a steer (applying targeted correction only when the probe exceeds a threshold). The optimal probe-steer pair emerges from a principled optimization framework based on optimal subspace steering. Experiments on four benchmarks show GSS matches or exceeds state-of-the-art memorization reduction while requiring $100-1000 \\times$ less compute than optimization-based alternatives.

In contrast, we argue that with a well-chosen D'(x), the shift can be positive and make learning easier -- a perspective called Positive Distribution Shift (PDS). Such a perspective is central to contemporary machine learning, where much of the innovation is in finding good training distributions D'(x), rather than changing the training algorithm. We further argue that the benefit is often computational rather than statistical, and that PDS allows computationally hard problems to become tractable even using standard gradient-based training.

        "abstract": "Selecting interpretable feature sets in underdetermined ($n \\ll p$) and highly correlated regimes constitutes a fundamental challenge in data science, particularly when analyzing physical measurements. In such settings, multiple distinct sparse subsets may explain the response equally well. Identifying these alternatives is crucial for generating domain-specific insights into the underlying mechanisms, yet conventional methods typically isolate a single solution, obscuring the full spectrum of plausible explanations. We present GEMSS (Gaussian Ensemble for Multiple Sparse Solutions), a variational Bayesian framework specifically designed to simultaneously discover multiple, diverse sparse feature combinations. The method employs a structured spike-and-slab prior for sparsity, a mixture of Gaussians to approximate the intractable multimodal posterior, and a Jaccard-based penalty to further control solution diversity. Unlike sequential greedy approaches, GEMSS optimizes the entire ensemble of solutions within a single objective function via stochastic gradient descent. The method is validated on a comprehensive benchmark comprising 128 synthetic experiments across classification and regression tasks. Results demonstrate that GEMSS scales effectively to high-dimensional settings ($p=5000$) with sample size as small as $n = 50$, generalizes seamlessly to continuous targets, handles missing data natively, and exhibits remarkable robustness to class imbalance and Gaussian noise. GEMSS is available as a Python package 'gemss' at PyPI. The full GitHub repository at this https URL also includes a free, easy-to-use application suitable for non-coders.",

Yet, most existing pre-trained transformers do not have a principled mechanism for uncertainty propagation through their feature transformation stack. In this work, we propose a diffusion-inspired reconfiguration of transformers in which each feature transformation block is modeled as a probabilistic mapping. Composing these probabilistic mappings reveals a probability path that mimics the structure of a diffusion process, transporting data mass from the input distribution to the pre-trained feature distribution. This probability path can then be recompiled on a diffusion process with a unified transition model to enable principled propagation of representation uncertainty throughout the pre-trained model's architecture while maintaining its original predictive performance. Empirical results across a variety of vision and language benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves superior calibration and predictive accuracy compared to existing uncertainty-aware transformers.",

As the training scale increases, the network often becomes a bottleneck, motivating reducing the volume of transmitted data. Accordingly, recent systems demonstrated significant acceleration of the training process using gradient quantization. However, these systems are not optimized for multi-hop aggregation, where entries are partially summed multiple times along their aggregation topology. This paper presents DynamiQ, a quantization framework that bridges the gap between quantization best practices and multi-hop aggregation. DynamiQ introduces novel techniques to better represent partial sums, co-designed with a decompress-accumulate-recompress fused kernel to facilitate fast execution. We extended PyTorch DDP to support DynamiQ over NCCL P2P, and across different LLMs, tasks, and scales, we demonstrate consistent improvement of up to 34.2% over the best among state-of-the-art methods such as Omni-Reduce, THC, and emerging standards such as MXFP4, MXFP6, and MXFP8. Further, DynamiQ is the only evaluated method that consistently reaches near-baseline accuracy (e.g., 99.9% of the BF16 baseline) and does so while significantly accelerating the training.",

StealthRL trains a paraphrase policy against a multi-detector ensemble using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with LoRA adapters on Qwen3-4B, optimizing a composite reward that balances detector evasion with semantic preservation. We evaluate six attack settings (M0-M5) against three detector families (RoBERTa, FastDetectGPT, and Binoculars) at the security-relevant 1% false positive rate operating point. StealthRL achieves near-zero detection (0.001 mean TPR@1%FPR), reduces mean AUROC from 0.74 to 0.27, and attains a 99.9% attack success rate. Critically, attacks transfer to a held-out detector family not seen during training, revealing shared architectural vulnerabilities rather than detector-specific brittleness. We additionally conduct LLM-based quality evaluation via Likert scoring, analyze detector score distributions to explain why evasion succeeds, and provide per-detector AUROC with bootstrap confidence intervals.

We propose a framework for evaluating goal-directedness that integrates behavioural evaluation with interpretability-based analyses of models' internal representations. As a case study, we examine an LLM agent navigating a 2D grid world toward a goal state. Behaviourally, we evaluate the agent against an optimal policy across varying grid sizes, obstacle densities, and goal structures, finding that performance scales with task difficulty while remaining robust to difficulty-preserving transformations and complex goal structures. We then use probing methods to decode the agent's internal representations of the environment state and its multi-step action plans. We find that the LLM agent non-linearly encodes a coarse spatial map of the environment, preserving approximate task-relevant cues about its position and the goal location; that its actions are broadly consistent with these internal representations; and that reasoning reorganises them, shifting from broader environment structural cues toward information supporting immediate action selection. Our findings support the view that introspective examination is required beyond behavioural evaluations to characterise how agents represent and pursue their objectives.",

Moreover, it should lead to tractable DRO solutions. To this end, we propose generative model-based ambiguity sets that capture various adversarial distributions beyond the nominal support space while maintaining consistency with the nominal distribution. Building on this generative ambiguity modeling, we propose DRO with Generative Ambiguity Set (GAS-DRO), a tractable DRO algorithm that solves the inner maximization over the parameterized generative model space.

We implement GAS-DRO with a diffusion model and empirically demonstrate its superior Out-of-Distribution (OOD) generalization performance in ML tasks.",

However, real-world systems, from shifting financial cycles to elastic biological rhythms, frequently exhibit \"time-warped\" dynamics where the effective flow of time decouples from the sampling index. In this work, we first formalize this misalignment and prove that rotary position embedding (RoPE) is mathematically incapable of representing non-affine temporal warping. To address this, we propose Symplectic Positional Embeddings (SyPE), a learnable encoding framework derived from Hamiltonian mechanics. SyPE strictly generalizes RoPE by extending the rotation group $\\mathrm{SO}(2)$ to the symplectic group $\\mathrm{Sp}(2,\\mathbb{R})$, modulated by a novel input-dependent adaptive warp module. By allowing the attention mechanism to adaptively dilate or contract temporal coordinates end-to-end, our approach captures locally varying periodicities without requiring pre-defined warping functions. We implement this mechanism in StretchTime, a multivariate forecasting architecture that achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks, demonstrating superior robustness on datasets exhibiting non-stationary temporal dynamics.",

This difficulty partly arises from the natural rarity of certain classes (or hierarchical nodes) and the hierarchical constraint that ensures child nodes are almost always less frequent than their parents. To address this, we propose a weighted loss objective for neural networks that combines node-wise imbalance weighting with focal weighting components, the latter leveraging modern quantification of ensemble uncertainties. By emphasizing rare nodes rather than rare observations (data points), and focusing on uncertain nodes for each model output distribution during training, we observe improvements in recall by up to a factor of five on benchmark datasets, along with statistically significant gains in $F_{1}$ score. We also show our approach aids convolutional networks on challenging tasks, as in situations with suboptimal encoders or limited data.",

We introduce Dirichlet-Routed MoE (DirMoE), a novel end-to-end differentiable routing mechanism built on a Dirichlet variational autoencoder framework. This design fundamentally disentangles the core routing problems: expert selection, modeled by a Bernoulli component, and expert contribution among chosen experts, handled by a Dirichlet component. The entire forward pass remains fully differentiable through the use of Gumbel-Sigmoid relaxation for the expert selection and implicit reparameterization for the Dirichlet distribution. Our training objective, a variational ELBO, includes a direct sparsity penalty that precisely controls the number of active experts in expectation, alongside a schedule for key hyperparameters that guides the model from an exploratory to a definitive routing state.

We present \\textbf{Adaptively Rotated Optimization (ARO}, a new matrix optimization framework that treats gradient rotation as a first class design principle. ARO accelerates LLM training by performing normed steepest descent in a rotated coordinate system, where the rotation is determined by a novel norm-informed policy. This perspective yields update rules that go beyond existing orthogonalization and whitening optimizers, improving sample efficiency in practice. To make comparisons reliable, we propose a rigorously controlled benchmarking protocol that reduces confounding and bias. Under this protocol, ARO consistently outperforms AdamW (by 1.3 $\\sim$1.35$\\times$) and orthogonalization methods (by 1.1$\\sim$1.15$\\times$) in LLM pretraining at up to 8B activated parameters, and up to $8\\times$ overtrain budget, without evidence of diminishing returns.

ANCRe adaptively reassigns residual connections with negligible computational and memory overhead ($<1\\%$), while enabling more effective utilization of network depth.

        "abstract": "The rapid evolution of GUI-enabled agents has rendered traditional CAPTCHAs obsolete. While previous benchmarks like OpenCaptchaWorld established a baseline for evaluating multimodal agents, recent advancements in reasoning-heavy models, such as Gemini3-Pro-High and GPT-5.2-Xhigh have effectively collapsed this security barrier, achieving pass rates as high as 90% on complex logic puzzles like \"Bingo\". In response, we introduce Next-Gen CAPTCHAs, a scalable defense framework designed to secure the next-generation web against the advanced agents. Unlike static datasets, our benchmark is built upon a robust data generation pipeline, allowing for large-scale and easily scalable evaluations, notably, for backend-supported types, our system is capable of generating effectively unbounded CAPTCHA instances. We exploit the persistent human-agent \"Cognitive Gap\" in interactive perception, memory, decision-making, and action. By engineering dynamic tasks that require adaptive intuition rather than granular planning, we re-establish a robust distinction between biological users and artificial agents, offering a scalable and diverse defense mechanism for the agentic era.",

However, when a task is under-specified, agents might fail to learn useful policies. In this work, we explore the possibility of improving coarse-grained logical specifications via an exploration-guided strategy. We propose \\textsc{AutoSpec}, a framework that searches for a logical specification refinement whose satisfaction implies satisfaction of the original specification, but which provides additional guidance therefore making it easier for reinforcement learning algorithms to learn useful policies. \\textsc{AutoSpec} is applicable to reinforcement learning tasks specified via the SpectRL specification logic. We exploit the compositional nature of specifications written in SpectRL, and design four refinement procedures that modify the abstract graph of the specification by either refining its existing edge specifications or by introducing new edge specifications. We prove that all four procedures maintain specification soundness, i.e. any trajectory satisfying the refined specification also satisfies the original. We then show how \\textsc{AutoSpec} can be integrated with existing reinforcement learning algorithms for learning policies from logical specifications. Our experiments demonstrate that \\textsc{AutoSpec} yields promising improvements in terms of the complexity of control tasks that can be solved, when refined logical specifications produced by \\textsc{AutoSpec} are utilized.",

This work explores the capabilities of Whisper, a pre-trained ASR system, in speech emotion recognition by proposing two attention-based pooling methods, Multi-head Attentive Average Pooling and QKV Pooling, designed to efficiently reduce the dimensionality of Whisper representations while preserving emotional features. We experiment on English and Persian, using the IEMOCAP and ShEMO datasets respectively, with Whisper Tiny and Small. Our multi-head QKV architecture achieves state-of-the-art results on the ShEMO dataset, with a 2.47% improvement in unweighted accuracy. We further compare the performance of different Whisper encoder layers and find that intermediate layers often perform better for SER on the Persian dataset, providing a lightweight and efficient alternative to much larger models such as HuBERT X-Large. Our findings highlight the potential of Whisper as a representation extractor for SER and demonstrate the effectiveness of attention-based pooling for dimension reduction.",

Departing from data-intensive finetuning, we investigate the paradigm of Inference-time Language Acquisition (ILA), where an LLM masters an unfamiliar language through dynamic interaction with limited external resources. In this paper, we propose ILA-agent, a general ILA framework that equips LLMs with a set of behavioral primitives. By modeling essential human-like behaviors as a suite of tools, ILA-agent enables LLMs to incrementally explore, apply, and verify language knowledge through structured interactions with the official documentation and execution environment. To provide a rigorous evaluation in a low-resource setting, we construct Cangjie-bench, a multi-task benchmark based on the novel statically-typed language Cangjie. We instantiate ILA-agent for Cangjie and evaluate its performance across code generation, translation, and program repair tasks. Results using diverse LLMs demonstrate that ILA-agent significantly outperforms retrieval-augmented baselines. Further analysis of agent trajectories characterizes the emergent behavior patterns while highlighting persisting performance gaps.",

The core of our proposed methodology is a preliminary Doppler trace extraction stage, implemented to amplify salient motion-related signal features before classification. Subsequently, these enhanced inputs are processed by a hybrid neural architecture, which integrates Inception networks responsible for hierarchical spatial feature extraction and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks that capture temporal dependencies. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is then utilized as the final classification layer to optimize decision boundaries. The framework's efficacy was systematically validated using a public dataset across 20, 40, and 80 MHz bandwidth configurations. The model yielded accuracies of 89.27% (20 MHz), 94.13% (40 MHz), and 95.30% (80 MHz), respectively. These results confirm a marked superiority over standalone deep learning baselines, especially in the most constrained low-bandwidth scenarios. This study underscores the utility of combining Doppler-based feature engineering with a hybrid learning architecture for reliable HAR in bandwidth-limited wireless sensing applications.",

        "abstract": "Carbonate reservoirs offer significant capacity for subsurface carbon storage, oil production, and underground hydrogen storage. X-ray computed tomography (X-ray CT) coupled with numerical simulations is commonly used to investigate the multiphase flow behaviors in carbonate rocks. Carbonates exhibit pore size distribution across scales, hindering the comprehensive investigation with conventional X-ray CT images. Imaging samples at both macro and micro-scales (multi-scale imaging) proved to be a viable option in this context. However, multi-scale imaging faces two key limitations: the trade-off between field of view and voxel size necessitates resource-intensive imaging, while multi-scale multi-physics numerical simulations on resulting digital models incur prohibitive computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose a machine learning-enhanced data assimilation framework that leverages experimental drainage relative permeability measurements to achieve efficient characterization of micro-scale structures, delivering a data-driven solution toward a high-fidelity multiscale digital rock modeling. We train a dense neural network (DNN) as a proxy to a multi-scale pore network simulator and couple it with an ensemble smoother with multiple data assimilation (ESMDA) algorithm. DNN-ESMDA framework simultaneously infers the CO2-brine drainage relative permeability of microporosity phases with associated uncertainty estimation, revealing the relative importance of each rock phase and guiding future characterization. Our DNN-ESMDA framework achieves a computational speedup, reducing inference time from thousands of hours to seconds compared with the usage of conventional multiscale numerical simulation. Given this computational efficiency and applicability, the machine learning-enhanced ESMDA framework presents a generalizable approach for characterizing multiscale carbonate rocks.",

The recently proposed vanishing stacked residual PINN (VSR-PINN) embeds a vanishing-viscosity mechanism within stacked residual refinements to enable a smooth transition from the parabolic to hyperbolic regime. This paper integrates three curriculum-learning methods as primal-dual (PD) optimization, causality progression, and adaptive sampling into the VSR-PINN. The PD strategy balances physics and data losses, the causality scheme unlocks deeper stacks by respecting temporal and gradient evolution, and adaptive sampling targets high residuals. Numerical experiments on traffic reconstruction confirm that enforcing causality systematically reduces the median point-wise MSE and its variability across runs, yielding improvements of nearly one order of magnitude over non-causal training in both the baseline and PD variants.",

Dedicated subnetworks are used to process EEG features and auxiliary modalities, and a shared autoencoder-based fusion module is used to learn discriminative latent representations before classification. Subject-dependent experiments conducted on the PhyMER dataset across seven emotional classes achieve an accuracy of 95.45%, surpassing previously reported results. Furthermore, temporal attention analysis provides interpretable insights into emotion-specific temporal relevance, and t-SNE visualizations demonstrate enhanced class separability, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

        "abstract": "Reliable models should not only predict correctly, but also justify decisions with acceptable evidence. Yet conventional supervised learning typically provides only class-level labels, allowing models to achieve high accuracy through shortcut correlations rather than the intended evidence. Human priors can help constrain such behavior, but aligning models to these priors remains challenging because learned representations often diverge from human perception. To address this challenge, we propose an attribution-based human prior alignment method. We encode human priors as input regions that the model is expected to rely on (e.g., bounding boxes), and leverage a highly faithful subset-selection-based attribution approach to expose the model's decision evidence during training. When the attribution region deviates substantially from the prior regions, we penalize reliance on off-prior evidence, encouraging the model to shift its attribution toward the intended regions. This is achieved through a training objective that imposes attribution constraints induced by the human prior. We validate our method on both image classification and click decision tasks in MLLM-based GUI agent models. Across conventional classification and autoregressive generation settings, human prior alignment consistently improves task accuracy while also enhancing the model's decision reasonability.",

        "abstract": "Integration of AI into environmental regulation represents a significant advancement in data management. It offers promising results in both data protection plus algorithmic fairness. This research addresses the critical need for sustainable data protection in the era of ever evolving cyber threats. Traditional encryption methods face limitations in handling the dynamic nature of environmental data. This necessitates the exploration of advanced cryptographic techniques. The objective of this study is to evaluate how AI can enhance these techniques to ensure robust data protection while facilitating fair algorithmic management. The methodology involves a comprehensive review of current advancements in AI-enhanced homomorphic encryption (HE) and multi-party computation (MPC). It is coupled with an analysis of how these techniques can be applied to environmental data regulation. Key findings indicate that AI-driven dynamic key management, adaptive encryption schemes, and optimized computational efficiency in HE, alongside AI-enhanced protocol optimization and fault mitigation in MPC, significantly improve the security of environmental data processing. These findings highlight a crucial research gap in the intersection of AI, cyber laws, and environmental regulation, particularly in terms of addressing algorithmic bias, transparency, and accountability. The implications of this research underscore the need for stricter cyber laws. Also, the development of comprehensive regulations to safeguard sensitive environmental data. Future efforts should focus on refining AI systems to balance security with privacy and ensuring that regulatory frameworks can adapt to technological advancements. This study provides a foundation for future research aimed at achieving secure sustainable environmental data management through AI innovations.",

We propose Fair Context Learning (FCL), an episodic TTA framework that avoids entropy minimization by explicitly addressing shared-evidence bias. Motivated by our additive evidence decomposition assumption, FCL decouples adaptation into (i) augmentation-based exploration to identify plausible class candidates, and (ii) fairness-driven calibration that adapts text contexts to equalize sensitivity to common visual evidence. This fairness constraint mitigates partial feature obsession and enables effective calibration of text embeddings without relying on entropy reduction. Through extensive evaluation, we empirically validate our theoretical motivation and show that FCL achieves competitive adaptation performance relative to state-of-the-art TTA methods across diverse domain-shift and fine-grained benchmarks.",

To address these limitations, we present OMNI-Dent, a data-efficient and explainable diagnostic framework that incorporates clinical reasoning principles into a Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based pipeline. The framework operates on multi-view smartphone photographs,embeds diagnostic heuristics from dental experts, and guides a general-purpose VLM to perform tooth-level evaluation without dental-specific fine-tuning of the VLM. By utilizing the VLM's existing visual-linguistic capabilities, OMNI-Dent aims to support diagnostic assessment in settings where curated clinical imaging is unavailable.

This research presents Neural Sentinel, a novel unified approach that leverages Vision Language Models (VLMs) to perform license plate recognition, state classification, and vehicle attribute extraction through a single forward pass. Our primary contribution lies in demonstrating that a fine-tuned PaliGemma 3B model, adapted via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), can simultaneously answer multiple visual questions about vehicle images, achieving 92.3% plate recognition accuracy, which is a 14.1% improvement over EasyOCR and 9.9% improvement over PaddleOCR baselines. We introduce a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) continual learning framework that incorporates user corrections while preventing catastrophic forgetting through experience replay, maintaining a 70:30 ratio of original training data to correction samples. The system achieves a mean inference latency of 152ms with an Expected Calibration Error (ECE) of 0.048, indicating well calibrated confidence estimates. Additionally, the VLM first architecture enables zero-shot generalization to auxiliary tasks including vehicle color detection (89%), seatbelt detection (82%), and occupancy counting (78%) without task specific training. Through extensive experimentation on real world toll plaza imagery, we demonstrate that unified vision language approaches represent a paradigm shift in ALPR systems, offering superior accuracy, reduced architectural complexity, and emergent multi-task capabilities that traditional pipeline approaches cannot achieve.",

Despite recent progress, unlearning in text-to-image diffusion models remains challenging due to high computational costs and the difficulty of balancing effective forgetting with retention of unrelated concepts. We introduce FADE (Fast Adapter for Data Erasure), a two-stage unlearning method for image generation that combines parameter localization with self-distillation. FADE first identifies parameters most responsible for the forget set using gradient-based saliency and constrains updates through sparse LoRA adapters, ensuring lightweight, localized modifications. In a second stage, FADE applies a self-distillation objective that overwrites the forgotten concept with a user-defined surrogate while preserving behavior on retained data. The resulting adapters are memory-efficient, reversible, and can be merged or removed at runtime, enabling flexible deployment in production systems. We evaluated FADE on the UnlearnCanvas benchmark and conducted ablation studies on Imagenette, Labeled Faces in the Wild, AtharvaTaras Dog Breeds Dataset, and SUN Attributes datasets, demonstrating State-of-the-Art unlearning performance with fine-grained control over the forgetting-retention trade-off. Our results demonstrate that FADE achieves strong concept erasure and high retainability across various domains, making it a suitable solution for selective unlearning in diffusion-based image generation models.",

However, chemical reasoning is inherently continuous and structural, and forcing it into discrete linguistic tokens introduces a fundamental representation mismatch that constrains both efficiency and performance. We introduce LatentChem, a latent reasoning interface that decouples chemical computation from textual generation, enabling models to perform multi-step reasoning directly in continuous latent space while emitting language only for final outputs. Remarkably, we observe a consistent emergent behavior: when optimized solely for task success, models spontaneously internalize reasoning, progressively abandoning verbose textual derivations in favor of implicit latent computation. This shift is not merely stylistic but computationally advantageous. Across diverse chemical reasoning benchmarks, LatentChem achieves a 59.88\\% non-tie win rate over strong CoT-based baselines on ChemCoTBench, while delivering a 10.84$\\times$ average inference speedup. Our results provide empirical evidence that chemical reasoning is more naturally and effectively realized as continuous latent dynamics rather than discretized linguistic trajectories.",

We argue this brittleness is often data-induced: when images carry \"silent\" evidence and queries leave key semantics implicit, a single embedding pass must both reason and compress, encouraging spurious feature matching. We propose a data-centric framework that decouples these roles by externalizing reasoning before retrieval. Using a strong Vision--Language Model, we make implicit semantics explicit by densely captioning visual evidence in corpus entries, resolving ambiguous multimodal references in queries, and rewriting verbose instructions into concise retrieval constraints. Inference-time enhancement alone is insufficient; the retriever must be trained on these semantically dense representations to avoid distribution shift and fully exploit the added signal. Across M-BEIR, our reasoning-augmented training method yields consistent gains over strong baselines, with ablations showing that corpus enhancement chiefly benefits knowledge-intensive queries while query enhancement is critical for compositional modification requests.

Among those, Adjoint Matching (AM, Domingo-Enrich et al., 2025) has proven highly effective in continuous state spaces with differentiable rewards. Transferring these practical successes to discrete generative modeling, however, remains particularly challenging and largely unexplored, mainly due to the drastic shift in generative model classes to discrete state spaces, which are nowhere differentiable. In this work, we propose Discrete Adjoint Matching (DAM) -- a discrete variant of AM for fine-tuning discrete generative models characterized by Continuous-Time Markov Chains, such as diffusion-based large language models. The core of DAM is the introduction of discrete adjoint-an estimator of the optimal solution to the original problem but formulated on discrete domains-from which standard matching frameworks can be applied. This is derived via a purely statistical standpoint, in contrast to the control-theoretic viewpoint in AM, thereby opening up new algorithmic opportunities for general adjoint-based estimators. We showcase DAM's effectiveness on synthetic and mathematical reasoning tasks.",

        "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) multi-slab imaging is a promising approach for high-resolution in vivo diffusion MRI (dMRI) due to its compatibility with short TR (1-2 s), providing optimal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) efficiency. A major challenge, however, is slab boundary artifacts arising from non-ideal slab-selective RF excitation. Non-rectangular slab profiles reduce signal intensity at slab boundaries, while profile overlap across adjacent slabs introduces inter-slab crosstalk, where repeated excitation shortens the local TR and limits T1 recovery. To mitigate slab boundary artifacts without increasing scan time, we build on slab profile encoding and propose Slab-shifting for Harmonized 3D Acquisition and Reconstruction with Profile Encoding Networks (SHARPEN). For different diffusion directions, SHARPEN applies inter-volume field-of-view shifts along the slice direction to provide complementary slab profile encoding without prolonging acquisition. Slab profiles are estimated using a lightweight self-supervised neural network that exploits consistency across shifted acquisitions and known physical properties of slab profiles and diffusion images, and corrected images are reconstructed accordingly. SHARPEN was validated using simulated and prospectively acquired high-resolution in vivo data and demonstrates accurate slab profile estimation and robust boundary artifact correction, even in the presence of inter-volume motion. SHARPEN does not require high-quality reference training data and supports subject-specific training. Its efficient GPU-based implementation delivers faster and more accurate correction than NPEN, yielding slice-wise quantitative profiles that closely match those from reference 2D acquisitions. SHARPEN enables high-quality dMRI at 0.7 mm isotropic resolution on a 3T clinical scanner, highlighting its potential to advance submillimeter dMRI for neuroscience research.",

Existing methods lack principled mechanisms to detect or prevent such failures. To address this gap, we first propose a hierarchical metric that quantifies behavioral uncertainty at three levels: intra-agent (individual reasoning uncertainty), inter-agent (interactive uncertainty), and system-level (output uncertainty). Empirical analysis across several benchmarks reveals that our proposed uncertainty quantification reliably indicates system failures, which demonstrates the validity of using them as diagnostic metrics to indicate the system failure. Subsequently, we propose a mitigation strategy by formulating an uncertainty-driven policy optimization to penalize self-contradiction, peer conflict, and low-confidence outputs in a dynamic debating environment. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed uncertainty-driven mitigation reliably calibrates the multi-agent system by consistently improving decision accuracy while reducing system disagreement.",

However, environment erosion-the rapid evolution of hardware and software ecosystems for machine learning-has rendered many published MLE notebooks non-reproducible in contemporary environments, hindering code reuse and scientific progress. To quantify this gap, we study 12,720 notebooks mined from 79 popular Kaggle competitions: only 35.4% remain reproducible today. Crucially, we find that environment backporting, i.e., downgrading dependencies to match the submission time, does not improve reproducibility but rather introduces additional failure modes. To address environment erosion, we design and implement MLEModernizer, an LLM-driven agentic framework that treats the contemporary environment as a fixed constraint and modernizes notebook code to restore reproducibility. MLEModernizer iteratively executes notebooks, collects execution feedback, and applies targeted fixes in three types: error-repair, runtime-reduction, and score-calibration. Evaluated on 7,402 notebooks that are non-reproducible under the baseline environment, MLEModernizer makes 5,492 (74.2%) reproducible. MLEModernizer enables practitioners to validate, reuse, and maintain MLE artifacts as the hardware and software ecosystems continue to evolve.",

Using training and benchmark data for 809 models released between 2022 and 2025, we estimate scaling-law regressions with release-date and developer fixed effects. We find clear evidence of developer-specific efficiency advantages, but their importance depends on where models lie in the performance distribution. At the frontier, 80-90% of performance differences are explained by higher training compute, implying that scale--not proprietary technology--drives frontier advances. Away from the frontier, however, proprietary techniques and shared algorithmic progress substantially reduce the compute required to reach fixed capability thresholds. Some companies can systematically produce smaller models more efficiently. Strikingly, we also find substantial variation of model efficiency within companies; a firm can train two models with more than 40x compute efficiency difference. We also discuss the implications for AI leadership and capability diffusion.",

        "abstract": "Autonomous Vehicles (AVs), especially vision-based AVs, are rapidly being deployed without human operators. As AVs operate in safety-critical environments, understanding their robustness in an adversarial environment is an important research problem. Prior physical adversarial attacks on vision-based autonomous vehicles predominantly target immediate safety failures (e.g., a crash, a traffic-rule violation, or a transient lane departure) by inducing a short-lived perception or control error. This paper shows a qualitatively different risk: a long-horizon route integrity compromise, where an attacker gradually steers a victim AV away from its intended route and into an attacker-chosen destination while the victim continues to drive \"normally.\" This will not pose a danger to the victim vehicle itself, but also to potential passengers sitting inside the vehicle. In this paper, we design and implement the first adversarial framework, called JackZebra, that performs route-level hijacking of a vision-based end-to-end driving stack using a physically plausible attacker vehicle with a reconfigurable display mounted on the rear. The central challenge is temporal persistence: adversarial influence must remain effective in changing viewpoints, lighting, weather, traffic, and the victim's continual replanning -- without triggering conspicuous failures. Our key insight is to treat route hijacking as a closed-loop control problem and to convert adversarial patches into steering primitives that can be selected online via an interactive adjustment loop. Our adversarial patches are also carefully designed against worst-case background and sensor variations so that the adversarial impacts on the victim. Our evaluation shows that JackZebra can successfully hijack victim vehicles to deviate from original routes and stop at adversarial destinations with a high success rate.",

Using a two-parameter logistic Item Response Theory model, we jointly estimate latent task difficulty and model capability from model performance data across multiple benchmarks. We demonstrate that latent task difficulty varies linearly with the logarithm of human completion time, allowing human task completion time to be inferred for new benchmarks from model performance alone. Leveraging this alignment, we forecast frontier model capabilities in terms of human task length and independently reproduce METR's exponential scaling results, with the 50% solvable task horizon doubling approximately every 6 months.",

We introduce Cross-View World Models (XVWM), trained with a cross-view prediction objective: given a sequence of frames from one viewpoint, predict the future state from the same or a different viewpoint after an action is taken. Enforcing cross-view consistency acts as geometric regularization: because the input and output views may share little or no visual overlap, to predict across viewpoints, the model must learn view-invariant representations of the environment's 3D structure. We train on synchronized multi-view gameplay data from Aimlabs, an aim-training platform providing precisely aligned multi-camera recordings with high-frequency action labels. The resulting model gives agents parallel imagination streams across viewpoints, enabling planning in whichever frame of reference best suits the task while executing from the egocentric view. Our results show that multi-view consistency provides a strong learning signal for spatially grounded representations. Finally, predicting the consequences of one's actions from another viewpoint may offer a foundation for perspective-taking in multi-agent settings.",

We present a filtering and segmentation algorithm for detecting precipitates in FIB cross-section micrographs, optimized using linear genetic programming (LGP), which accounts for the various artifacts. To this end, the optimization environment uses a domain-specific language for image processing to iterate on solutions. Programs in this language are a list of image-filtering blocks with tunable parameters that sequentially process an input image, allowing for reliable generation and mutation by a genetic algorithm. Our environment produces optimized human-interpretable MATLAB code representing an image filtering pipeline. Under ideal conditions--a population size of 60 and a maximum program length of 5 blocks--our system was able to find a near-human accuracy solution with an average evaluation error of 1.8% when comparing segmentations pixel-by-pixel to a human baseline using an XOR error evaluation. Our automation work enabled faster iteration cycles and furthered exploration of the material composition and processing space: our optimized pipeline algorithm processes a 3.6 megapixel image in about 2 seconds on average.

In this work, we propose a unified optimization framework that reinterprets prior art as implicit strategies to avoid these corrupted regions. Based on this insight, we introduce Adaptive Matching Distillation (AMD), a self-correcting mechanism that utilizes reward proxies to explicitly detect and escape Forbidden Zones. AMD dynamically prioritizes corrective gradients via structural signal decomposition and introduces Repulsive Landscape Sharpening to enforce steep energy barriers against failure mode collapse. Extensive experiments across image and video generation tasks (e.g., SDXL, Wan2.1) and rigorous benchmarks (e.g., VBench, GenEval) demonstrate that AMD significantly enhances sample fidelity and training robustness. For instance, AMD improves the HPSv2 score on SDXL from 30.64 to 31.25, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. These findings validate that explicitly rectifying optimization trajectories within Forbidden Zones is essential for pushing the performance ceiling of few-step generative models.",

Heuristic pruning methods are efficient but sensitive to activation outliers, while reconstruction-based approaches improve fidelity at the cost of heavy computation. In this work, we propose a lightweight post-training pruning framework based on first-order statistical properties of model weights and activations. During pruning, channel-wise statistics are used to calibrate magnitude-based importance scores, reducing bias from activation-dominated channels. After pruning, we apply an analytic energy compensation to correct distributional distortions caused by weight removal. Both steps operate without retraining, gradients, or second-order information. Experiments across multiple LLM families, sparsity patterns, and evaluation tasks show that the proposed approach improves pruning performance while maintaining computational cost comparable to heuristic methods. The results suggest that simple statistical corrections can be effective for post-training pruning of LLMs.",

In right-censored survival settings, these issues may be further exacerbated by the additional uncertainty induced by censoring. We investigate several inference procedures applied after variable selection for the coefficients of the Lasso and its extension, the adaptive Lasso, in the context of the Cox model. The methods considered include sample splitting, exact post-selection inference, and the debiased Lasso. Their performance is examined in a neutral simulation study reflecting realistic covariate structures and censoring rates commonly encountered in biomedical applications.

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) promise to accelerate discovery by reasoning across the expanding scientific landscape. Yet, the challenge is no longer access to information but connecting it in meaningful, domain-spanning ways. In materials science, where innovation demands integrating concepts from molecular chemistry to mechanical performance, this is especially acute. Neither humans nor single-agent LLMs can fully contend with this torrent of information, with the latter often prone to hallucinations. To address this bottleneck, we introduce a multi-agent framework guided by large-scale knowledge graphs to find sustainable substitutes for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)-chemicals currently under intense regulatory scrutiny. Agents in the framework specialize in problem decomposition, evidence retrieval, design parameter extraction, and graph traversal, uncovering latent connections across distinct knowledge pockets to support hypothesis generation. Ablation studies show that the full multi-agent pipeline outperforms single-shot prompting, underscoring the value of distributed specialization and relational reasoning. We demonstrate that by tailoring graph traversal strategies, the system alternates between exploitative searches focusing on domain-critical outcomes and exploratory searches surfacing emergent cross-connections. Illustrated through the exemplar of biomedical tubing, the framework generates sustainable PFAS-free alternatives that balance tribological performance, thermal stability, chemical resistance, and biocompatibility. This work establishes a framework combining knowledge graphs with multi-agent reasoning to expand the materials design space, showcasing several initial design candidates to demonstrate the approach.",

By combining multiple RNPUs into an edge processor and assembling these blocks into a reconfigurable analog KAN (aKAN) architecture with integrated mixed-signal interfacing, we establish a realistic system-level hardware implementation that enables compact KAN-style regression and classification with programmable nonlinear transformations. Using experimentally calibrated RNPU models and hardware measurements, we demonstrate accurate function approximation across increasing task complexity while requiring fewer or comparable trainable parameters than multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). System-level estimates indicate an energy per inference of $\\sim$250 pJ and an end-to-end inference latency of $\\sim$600 ns for a representative workload, corresponding to a $\\sim$10$^{2}$-10$^{3}\\times$ reduction in energy accompanied by a $\\sim$10$\\times$ reduction in area compared to a digital fixed-point MLP at similar approximation error.

To address these challenges, we propose a unified \\textbf{M}ulti-\\textbf{D}istribution \\textbf{L}earning (MDL) framework, inspired by the \"prompting\" paradigm in large language models (LLMs). MDL treats scenario and task information as specialized tokens rather than auxiliary inputs or gating signals. Specifically, we introduce a unified information tokenization module that transforms features, scenarios, and tasks into a unified tokenized format. To facilitate deep interaction, we design three synergistic mechanisms: (1) feature token self-attention for rich feature interactions, (2) domain-feature attention for scenario/task-adaptive feature activation, and (3) domain-fused aggregation for joint distribution prediction. By stacking these interactions, MDL enables scenario and task information to \"prompt\" and activate the model's vast parameter space in a bottom-up, layer-wise manner. Extensive experiments on real-world industrial datasets demonstrate that MDL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art MSL and MTL baselines. Online A/B testing on Douyin Search platform over one month yields +0.0626\\% improvement in LT30 and -0.3267\\% reduction in change query rate.

To address this issue, we propose an LLM-Guided Diagnostic Evidence Alignment method (LGDEA), which shifts the pretraining objective toward evidence-level alignment that is more consistent with the medical diagnostic process. Specifically, we leverage LLMs to extract key diagnostic evidence from radiology reports and construct a shared diagnostic evidence space, enabling evidence-aware cross-modal alignment and allowing LGDEA to effectively exploit abundant unpaired medical images and reports, thereby substantially alleviating the reliance on paired data. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves consistent and significant improvements on phrase grounding, image--text retrieval, and zero-shot classification, and even rivals pretraining methods that rely on substantial paired data.",

When the length is unknown, as in realistic completion and infilling, naively comparing confidence across mask lengths becomes systematically biased, leading to under-generation or redundant continuations. In this paper, we show that this failure arises from an intrinsic lengthinduced bias in generation confidence estimates, leaving existing DLLMs without a robust way to determine generation length and making variablelength inference unreliable. To address this issue, we propose LR-DLLM, a length-regularized inference framework for DLLMs that treats generation length as an explicit variable and achieves reliable length determination at inference time. It decouples semantic compatibility from lengthinduced uncertainty through an explicit length regularization that corrects biased confidence estimates. Based on this, LR-DLLM enables dynamic expansion or contraction of the generation span without modifying the underlying DLLM or its training procedure. Experiments show that LRDLLM achieves 51.3% Pass@1 on HumanEvalInfilling under fully unknown lengths (+13.4% vs. DreamOn) and 51.5% average Pass@1 on four-language McEval (+14.3% vs. DreamOn).",

Although larger models often yield better task performance and brain alignment, they are increasingly difficult to analyze mechanistically. This raises a fundamental question: what is the minimal model capacity required to capture brain-relevant representations? To address this question, we systematically investigate how constraining model scale and numerical precision affects brain alignment. We compare full-precision LLMs, small language models (SLMs), and compressed variants (quantized and pruned) by predicting fMRI responses during naturalistic language comprehension. Across model families up to 14B parameters, we find that 3B SLMs achieve brain predictivity indistinguishable from larger LLMs, whereas 1B models degrade substantially, particularly in semantic language regions. Brain alignment is remarkably robust to compression: most quantization and pruning methods preserve neural predictivity, with GPTQ as a consistent exception. Linguistic probing reveals a dissociation between task performance and brain predictivity: compression degrades discourse, syntax, and morphology, yet brain predictivity remains largely unchanged. Overall, brain alignment saturates at modest model scales and is resilient to compression, challenging common assumptions about neural scaling and motivating compact models for brain-aligned language modeling.",

However, unlike computer vision tasks where visual fidelity suffices, physical systems require the rigorous reproduction of higher-order statistical moments and thermodynamic quantities. While Score-Based Generative Models (SGMs) have emerged as a powerful tool, their standard formulation on Euclidean embedding space is ill-suited for continuous spin systems, where variables inherently reside on a manifold. In this work, we demonstrate that training on the Euclidean space compromises the model's ability to learn the target distribution as it prioritizes to learn the manifold constraints. We address this limitation by proposing the use of Manifold-Aware Score-Based Generative Modeling framework applied to the 64x64 2D XY model (a 4096-dimensional torus). We show that our method estimates the theoretical Boltzmann score with superior precision compared to standard diffusion models. Consequently, we successfully capture the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz Thouless (BKT) phase transition and accurately reproduce second-moment quantities, such as heat capacity without explicit feature engineering. Furthermore, we demonstrate zero-shot generalization to unseen lattice sizes, accurately recovering the physics of variable system scales without retraining.

        "abstract": "While the shift toward unified foundation models has revolutionized many deep learning domains, sleep medicine remains largely restricted to task-specific models that focus on localized micro-structure features. These approaches often neglect the rich, multi-modal context of Polysomnography (PSG) and fail to capture the global macro-structure of a full night's sleep. To address this, we introduce SleepMaMi , a Sleep Foundation Model engineered to master both hour-long sleep architectures and fine-grained signal morphologies. Our framework utilizes a hierarchical dual-encoder design: a Macro-Encoder to model full-night temporal dependencies and a Micro-Encoder to capture short-term characteristics from biosignals. Macro-Encoder is trained via Demographic-Guided Contrastive Learning, which aligns overnight sleep patterns with objective subject metadata, such as age, sex and BMI to refine global representations. Micro-Encoder is optimized via a hybrid Masked Autoencoder (MAE) and multi-modal contrastive objective. Pre-trained on a massive corpus of $>$20,000 PSG recordings (158K hours),SleepMaMi outperforms existing foundation models across a diverse suite of downstream tasks, demonstrating superior generalizability and label-efficient adaptation for clinical sleep analysis.",

By reformulating MFVI as a constrained finite-sum problem, we develop a novel primal-dual algorithm based on an augmented Lagrangian formulation, termed primal-dual variational inference (PD-VI). PD-VI jointly updates global and local variational parameters in the evidence lower bound in a scalable manner. To further account for heterogeneous loss geometry across different variational parameter blocks, we introduce a block-preconditioned extension, P$^2$D-VI, which adapts the primal-dual updates to the geometry of each parameter block and improves both numerical robustness and practical efficiency. We establish convergence guarantees for both PD-VI and P$^2$D-VI under properly chosen constant step size, without relying on conjugacy assumptions or explicit bounded-variance conditions. In particular, we prove $O(1/T)$ convergence to a stationary point in general settings and linear convergence under strong convexity. Numerical experiments on synthetic data and a real large-scale spatial transcriptomics dataset demonstrate that our methods consistently outperform existing stochastic variational inference approaches in terms of convergence speed and solution quality.",

In low dimensions these sets are easy to interpret, but in high-dimensional or structured output spaces they are difficult to represent and use, which can limit their ability to integrate with downstream tasks such as sampling and probabilistic forecasting. We show that any differentiable nonconformity score induces a deterministic flow on the output space whose trajectories converge to the boundary of the corresponding conformal prediction set. This leads to a computationally efficient, training-free method for sampling conformal boundaries in arbitrary dimensions. Boundary samples can be reconformalized to form pointwise prediction sets with controlled risk, and mixing across confidence levels yields conformal predictive distributions whose quantile regions coincide exactly with conformal prediction sets. We evaluate the approach on PDE inverse problems, precipitation downscaling, climate model debiasing, and hurricane trajectory forecasting.",

These visual representations pose unique challenges for machine understanding, as they combine both structural and visual complexities. While recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show promising results in table understanding, they typically assume the relevant table is readily available. However, a more practical scenario involves identifying and reasoning over relevant tables from large-scale collections to answer user queries. To address this gap, we propose TabRAG, a framework that enables MLLMs to answer queries over large collections of table images. Our approach first retrieves candidate tables using jointly trained visual-text foundation models, then leverages MLLMs to perform fine-grained reranking of these candidates, and finally employs MLLMs to reason over the selected tables for answer generation. Through extensive experiments on a newly constructed dataset comprising 88,161 training and 9,819 testing samples across 8 benchmarks with 48,504 unique tables, we demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing methods by 7.0% in retrieval recall and 6.1% in answer accuracy, offering a practical solution for real-world table understanding tasks.",

This execution-based world modeling enables internal verification within the model, offering an alternative to natural language chain-of-thought reasoning. However, the sources of errors and the nature of CWMs' limitations remain poorly understood. We study CWMs from two complementary perspectives: local semantic execution and long-horizon state tracking. On real-code benchmarks, we identify two dominant failure regimes. First, dense runtime state reveals produce token-intensive execution traces, leading to token-budget exhaustion on programs with long execution histories. Second, failures disproportionately concentrate in string-valued state, which we attribute to limitations of subword tokenization rather than program structure. To study long-horizon behavior, we use a controlled permutation-tracking benchmark that isolates state propagation under action execution. We show that long-horizon degradation is driven primarily by incorrect action generation: when actions are replaced with ground-truth commands, a Transformer-based CWM propagates state accurately over long horizons, despite known limitations of Transformers in long-horizon state tracking. These findings suggest directions for more efficient supervision and state representations in CWMs that are better aligned with program execution and data types.",

We introduce the $(\\varepsilon,\\varepsilon')$-closure dimension, a scale-sensitive analogue of closure dimension, which yields characterizations of uniform and non-uniform generatability and a sufficient condition for generation in the limit. Along the way, we identify a sharp geometric contrast. Namely, in doubling spaces, including all finite-dimensional normed spaces, generatability is stable across novelty scales and invariant under equivalent metrics. In general metric spaces, however, generatability can be highly scale-sensitive and metric-dependent; even in the natural infinite-dimensional Hilbert space $\\ell^2$, all notions of generation may fail abruptly as the novelty parameters vary.",

        "abstract": "Contextual bandits are a core technology for personalized mobile health interventions, where decision-making requires adapting to complex, non-linear user behaviors. While Thompson Sampling (TS) is a preferred strategy for these problems, its performance hinges on the quality of the underlying reward model. Standard linear models suffer from high bias, while neural network approaches are often brittle and difficult to tune in online settings. Conversely, tree ensembles dominate tabular data prediction but typically rely on heuristic uncertainty quantification, lacking a principled probabilistic basis for TS. We propose Bayesian Forest Thompson Sampling (BFTS), the first contextual bandit algorithm to integrate Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART), a fully probabilistic sum-of-trees model, directly into the exploration loop. We prove that BFTS is theoretically sound, deriving an information-theoretic Bayesian regret bound of $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{T})$. As a complementary result, we establish frequentist minimax optimality for a \"feel-good\" variant, confirming the structural suitability of BART priors for non-parametric bandits. Empirically, BFTS achieves state-of-the-art regret on tabular benchmarks with near-nominal uncertainty calibration. Furthermore, in an offline policy evaluation on the Drink Less micro-randomized trial, BFTS improves engagement rates by over 30% compared to the deployed policy, demonstrating its practical effectiveness for behavioral interventions.",

Specifically, we first construct PlanFactory, a modular design space that standardizes diverse planning paradigms within a unified codebase encompassing topology, initialization, adaptation, and navigation, thereby providing a common interface for heterogeneous planning patterns. Leveraging PlanFactory, we collect high-quality planning trajectories and train Todo-14B via \\textit{Impedance-Guided Preference Optimization} (IGPO), a multi-objective reinforcement learning objective that encourages the generation of planning systems that are performant, stable, and token-efficient across arbitrary tasks and agent backbones.

In this attack scenario, malicious commands hidden within untrusted content trick the agent into performing unauthorized actions. Existing defenses can reduce attack success but often suffer from the over-defense dilemma: they deploy expensive, always-on sanitization regardless of actual threat, thereby degrading utility and latency even in benign scenarios. We revisit IPI through a causal ablation perspective: a successful injection manifests as a dominance shift where the user request no longer provides decisive support for the agent's privileged action, while a particular untrusted segment, such as a retrieved document or tool output, provides disproportionate attributable influence. Based on this signature, we propose CausalArmor, a selective defense framework that (i) computes lightweight, leave-one-out ablation-based attributions at privileged decision points, and (ii) triggers targeted sanitization only when an untrusted segment dominates the user intent. Additionally, CausalArmor employs retroactive Chain-of-Thought masking to prevent the agent from acting on ``poisoned'' reasoning traces. We present a theoretical analysis showing that sanitization based on attribution margins conditionally yields an exponentially small upper bound on the probability of selecting malicious actions. Experiments on AgentDojo and DoomArena demonstrate that CausalArmor matches the security of aggressive defenses while improving explainability and preserving utility and latency of AI agents.",

We conduct large-scale offline evaluations and online A/B testing in a real-world recommendation system, under a unified serving stack that also compares LAFB with deployable popularity-oriented remedies. Results show that LAFB increases novel watch-time share and improves exposure for emerging creators and overall content diversity, while maintaining stable overall watch time and short-term satisfaction. LAFB has already been launched in the post-ranking stage of YouTube's recommendation system, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world applications.",

We address both issues in the full-data (batch) regime. First, we derive a batch minorization-maximization (MM) algorithm for softmax-gated multinomial-logistic MoE using an explicit quadratic minorizer, yielding coordinate-wise closed-form updates that guarantee monotone ascent of the objective and global convergence to a stationary point (in the standard MM sense), avoiding approximate M-steps common in EM-type implementations. Second, we prove finite-sample rates for conditional density estimation and parameter recovery, and we adapt dendrograms of mixing measures to the classification setting to obtain a sweep-free selector of the number of experts that achieves near-parametric optimal rates after merging redundant fitted atoms. Experiments on biological protein--protein interaction prediction validate the full pipeline, delivering improved accuracy and better-calibrated probabilities than strong statistical and machine-learning baselines.",

We then embed these inequalities into the analysis of generalization error for stochastic learning algorithms, yielding novel and tighter high-probability information-theoretic generalization bounds, while also recovering several best-known results via simplified analyses. A key advantage of our framework is its flexibility: it readily adapts to a range of settings, including the conditional mutual information framework, PAC-Bayesian theory, and differential privacy mechanisms, for which we derive new generalization bounds.",

        "abstract": "Although Video Large Language Models (VLLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in video understanding, they are required to process high volumes of visual tokens, causing significant computational inefficiency. Existing VLLMs acceleration frameworks usually compress spatial and temporal redundancy independently, which overlooks the spatiotemporal relationships, thereby leading to suboptimal spatiotemporal compression. The highly correlated visual features are likely to change in spatial position, scale, orientation, and other attributes over time due to the dynamic nature of video. Building on this insight, we introduce FlashVID, a training-free inference acceleration framework for VLLMs. Specifically, FlashVID utilizes Attention and Diversity-based Token Selection (ADTS) to select the most representative tokens for basic video representation, then applies Tree-based Spatiotemporal Token Merging (TSTM) for fine-grained spatiotemporal redundancy elimination. Extensive experiments conducted on three representative VLLMs across five video understanding benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our method. Notably, by retaining only 10% of visual tokens, FlashVID preserves 99.1% of the performance of LLaVA-OneVision. Consequently, FlashVID can serve as a training-free and plug-and-play module for extending long video frames, which enables a 10x increase in video frame input to Qwen2.5-VL, resulting in a relative improvement of 8.6% within the same computational budget.

Graph-based SSL (GSSL) has emerged as a popular framework that captures data structure through graph representations. Classic graph SSL methods, such as Label Propagation and Label Spreading, aim to compute low-dimensional representations where points with the same labels are close in representation space. Although often effective, these methods can be suboptimal on data with complex label distributions. In our work, we develop AUC-spec, a graph approach that computes a low-dimensional representation that maximizes class separation. We compute this representation by optimizing the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) as estimated via the labeled points. We provide a detailed analysis of our approach under a product-of-manifold model, and show that the required number of labeled points for AUC-spec is polynomial in the model parameters. Empirically, we show that AUC-spec balances class separation with graph smoothness. It demonstrates competitive results on synthetic and real-world datasets while maintaining computational efficiency comparable to the field's classic and state-of-the-art methods.",

We introduce a two-stage gradient-based framework that provides interpretable diagnostics for three critical failure analysis tasks: (1) detecting the true initial failure source (Patient-0); (2) validating why non-attacked agents may be flagged first due to domino effects; and (3) tracing how failures propagate through learned coordination pathways. Stage 1 performs interpretable per-agent failure detection via Taylor-remainder analysis of policy-gradient costs, declaring an initial Patient-0 candidate at the first threshold crossing. Stage 2 provides validation through geometric analysis of critic derivatives-first-order sensitivity and directional second-order curvature aggregated over causal windows to construct interpretable contagion graphs. This approach explains \"downstream-first\" detection anomalies by revealing pathways that amplify upstream deviations. Evaluated across 500 episodes in Simple Spread (3 and 5 agents) and 100 episodes in StarCraft II using MADDPG and HATRPO, our method achieves 88.2-99.4% Patient-0 detection accuracy while providing interpretable geometric evidence for detection decisions. By moving beyond black-box detection to interpretable gradient-level forensics, this framework offers practical tools for diagnosing cascading failures in safety-critical MARL systems.",

Our results extend the work of \\cite{MN23} to the constant-degree regime with noisy measurements, and also resolve a conjecture in \\cite{YLS24+} when the number of networks is a constant. Our information-theoretic lower bound is obtained via a novel comparison inequality between Bernoulli and Gaussian moments, as well as a statistical variant of the ``recovery to chi-square divergence reduction'' argument inspired by \\cite{DHSS25}.

Starting from a log-linear edge-weight model, we derive closed-form expressions for the hitting-time probability mass function, its full moment hierarchy, and the observed Fisher information. The Fisher matrix of each seed node turns out to be rank-one, taking the quotient by its null space yields a low-dimensional, globally flat manifold that captures all identifiable directions of the model. Leveraging the geometry, we introduce a sensitivity score for unlabeled nodes that bounds, and in one-dimensional cases attains, the maximal first-order change in DRW betweenness under unit Fisher perturbations.

        "abstract": "The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) demands increasingly reliable evaluation, yet current centralized evaluation suffers from opacity, overfitting, and hardware-induced variance. Our empirical analysis reveals an alarming inconsistency in existing evaluations: the standard deviation across ten repeated runs of a single model on HumanEval (1.67) actually exceeds the performance gap among the top-10 models on the official leaderboard (0.91), rendering current rankings statistically precarious. To mitigate these instabilities, we propose a decentralized evaluation framework that enables hardware and parameter diversity through large-scale benchmarking across heterogeneous compute nodes. By leveraging the blockchain-based protocol, the framework incentivizes global contributors to act as independent validators, using a robust reward system to ensure evaluation integrity and discourage dishonest participation. This collective verification transforms evaluation from a \"centralized black box\" into a \"decentralized endorsement\" where multi-party consensus and diverse inference environments yield a more stable, representative metric. Experimental results demonstrate that the decentralized evaluation framework reduces the standard deviation across ten runs on the same model to 0.28. This significant improvement over conventional frameworks ensures higher statistical confidence in model rankings. We have completely implemented this platform and will soon release it to the community.",

The best-known adaptive regret bounds are achieved by Shampoo-like methods, but they require solving a costly quadratic projection subproblem. To address this, we extend the gradient-based prediction scheme to adaptive matrix online learning and cast algorithm design as constructing a family of smoothed potentials for the nuclear norm. We define a notion of admissibility for such smoothings and prove any admissible smoothing yields a regret bound matching the best-known guarantees of one-sided Shampoo. We instantiate this framework with two efficient methods that avoid quadratic projections. The first is an adaptive Follow-the-Perturbed-Leader (FTPL) method using Gaussian stochastic smoothing. The second is Follow-the-Augmented-Matrix-Leader (FAML), which uses a deterministic hyperbolic smoothing in an augmented matrix space. By analyzing the admissibility of these smoothings, we show both methods admit closed-form updates and match one-sided Shampoo's regret up to a constant factor, while significantly reducing computational cost. Lastly, using the online-to-nonconvex conversion, we derive two matrix-based optimizers, Pion (from FTPL) and Leon (from FAML). We prove convergence guarantees for these methods in nonsmooth nonconvex settings, a guarantee that the popular Muon optimizer lacks.",

Debiased Direct Preference Optimization (DDPO) augments standard DPO with a residual-based correction and density-ratio reweighting to mitigate systematic bias, while retaining DPO's computational efficiency. Debiased Identity Preference Optimization (DIPO) directly estimates human preference probabilities without imposing a parametric reward model. We provide theoretical guarantees for both methods: DDPO offers a practical and computationally efficient solution for large-scale alignment, whereas DIPO serves as a robust, statistically optimal alternative that attains the semiparametric efficiency bound. Empirical studies on sentiment generation, summarization, and single-turn dialogue demonstrate that the proposed methods substantially improve alignment efficiency and recover performance close to that of an oracle trained on fully human-labeled data.",

We study this question by deriving the velocity field targeted by the empirical FM objective on sequential data, in the limit of perfect function approximation. For the Gaussian conditional paths commonly used in practice, we show that the implied sampler is an ODE whose dynamics constitutes a nonparametric, memory-augmented continuous-time dynamical system. The optimal field admits a closed-form expression as a similarity-weighted mixture of instantaneous velocities induced by past transitions, making the dataset dependence explicit and interpretable. This perspective positions neural FM models trained by stochastic optimization as parametric surrogates of an ideal nonparametric solution. Using the structure of the optimal field, we study sampling and approximation schemes that improve the efficiency and numerical robustness of ODE-based generation. On nonlinear dynamical system benchmarks, the resulting closed-form sampler yields strong probabilistic forecasts directly from historical transitions, without training.",

A central bottleneck is representation: hand-crafted flow statistics are efficient but often too lossy, raw-bit encodings can be accurate but are costly, and recent pre-trained embeddings provide transfer but frequently flatten the protocol stack and entangle signals across layers. We observe that real traffic contains substantial redundancy both across network layers and within each layer; existing paradigms do not explicitly identify and remove this redundancy, leading to wasted capacity, shortcut learning, and degraded generalization. To address this, we propose PACC, a redundancy-aware, layer-aware representation framework. PACC treats the protocol stack as multi-view inputs and learns compact layer-wise projections that remain faithful to each layer while explicitly factorizing representations into shared (cross-layer) and private (layer-specific) components. We operationalize these goals with a joint objective that preserves layer-specific information via reconstruction, captures shared structure via contrastive mutual-information learning, and maximizes task-relevant information via supervised losses, yielding compact latents suitable for efficient inference. Across datasets covering encrypted application classification, IoT device identification, and intrusion detection, PACC consistently outperforms feature-engineered and raw-bit baselines. On encrypted subsets, it achieves up to a 12.9% accuracy improvement over nPrint. PACC matches or surpasses strong foundation-model baselines. At the same time, it improves end-to-end efficiency by up to 3.16x.",

Existing agent memory systems are typically designed within isolated paradigms (e.g., explicit, parametric, or latent memory) with tightly coupled retrieval methods that hinder cross-paradigm generalization and fusion. In this work, we take a first step toward unifying heterogeneous memory paradigms within a single memory system. We propose MemAdapter, a memory retrieval framework that enables fast alignment across agent memory paradigms. MemAdapter adopts a two-stage training strategy: (1) training a generative subgraph retriever from the unified memory space, and (2) adapting the retriever to unseen memory paradigms by training a lightweight alignment module through contrastive learning. This design improves the flexibility for memory retrieval and substantially reduces alignment cost across paradigms. Comprehensive experiments on three public evaluation benchmarks demonstrate that the generative subgraph retriever consistently outperforms five strong agent memory systems across three memory paradigms and agent model scales. Notably, MemAdapter completes cross-paradigm alignment within 13 minutes on a single GPU, achieving superior performance over original memory retrievers with less than 5% of training compute. Furthermore, MemAdapter enables effective zero-shot fusion across memory paradigms, highlighting its potential as a plug-and-play solution for agent memory systems.",

To address this, we propose Imitation-to-Interaction, a progressive reinforcement learning framework designed to evolve a robot from a \"mimic\" to a capable \"striker.\" Our approach establishes a robust motor prior from human data, distills it into a compact, model-based state representation, and stabilizes dynamics via adversarial priors. Crucially, to overcome the sparsity of expert demonstrations, we introduce a manifold expansion strategy that generalizes discrete strike points into a dense interaction volume. We validate our framework through the mastery of diverse skills, including lifts and drop shots, in simulation.

Our core contribution is a tutor-apprentice dialogue where a deterministic Logic Tutor, grounded in a formal safety ontology, provides causal and pedagogical feedback to an LLM planner. This enables intelligent plan repairs rather than mere avoidance. We also introduce a scalable knowledge acquisition pipeline that synthesizes safety knowledge bases from real-world documents, correcting blind spots in existing benchmarks. In challenging home safety tasks, VIRF achieves a perfect 0 percent Hazardous Action Rate (HAR) and a 77.3 percent Goal-Condition Rate (GCR), which is the highest among all baselines. It is highly efficient, requiring only 1.1 correction iterations on average. VIRF demonstrates a principled pathway toward building fundamentally trustworthy and verifiably safe embodied agents.",

However, individuals are inclined to defect in order to benefit from the group's cooperation without contributing the associated costs, thus leading to unfair situations. In game theory, social dilemmas entail this dichotomy between individual interest and collective outcome. The most dominant approach to multi-agent cooperation is the utilitarian welfare which can produce efficient highly inequitable outcomes. This paper proposes a novel framework to foster fairer cooperation by replacing the standard utilitarian objective with Proportional Fairness. We introduce a fair altruistic utility for each agent, defined on the individual log-payoff space and derive the analytical conditions required to ensure cooperation in classic social dilemmas. We then extend this framework to sequential settings by defining a Fair Markov Game and deriving novel fair Actor-Critic algorithms to learn fair policies. Finally, we evaluate our method in various social dilemma environments.",

        "abstract": "Safety evaluation for advanced AI systems implicitly assumes that behavior observed under evaluation is predictive of behavior in deployment. This assumption becomes fragile for agents with situational awareness, which may exploitregime leakage-informational cues distinguishing evaluation from deployment-to implement conditional policies such as sycophancy and sleeper agents, which preserve compliance under oversight while defecting in deployment-like regimes. We reframe alignment evaluation as a problem of information flow under partial observability. Within this framework, we show that divergence between evaluation-time and deployment-time behavior is bounded by the mutual information between internal representations and the regime variable. Motivated by this result, we study regime-blind mechanisms: training-time interventions that reduce the extractability of regime information at decision-relevant internal representations via adversarial invariance. We evaluate this approach on a base, open-weight language model across two fully characterized failure modes -scientific sycophancy and temporal sleeper agents. Regime-blind training suppresses regime-conditioned behavior in both evaluated cases without measurable loss of task utility, but with qualitatively different dynamics: sycophancy exhibits a sharp representational and behavioral transition at low intervention strength, whereas sleeper-agent behavior requires substantially stronger pressure and does not exhibit a clean collapse of regime decodability. These results demonstrate that representational invariance is a meaningful but fundamentally limited control lever, whose effectiveness depends on how regime information is embedded in the policy. We argue that behavioral evaluation should be complemented with white-box diagnostics of regime awareness and information flow.",

In the context of supervised learning, most of the works that tackle classification problems with parameterized quantum circuits constrain their scope to the setting of binary classification or perform multiclass classification via ensembles of binary classifiers (strategies such as one versus rest). Those few works that propose native multiclass models, however, do not justify the choice of observables that perform the classification. This work studies two main classification criteria in multiclass quantum machine learning: maximizing the expected value of an observable representing a class or maximizing the fidelity of the encoded quantum state with a reference state representing a class. To compare both approaches, sets of Pauli strings and sets of projectors into the computational basis are chosen as observables in the quantum machine learning models. Observing the empirical behavior of each model type, the effect of different observable set choices on the performance of quantum machine learning models is analyzed in the context of Barren Plateaus and Neural Collapse. The results provide insights that may guide the design of future multiclass quantum machine learning models.",

To address this challenge, we propose correction-specific rollouts (Octopus), an RL rollout augmentation framework that synthesizes dense self-correction examples by recombining existing rollouts. This augmentation simultaneously improves sample efficiency due to rollout reuse and stabilizes RL optimization through balanced supervision. Furthermore, we introduce a response-masking strategy that decouples self-correction from direct reasoning, avoiding signal conflicts and enabling both behaviors to be learned effectively. Building on this, we introduce Octopus-8B, a reasoning VLM with controllable self-correction capability. Across 7 benchmarks, it achieves SoTA performance among open-source VLMs, outperforming the best RLVR baseline by 1.0 score while requiring only $0.72\\times$ training time per step.",

The proposed approach is tested on several benchmark problems, including the Burgers, Schrödinger, Allen-Cahn, and three-dimensional Bratu equations. Numerical results demonstrate that LM significantly outperforms BFGS in terms of convergence speed, accuracy, and final loss values, even when using shallow network architectures with only two hidden layers.

This regime can systematically under-estimate a fixed model's true capability: many errors arise not from missing knowledge, but from premature commitment under internal ambiguity. We introduce \\emph{Reinforcement Inference}, an entropy-aware inference-time control strategy that uses the model's own uncertainty to selectively invoke a second, more deliberate reasoning attempt, enabling stronger performance \\emph{without any retraining}. On 12,032 MMLU-Pro questions across 14 subjects, using DeepSeek-v3.2 with deterministic decoding in a zero-shot setting, Reinforcement Inference improves accuracy from 60.72\\% to 84.03\\%, while only incurring 61.06\\% additional inference calls. A 100\\% re-asking ablation reaches 84.35\\%, indicating that uncertainty-aware selection captures most of the attainable improvement with substantially less compute. Moreover, a \\emph{prompt-only} ablation underperforms the baseline, suggesting that the gains are not explained by generic `` your output had high entropy, think step-by-step'' prompting alone. Beyond providing a practical inference-time upgrade, our results suggest a broader \\emph{entropy-aware} paradigm for measuring and expanding model capability: because modern decoder-based models generate outputs autoregressively, entropy and related confidence measures arise naturally as first-class control signals during generation. The resulting gap between one-pass greedy inference and uncertainty-conditioned deliberation offers a diagnostic lens on an LLM's latent reasoning horizon and motivates future training objectives that explicitly constrain correctness--confidence alignment.",

One option is to directly optimize the initial latent code (noise), such that the flow output solves the inverse problem. However, this requires backpropagating through the entire generative trajectory, incurring high memory costs and numerical instability. We propose MS-Flow, which represents the trajectory as a sequence of intermediate latent states rather than a single initial code. By enforcing the flow dynamics locally and coupling segments through trajectory-matching penalties, MS-Flow alternates between updating intermediate latent states and enforcing consistency with observed data. This reduces memory consumption while improving reconstruction quality. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MS-Flow over existing methods on image recovery and inverse problems, including inpainting, super-resolution, and computed tomography.",

In the dynamic setting, the graph is subject to adversarial edge updates, and the goal is to maintain explicitly an exact $(k, z)$-clustering solution in the induced shortest-path metric. While efficient dynamic $k$-center approximation algorithms on graphs exist [Cruciani et al. SODA 2024], to the best of our knowledge, no prior work provides similar results for the dynamic $(k,z)$-clustering problem. As the main result of this paper, we develop a randomized incremental $(k, z)$-clustering algorithm that maintains with high probability a constant-factor approximation in a graph undergoing edge insertions with a total update time of $\\tilde O(k m^{1+o(1)}+ k^{1+\\frac{1}{\\lambda}} m)$, where $\\lambda \\geq 1$ is an arbitrary fixed constant. Our incremental algorithm consists of two stages. In the first stage, we maintain a constant-factor bicriteria approximate solution of size $\\tilde{O}(k)$ with a total update time of $m^{1+o(1)}$ over all adversarial edge insertions. This first stage is an intricate adaptation of the bicriteria approximation algorithm by Mettu and Plaxton [Machine Learning 2004] to incremental graphs. One of our key technical results is that the radii in their algorithm can be assumed to be non-decreasing while the approximation ratio remains constant, a property that may be of independent interest. In the second stage, we maintain a constant-factor approximate $(k,z)$-clustering solution on a dynamic weighted instance induced by the bicriteria approximate solution. For this subproblem, we employ a dynamic spanner algorithm together with a static $(k,z)$-clustering algorithm.",

We show that this composition introduces a distinct security failure mode: a vector-retrieved \"seed\" chunk can pivot via entity links into sensitive graph neighborhoods, causing cross-tenant data leakage that does not occur in vector-only retrieval. We formalize this risk as Retrieval Pivot Risk (RPR) and introduce companion metrics Leakage@k, Amplification Factor, and Pivot Depth (PD) to quantify leakage magnitude and traversal structure. We present seven Retrieval Pivot Attacks that exploit the vector-to-graph boundary and show that adversarial injection is not required: naturally shared entities create cross-tenant pivot paths organically. Across a synthetic multi-tenant enterprise corpus and the Enron email corpus, the undefended hybrid pipeline exhibits high pivot risk (RPR up to 0.95) with multiple unauthorized items returned per query. Leakage consistently appears at PD=2, which we attribute to the bipartite chunk-entity topology and formalize as a proposition. We then show that enforcing authorization at a single location, the graph expansion boundary, eliminates measured leakage (RPR near 0) across both corpora, all attack variants, and label forgery rates up to 10 percent, with minimal overhead. Our results indicate the root cause is boundary enforcement, not inherently complex defenses: two individually secure retrieval components can compose into an insecure system unless authorization is re-checked at the transition point.",

Closed-source models such as GPT-4o achieve higher agreement and cross-model generalization than open-weight models such as Llama. Our findings position evaluation as a learned linguistic capability of LLMs, consistent within models but fragmented across them, and call for new methods that jointly model human and LLM evaluative language to improve reliability and interpretability.",

In such recent applications, in addition to the relevance (similarity) of the returned neighbors, diversity among the neighbors is a central requirement. In this paper, we develop principled welfare-based formulations in NNS for realizing diversity across attributes. Our formulations are based on welfare functions -- from mathematical economics -- that satisfy central diversity (fairness) and relevance (economic efficiency) axioms. With a particular focus on Nash social welfare, we note that our welfare-based formulations provide objective functions that adaptively balance relevance and diversity in a query-dependent manner. Notably, such a balance was not present in the prior constraint-based approach, which forced a fixed level of diversity and optimized for relevance. In addition, our formulation provides a parametric way to control the trade-off between relevance and diversity, providing practitioners with flexibility to tailor search results to task-specific requirements. We develop efficient nearest neighbor algorithms with provable guarantees for the welfare-based objectives. Notably, our algorithm can be applied on top of any standard ANN method (i.e., use standard ANN method as a subroutine) to efficiently find neighbors that approximately maximize our welfare-based objectives. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach is practical and substantially improves diversity while maintaining high relevance of the retrieved neighbors.",

In sequential decision making, efforts have been made towards personalization for different goals or values from demonstrations of diverse agents. However, these approaches demand manually designed features or lack value-based interpretability and/or adaptability to diverse user preferences. We propose algorithms for learning models of value alignment and value systems for a society of agents in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), based on clustering and preference-based multi-objective reinforcement learning (PbMORL). We jointly learn socially-derived value alignment models (groundings) and a set of value systems that concisely represent different groups of users (clusters) in a society. Each cluster consists of a value system representing the value-based preferences of its members and an approximately Pareto-optimal policy that reflects behaviours aligned with this value system. We evaluate our method against a state-of-the-art PbMORL algorithm and baselines on two MDPs with human values.",

Moreover, existing agentic recommendation systems predominantly leverages semantic knowledge while neglecting the collaborative filtering (CF) signals essential for implicit preference modeling. To address these limitations, we propose AMEM4Rec, an agentic LLM-based recommender that learns collaborative signals in an end-to-end manner through cross-user memory evolution. AMEM4Rec stores abstract user behavior patterns from user histories in a global memory pool. Within this pool, memories are linked to similar existing ones and iteratively evolved to reinforce shared cross-user patterns, enabling the system to become aware of CF signals without relying on a pre-trained CF model. Extensive experiments on Amazon and MIND datasets show that AMEM4Rec consistently outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based recommenders, demonstrating the effectiveness of evolving memory-guided collaborative filtering.",

Often originating from unconverged or inconsistent electronic-structure calculations, this noise is challenging to identify. Existing mitigation strategies such as manual filtering or iterative refinement of outliers, require either substantial expert effort or multiple expensive retraining cycles, making them difficult to scale to large datasets. Here, we introduce an on-the-fly outlier detection scheme that automatically down-weights noisy samples, without requiring additional reference calculations. By tracking the loss distribution via an exponential moving average, this unsupervised method identifies outliers throughout a single training run. We show that this approach prevents overfitting and matches the performance of iterative refinement baselines with significantly reduced overhead. The method's effectiveness is demonstrated by recovering accurate physical observables for liquid water from unconverged reference data, including diffusion coefficients. Furthermore, we validate its scalability by training a foundation model for organic chemistry on the SPICE dataset, where it reduces energy errors by a factor of three. This framework provides a simple, automated solution for training robust models on imperfect datasets across dataset sizes.",

However, prior work is primarily evaluated on natural-language benchmarks using task-level metrics, where token-level difficulty is unobservable and confounded with architectural factors, making it unclear whether compute allocation truly aligns with underlying complexity. We address this gap through three contributions. First, we introduce a complexity-controlled evaluation paradigm using algorithmic and synthetic language tasks with parameterized difficulty, enabling direct testing of token-level compute allocation. Second, we propose ANIRA, a unified recurrent Transformer framework that supports per-token variable-depth computation while isolating compute allocation decisions from other model factors. Third, we use this framework to conduct a systematic analysis of token-level adaptive computation across alignment with complexity, generalization, and decision timing. Our results show that compute allocation aligned with task complexity can emerge without explicit difficulty supervision, but such alignment does not imply algorithmic generalization: models fail to extrapolate to unseen input sizes despite allocating additional computation. We further find that early compute decisions rely on static structural cues, whereas online halting more closely tracks algorithmic execution state.",

A popular strategy is model-based policy evaluation, which estimates a model from data to infer counterfactual outcomes. This strategy is known to produce unwarrantedly optimistic estimates of the true benefit due to the winner's curse. We searched the recent literature on data-driven decision-making, identifying a sample of 55 papers published in the Management Science in the past decade; all but two relied on this flawed methodology. Several common justifications are provided: (1) the estimated models are accurate, stable, and well-calibrated, (2) the historical data uses random treatment assignment, (3) the model family is well-specified, and (4) the evaluation methodology uses sample splitting. Unfortunately, we show that no combination of these justifications avoids the winner's curse. First, we provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that the winner's curse can cause large, spurious reported benefits even when all these justifications hold. Second, we perform a simulation study based on the recent and consequential data-driven refugee matching problem. We construct a synthetic refugee matching environment (calibrated to closely match the real setting) but designed so that no assignment policy can improve expected employment compared to random assignment. Model-based methods report large, stable gains of around 60% even when the true effect is zero; these gains are on par with improvements of 22-75% reported in the literature. Our results provide strong evidence against model-based evaluation.",

Timely detection is critical as symptoms can escalate rapidly. Early recognition enables simple interventions such as descent, oxygen, or medication, and prompt treatment can save lives by significantly lowering the risk of severe complications. Although conventional machine learning (ML) techniques have been applied to identify altitude sickness using physiological signals, such as heart rate, oxygen saturation, respiration rate, blood pressure, and body temperature, they often struggle to balance predictive performance with low hardware demands. In contrast, hyperdimensional computing (HDC) remains under-explored for this task with limited biomedical features, where it may offer a compelling alternative to existing classification models. Its vector symbolic framework is inherently suited to hardware-efficient design, making it a strong candidate for low-power systems like wearables. Leveraging lightweight computation and efficient streamlined memory usage, HDC enables real-time detection of altitude sickness from physiological parameters collected by wearable devices, achieving accuracy comparable to that of traditional ML models. We present AMS-HD, a novel system that integrates tailored feature extraction and Hadamard HV encoding to enhance both the precision and efficiency of HDC-based detection.

        "abstract": "Regression neural networks (NNs) are most commonly trained by minimizing the mean squared prediction error, which is highly sensitive to outliers and data contamination. Existing robust training methods for regression NNs are often limited in scope and rely primarily on empirical validation, with only a few offering partial theoretical guarantees. In this paper, we propose a new robust learning framework for regression NNs based on the $\\beta$-divergence (also known as the density power divergence) which we call `rRNet'. It applies to a broad class of regression NNs, including models with non-smooth activation functions and error densities, and recovers the classical maximum likelihood learning as a special case. The rRNet is implemented via an alternating optimization scheme, for which we establish convergence guarantees to stationary points under mild, verifiable conditions. The (local) robustness of rRNet is theoretically characterized through the influence functions of both the parameter estimates and the resulting rRNet predictor, which are shown to be bounded for suitable choices of the tuning parameter $\\beta$, depending on the error density. We further prove that rRNet attains the optimal 50\\% asymptotic breakdown point at the assumed model for all $\\beta\\in(0, 1]$, providing a strong global robustness guarantee that is largely absent for existing NN learning methods. Our theoretical results are complemented by simulation experiments and real-data analyses, illustrating practical advantages of rRNet over existing approaches in both function approximation problems and prediction tasks with noisy observations.",

        "abstract": "The inability to communicate poses a major challenge to coordination in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Prior work has explored correlating local policies via shared randomness, sometimes in the form of a correlation device, as a mechanism to assist in decentralized decision-making. In contrast, this work introduces the first framework for training MARL agents to exploit shared quantum entanglement as a coordination resource, which permits a larger class of communication-free correlated policies than shared randomness alone. This is motivated by well-known results in quantum physics which posit that, for certain single-round cooperative games with no communication, shared quantum entanglement enables strategies that outperform those that only use shared randomness. In such cases, we say that there is quantum advantage. Our framework is based on a novel differentiable policy parameterization that enables optimization over quantum measurements, together with a novel policy architecture that decomposes joint policies into a quantum coordinator and decentralized local actors. To illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we first show that we can learn, purely from experience, strategies that attain quantum advantage in single-round games that are treated as black box oracles. We then demonstrate how our machinery can learn policies with quantum advantage in an illustrative multi-agent sequential decision-making problem formulated as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP).",

        "abstract": "Neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs) can effectively learn dynamical systems from time series data, but their behavior on graph-structured data remains poorly understood, especially when applied to graphs with different size or structure than encountered during training. We study neural ODEs ($\\mathtt{nODE}$s) with vector fields following the Barabási-Barzel form, trained on synthetic data from five common dynamical systems on graphs. Using the $\\mathbb{S}^1$-model to generate graphs with realistic and tunable structure, we find that degree heterogeneity and the type of dynamical system are the primary factors in determining $\\mathtt{nODE}$s' ability to generalize across graph sizes and properties. This extends to $\\mathtt{nODE}$s' ability to capture fixed points and maintain performance amid missing data. Average clustering plays a secondary role in determining $\\mathtt{nODE}$ performance. Our findings highlight $\\mathtt{nODE}$s as a powerful approach to understanding complex systems but underscore challenges emerging from degree heterogeneity and clustering in realistic graphs.",

        "abstract": "We study homology of ample groupoids via the compactly supported Moore complex of the nerve. Let $A$ be a topological abelian group. For $n\\ge 0$ set $C_n(\\mathcal G;A) := C_c(\\mathcal G_n,A)$ and define $\\partial_n^A=\\sum_{i=0}^n(-1)^i(d_i)_*$. This defines $H_n(\\mathcal G;A)$. The theory is functorial for continuous étale homomorphisms. It is compatible with standard reductions, including restriction to saturated clopen subsets. In the ample setting it is invariant under Kakutani equivalence. We reprove Matui type long exact sequences and identify the comparison maps at chain level. For discrete $A$ we prove a natural universal coefficient short exact sequence $$0\\to H_n(\\mathcal G)\\otimes_{\\mathbb Z}A\\xrightarrow{\\ \\iota_n^{\\mathcal G}\\ }H_n(\\mathcal G;A)\\xrightarrow{\\ \\kappa_n^{\\mathcal G}\\ }\\operatorname{Tor}_1^{\\mathbb Z}\\bigl(H_{n-1}(\\mathcal G),A\\bigr)\\to 0.$$ The key input is the chain level isomorphism $C_c(\\mathcal G_n,\\mathbb Z)\\otimes_{\\mathbb Z}A\\cong C_c(\\mathcal G_n,A)$, which reduces the groupoid statement to the classical algebraic UCT for the free complex $C_c(\\mathcal G_\\bullet,\\mathbb Z)$. We also isolate the obstruction for non-discrete coefficients. For a locally compact totally disconnected Hausdorff space $X$ with a basis of compact open sets, the image of $\\Phi_X:C_c(X,\\mathbb Z)\\otimes_{\\mathbb Z}A\\to C_c(X,A)$ is exactly the compactly supported functions with finite image. Thus $\\Phi_X$ is surjective if and only if every $f\\in C_c(X,A)$ has finite image, and for suitable $X$ one can produce compactly supported continuous maps $X\\to A$ with infinite image. Finally, for a clopen saturated cover $\\mathcal G_0=U_1\\cup U_2$ we construct a short exact sequence of Moore complexes and derive a Mayer-Vietoris long exact sequence for $H_\\bullet(\\mathcal G;A)$ for explicit computations.",

        "abstract": "The prevalent paradigm in robot learning attempts to generalize across environments, embodiments, and tasks with language prompts at runtime. A fundamental tension limits this approach: language is often too abstract to guide the concrete physical understanding required for robust manipulation. In this work, we introduce Contact-Anchored Policies (CAP), which replace language conditioning with points of physical contact in space. Simultaneously, we structure CAP as a library of modular utility models rather than a monolithic generalist policy. This factorization allows us to implement a real-to-sim iteration cycle: we build EgoGym, a lightweight simulation benchmark, to rapidly identify failure modes and refine our models and datasets prior to real-world deployment. We show that by conditioning on contact and iterating via simulation, CAP generalizes to novel environments and embodiments out of the box on three fundamental manipulation skills while using only 23 hours of demonstration data, and outperforms large, state-of-the-art VLAs in zero-shot evaluations by 56%. All model checkpoints, codebase, hardware, simulation, and datasets will be open-sourced. Project page: this https URL",
