        "abstract": "Judge agents are fundamental to agentic AI frameworks: they provide automated evaluation, and enable iterative self-refinement of reasoning processes. We introduce JAF: Judge Agent Forest, a framework in which the judge agent conducts joint inference across a cohort of query--response pairs generated by a primary agent, rather than evaluating each in isolation. This paradigm elevates the judge from a local evaluator to a holistic learner: by simultaneously assessing related responses, the judge discerns cross-instance patterns and inconsistencies, whose aggregate feedback enables the primary agent to improve by viewing its own outputs through the judge's collective perspective. Conceptually, JAF bridges belief propagation and ensemble-learning principles: overlapping in-context neighborhoods induce a knowledge-graph structure that facilitates propagation of critique, and repeated, randomized evaluations yield a robust ensemble of context-sensitive judgments. JAF can be instantiated entirely via ICL, with the judge prompted for each query using its associated primary-agent response plus a small, possibly noisy set of peer exemplars. While kNN in embedding space is a natural starting point for exemplars, this approach overlooks categorical structure, domain metadata, or nuanced distinctions accessible to modern LLMs. To overcome these limitations, we develop a flexible locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) algorithm that learns informative binary codes by integrating semantic embeddings, LLM-driven hash predicates, supervision from categorical labels, and relevant side information. These hash codes support efficient, interpretable, and relation-aware selection of diverse exemplars, and further optimize exploration of CoT reasoning paths. We validate JAF with an empirical study on the demanding task of cloud misconfigs triage in large-scale cloud environments.",

We introduce the Six Sigma Agent, a novel architecture that achieves enterprise-grade reliability through three synergistic components: (1) task decomposition into a dependency tree of atomic actions; (2) micro-agent sampling where each task is executed n times in parallel across diverse LLMs to generate independent outputs; and (3) consensus voting with dynamic scaling, clustering outputs and selecting the answer from the winning cluster with maximum votes. We prove that sampling n independent outputs with error rate p achieves system error O(p^{ceil(n/2)}), enabling exponential reliability gains. Even using cheaper models with 5% per-action error, consensus voting with 5 agents reduces error to 0.11%; dynamic scaling to 13 agents achieves 3.4 DPMO (Defects Per Million Opportunities), the Six Sigma standard. Evaluation across three enterprise use cases demonstrates a 14,700x reliability improvement over single-agent execution while reducing costs by 80%. Our work establishes that reliability in AI systems emerges from principled redundancy and consensus rather than model scaling alone.",

We argue that this failure reflects a fundamental mismatch: step-wise reasoning induces a form of step-wise greedy policy that is adequate for short horizons but fails in long-horizon planning, where early actions must account for delayed consequences. From this planning-centric perspective, we study LLM-based agents in deterministic, fully structured environments with explicit state transitions and evaluation signals. Our analysis reveals a core failure mode of reasoning-based policies: locally optimal choices induced by step-wise scoring lead to early myopic commitments that are systematically amplified over time and difficult to recover from. We introduce FLARE (Future-aware Lookahead with Reward Estimation) as a minimal instantiation of future-aware planning to enforce explicit lookahead, value propagation, and limited commitment in a single model, allowing downstream outcomes to influence early decisions. Across multiple benchmarks, agent frameworks, and LLM backbones, FLARE consistently improves task performance and planning-level behavior, frequently allowing LLaMA-8B with FLARE to outperform GPT-4o with standard step-by-step reasoning. These results establish a clear distinction between reasoning and planning.",

If LLMs are to participate in high-stakes decisions or serve as models of human behavior, it is critical to assess whether they exhibit analogous patterns of (ir)rationalities and biases. To this end, we evaluate multiple LLM families on (i) benchmarks testing core axioms of rational choice and (ii) classic decision domains from behavioral economics and social norms where emotions are known to shape judgment and choice. Across settings, we show that deliberate \"thinking\" reliably improves rationality and pushes models toward expected-value maximization. To probe human-like affective distortions and their interaction with reasoning, we use two emotion-steering methods: in-context priming (ICP) and representation-level steering (RLS). ICP induces strong directional shifts that are often extreme and difficult to calibrate, whereas RLS produces more psychologically plausible patterns but with lower reliability. Our results suggest that the same mechanisms that improve rationality also amplify sensitivity to affective interventions, and that different steering methods trade off controllability against human-aligned behavior. Overall, this points to a tension between reasoning and affective steering, with implications for both human simulation and the safe deployment of LLM-based decision systems.",

These protocols allow multiple agents to coordinate to come to a common agreement in an environment with uncertainty and failures. We formulate protocol design as a search problem over strategies in a game with imperfect information, and the desired correctness conditions are specified in Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT). However, standard methods for solving multi-agent games fail to learn correct protocols in this setting, even when the number of agents is small. We propose a learning framework, GGMS, which integrates a specialized variant of Monte Carlo Tree Search with a transformer-based action encoder, a global depth-first search to break out of local minima, and repeated feedback from a model checker. Protocols output by GGMS are verified correct via exhaustive model checking for all executions within the bounded setting. We further prove that, under mild assumptions, the search process is complete: if a correct protocol exists, GGMS will eventually find it. In experiments, we show that GGMS can learn correct protocols for larger settings than existing methods.",

Our findings suggest that the 'Open' status of the problems was through obscurity rather than difficulty.

This study presents an automated personnel selection system that utilizes sophisticated natural language processing (NLP) methods to assess and rank software engineering applicants. A distinctive dataset was created by aggregating LinkedIn profiles that include essential features such as education, work experience, abilities, and self-introduction, further enhanced with expert assessments to function as standards. The research combines large language models (LLMs) with multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) theory to develop the LLM-TOPSIS framework. In this context, we utilized the TOPSIS method enhanced by fuzzy logic (Fuzzy TOPSIS) to address the intrinsic ambiguity and subjectivity in human assessments. We utilized triangular fuzzy numbers (TFNs) to describe criteria weights and scores, thereby addressing the ambiguity frequently encountered in candidate evaluations. For candidate ranking, the DistilRoBERTa model was fine-tuned and integrated with the fuzzy TOPSIS method, achieving rankings closely aligned with human expert evaluations and attaining an accuracy of up to 91% for the Experience attribute and the Overall attribute. The study underlines the potential of NLP-driven frameworks to improve recruitment procedures by boosting scalability, consistency, and minimizing prejudice. Future endeavors will concentrate on augmenting the dataset, enhancing model interpretability, and verifying the system in actual recruitment scenarios to better evaluate its practical applicability. This research highlights the intriguing potential of merging NLP with fuzzy decision-making methods in personnel selection, enabling scalable and unbiased solutions to recruitment difficulties.",

To address this, we propose Betting Probably Approximately Correct (B-PAC) reasoning, a principled method that enables anytime safe and efficient online reasoning under partial feedback. Specifically, we utilize inverse propensity scoring estimators to construct test supermartingales for candidate thresholds, and then dynamically adjust the routing threshold based on the accumulated statistical evidence of safety. Theoretically, we establish the anytime-valid performance loss control and the efficiency of B-PAC reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that B-PAC reasoning significantly reduces computational overhead, decreasing thinking model usage by up to 81.01\\%, while controlling the performance loss below the user-specified level.",

Yet, despite their striking empirical progress, the core mechanisms driving their capabilities remain unelucidated, leaving a critical gap in theoretical understanding. This paper provides the first rigorous theoretical guarantees for SRLMs. We first establish a lower bound that characterizes the fundamental limits of a single update step, revealing a critical dependence on the quality of the initial model. We then derive finite-sample error bounds for the full iterative paradigm, showing that performance improves at a rate of $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}\\left(1/\\sqrt{n}\\right)$ with sample size $n$. Crucially, our analysis reveals that the dependence on the initial model decays exponentially with the number of iterations $T$. This provides a formal explanation for why self-rewarding succeeds: it robustly overcomes poor initialization by steering the dynamics toward internal stability and consistency. Finally, we instantiate our theoretical framework for the linear softmax model class, yielding tailored guarantees that connect our high-level insights to practical model architectures.",

While memory systems provide a viable solution, existing paradigms struggle to adapt to dynamic GUI environments, suffering from a granularity mismatch between high-level intent and low-level execution, and context pollution where the static accumulation of outdated experiences drives agents into hallucination. To address these bottlenecks, we propose the Darwinian Memory System (DMS), a self-evolving architecture that constructs memory as a dynamic ecosystem governed by the law of survival of the fittest. DMS decomposes complex trajectories into independent, reusable units for compositional flexibility, and implements Utility-driven Natural Selection to track survival value, actively pruning suboptimal paths and inhibiting high-risk plans. This evolutionary pressure compels the agent to derive superior strategies. Extensive experiments on real-world multi-app benchmarks validate that DMS boosts general-purpose MLLMs without training costs or architectural overhead, achieving average gains of 18.0% in success rate and 33.9% in execution stability, while reducing task latency, establishing it as an effective self-evolving memory system for GUI tasks.",

This leads to a research question: Can explicit feedback on table transformation action improve model reasoning capability? In this work, we introduce RE-Tab, a plug-and-play framework that architecturally enhances trajectory search via lightweight, training-free reward modeling by formulating the problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process. We demonstrate that providing explicit verifiable rewards during State Transition (``What is the best action?'') and Simulative Reasoning (``Am I sure about the output?'') is crucial to steer the agent's navigation in table states. By enforcing stepwise reasoning with reward feedback in table transformations, RE-Tab achieves state-of-the-art performance in TableQA with almost 25\\% drop in inference cost. Furthermore, a direct plug-and-play implementation of RE-Tab brings up to 41.77% improvement in QA accuracy and 33.33% drop in test-time inference samples for consistent answer. Consistent improvement pattern across various LLMs and state-of-the-art benchmarks further confirms RE-Tab's generalisability. The repository is available at this https URL .",

We uncover a novel phenomenon, embedding-space crowding, where the next-token distribution concentrates its probability mass on geometrically close tokens in the embedding space. We quantify crowding at multiple granularities and find a statistical association with reasoning success in mathematical problem solving.

However, existing frameworks often operate under the idealized assumption that tool executions are invariably successful, relying solely on textual descriptions that fail to distinguish precise performance boundaries and cannot adapt to iterative tool updates. This gap introduces uncertainty in planning and execution, particularly in domains like visual content generation (AIGC), where nuanced tool performance significantly impacts outcomes. To address this, we propose PerfGuard, a performance-aware agent framework for visual content generation that systematically models tool performance boundaries and integrates them into task planning and scheduling. Our framework introduces three core mechanisms: (1) Performance-Aware Selection Modeling (PASM), which replaces generic tool descriptions with a multi-dimensional scoring system based on fine-grained performance evaluations; (2) Adaptive Preference Update (APU), which dynamically optimizes tool selection by comparing theoretical rankings with actual execution rankings; and (3) Capability-Aligned Planning Optimization (CAPO), which guides the planner to generate subtasks aligned with performance-aware strategies. Experimental comparisons against state-of-the-art methods demonstrate PerfGuard's advantages in tool selection accuracy, execution reliability, and alignment with user intent, validating its robustness and practical utility for complex AIGC tasks.

Existing data-driven approaches that incorporate weather as auxiliary input often rely on coarse-grained descriptors and lack dedicated mechanisms to capture fine-grained spatio-temporal effects.

To address these limitations, we propose WED-Net (Weather-Effect Disentanglement Network), a dual-branch Transformer architecture that separates intrinsic and weather-induced traffic patterns via self- and cross-attention, enhanced with memory banks and fused through adaptive gating. To further promote disentanglement, we introduce a discriminator that explicitly distinguishes weather conditions. Additionally, we design a causal data augmentation strategy that perturbs non-causal parts while preserving causal structures, enabling improved generalization under rare scenarios. Experiments on taxi-flow datasets from three cities demonstrate that WED-Net delivers robust performance under extreme weather conditions, highlighting its potential to support safer mobility, highlighting its potential to support safer mobility, disaster preparedness, and urban resilience in real-world settings.

However, existing RLVR algorithms require large query budgets, making annotation costly. We investigate whether fewer but more informative queries can yield similar or superior performance, introducing active learning (AL) into RLVR. We identify that classic AL sampling strategies fail to outperform random selection in this setting, due to ignoring objective uncertainty when only selecting by subjective uncertainty. This work proposes an uncertainty consistency metric to evaluate how well subjective uncertainty aligns with objective uncertainty. In the offline setting, this alignment is measured using the Point-Biserial Correlation Coefficient (PBC). For online training, because of limited sampling and dynamically shifting output distributions, PBC estimation is difficult. Therefore, we introduce a new online variant, computed from normalized advantage and subjective uncertainty. Theoretically, we prove that the online variant is strictly negatively correlated with offline PBC and supports better sample selection. Experiments show our method consistently outperforms random and classic AL baselines, achieving full-dataset performance while training on only 30% of the data, effectively reducing the cost of RLVR for reasoning tasks.",

We propose a unified framework that combines a self-evolving data agent with verifier-based RL. Our system, EigenData, is a hierarchical multi-agent engine that synthesizes tool-grounded dialogues together with executable per-instance checkers, and improves generation reliability via closed-loop self-evolving process that updates prompts and workflow. Building on the synthetic data, we develop an RL recipe that first fine-tunes the user model and then applies GRPO-style training with trajectory-level group-relative advantages and dynamic filtering, yielding consistent improvements beyond SFT. Evaluated on tau^2-bench, our best model reaches 73.0% pass^1 on Airline and 98.3% pass^1 on Telecom, matching or exceeding frontier models.

In practice, attackers can exploit large-scale parallel sampling to repeatedly probe a model until a harmful response is produced. While recent work shows that attack success increases with repeated sampling, principled methods for predicting large-scale adversarial risk remain limited. We propose a scaling-aware Best-of-N estimation of risk, SABER, for modeling jailbreak vulnerability under Best-of-N sampling. We model sample-level success probabilities using a Beta distribution, the conjugate prior of the Bernoulli distribution, and derive an analytic scaling law that enables reliable extrapolation of large-N attack success rates from small-budget measurements. Using only n=100 samples, our anchored estimator predicts ASR@1000 with a mean absolute error of 1.66, compared to 12.04 for the baseline, which is an 86.2% reduction in estimation error. Our results reveal heterogeneous risk scaling profiles and show that models appearing robust under standard evaluation can experience rapid nonlinear risk amplification under parallel adversarial pressure.

But clinical reasoning is not text generation. It is a responsibility-bound process under ambiguity, incomplete evidence, and longitudinal context. Even as benchmark scores rise, generation-centric systems still show behaviours incompatible with clinical deployment: premature closure, unjustified certainty, intent drift, and instability across multi-step decisions. We argue these are structural consequences of treating medicine as next-token prediction. We formalise Clinical Contextual Intelligence (CCI) as a distinct capability class required for real-world clinical use, defined by persistent context awareness, intent preservation, bounded inference, and principled deferral when evidence is insufficient. We introduce Meddollina, a governance-first clinical intelligence system designed to constrain inference before language realisation, prioritising clinical appropriateness over generative completeness. Meddollina acts as a continuous intelligence layer supporting clinical workflows while preserving clinician authority. We evaluate Meddollina using a behaviour-first regime across 16,412+ heterogeneous medical queries, benchmarking against general-purpose models, medical-tuned models, and retrieval-augmented systems. Meddollina exhibits a distinct behavioural profile: calibrated uncertainty, conservative reasoning under underspecification, stable longitudinal constraint adherence, and reduced speculative completion relative to generation-centric baselines. These results suggest deployable medical AI will not emerge from scaling alone, motivating a shift toward Continuous Clinical Intelligence, where progress is measured by clinician-aligned behaviour under uncertainty rather than fluency-driven completion.",

Yet, their adaptability remains limited in dynamic environments, where constructing accurate and flexible world models is crucial for effective reasoning and decision-making. To address this challenge, we extend the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) paradigm to embodied agents. While conventional MoE architectures modularize knowledge into expert components with pre-trained routing, they remain rigid once deployed, making them less effective for adapting to unseen domains in dynamic environments. We therefore propose Test-time Mixture of World Models (TMoW), a framework that enhances adaptability to unseen and evolving domains. TMoW updates its routing function over world models at test time, unlike conventional MoE where the function remains fixed, enabling agents to recombine existing models and integrate new ones for continual adaptation. It achieves this through (i) multi-granular prototype-based routing, which adapts mixtures across object- to scene-level similarities, (ii) test-time refinement that aligns unseen domain features with prototypes during inference, and (iii) distilled mixture-based augmentation, which efficiently constructs new models from few-shot data and existing prototypes. We evaluate TMoW on VirtualHome, ALFWorld, and RLBench benchmarks, demonstrating strong performance in both zero-shot adaptation and few-shot expansion scenarios, and showing that it enables embodied agents to operate effectively in dynamic environments.",

However, existing RL paradigms such as GRPO often suffer from Advantage Bias due to binary decision spaces and static uncertainty rewards, inducing either excessive conservatism or overconfidence. To tackle this challenge, this paper unveils the root causes of reward hacking and overconfidence in current RL paradigms incorporating uncertainty-based rewards, based on which we propose the UnCertainty-Aware Policy Optimization (UCPO) framework. UCPO employs Ternary Advantage Decoupling to separate and independently normalize deterministic and uncertain rollouts, thereby eliminating advantage bias. Furthermore, a Dynamic Uncertainty Reward Adjustment mechanism is introduced to calibrate uncertainty weights in real-time according to model evolution and instance difficulty. Experimental results in mathematical reasoning and general tasks demonstrate that UCPO effectively resolves the reward imbalance, significantly improving the reliability and calibration of the model beyond their knowledge boundaries.",

However, existing approaches often overlook the specialization differences among available models, treating all LLMs as uniformly applicable regardless of task characteristics. This limits their ability to adapt to varying reasoning demands and task complexities. In this work, we propose Task-Aware LLM Council (TALC), a task-adaptive decision framework that integrates a council of LLMs with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to enable dynamic expert selection and efficient multi-step planning. Each LLM is equipped with a structured success memory profile derived from prior task trajectories, enabling semantic matching between current reasoning context and past successes. At each decision point, TALC routes control to the most contextually appropriate model and estimates node value using a dual-signal mechanism that fuses model-based evaluations with historical utility scores. These signals are adaptively weighted based on intra-node variance and used to guide MCTS selection, allowing the system to balance exploration depth with planning confidence. Experiments on WebShop, HumanEval, and the Game of 24 demonstrate that TALC achieves superior task success rates and improved search efficiency compared to strong baselines, validating the benefits of specialization-aware routing and adaptive planning.",

Prior mitigations primarily relies on surface semantic information and fails to efficiently address the misalignment between the reward model (RM) and the policy model caused by continuous policy distribution shifts. This inevitably leads to an increasing reward discrepancy, exacerbating reward overoptimization. To address these limitations, we introduce R2M (Real-Time Aligned Reward Model), a novel lightweight RLHF framework. R2M goes beyond vanilla reward models that solely depend on the semantic representations of a pretrained LLM. Instead, it leverages the evolving hidden states of the policy (namely policy feedback) to align with the real-time distribution shift of the policy during the RL process. This work points to a promising new direction for improving the performance of reward models through real-time utilization of feedback from policy models.",

However, these models suffer from inadaptability to fast-changing environments like the web, which can be alleviated by fine-tuning requiring expansive model training and data collection. In this work, we introduce a novel paradigm for enhancing agentic VLM policies at inference without policy retraining. Fundamentally, our approach decouples the VLM's role as a high-capacity action proposer from the final action selection mechanism. We keep the VLM policy frozen and use it to generate a set of candidate actions for a given state. Then, a lightweight, offline-trained Q-function reranks these candidates, and the agent executes the action with the highest estimated value. The main contribution is to apply the Q-function directly during inference for immediate policy improvement, and not offline to relabel data for policy retraining. We demonstrate on the academic WebVoyager benchmark that our method significantly boosts agent success rates, improving a Qwen2.5-VL-7B agent from 38.8% to 55.7% and a proprietary GPT-4.1 agent from 82.4% to 88.8%.",

        "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) post-training has increasingly demonstrated strong ability to elicit reasoning behaviors in large language models (LLMs). For training efficiency, rollouts are typically generated in an off-policy manner using an older sampling policy and then used to update the current target policy. To correct the resulting discrepancy between the sampling and target policies, most existing RL objectives rely on a token-level importance sampling ratio, primarily due to its computational simplicity and numerical stability. However, we observe that token-level correction often leads to unstable training dynamics when the degree of off-policyness is large. In this paper, we revisit LLM policy optimization under off-policy conditions and show that the theoretically rigorous correction term is the prefix importance ratio, and that relaxing it to a token-level approximation can induce instability in RL post-training. To stabilize LLM optimization under large off-policy drift, we propose a simple yet effective objective, Minimum Prefix Ratio (MinPRO). MinPRO replaces the unstable cumulative prefix ratio with a non-cumulative surrogate based on the minimum token-level ratio observed in the preceding prefix. Extensive experiments on both dense and mixture-of-experts LLMs, across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, demonstrate that MinPRO substantially improves training stability and peak performance in off-policy regimes.",

While existing methods typically rely on labor-intensive human demonstrations or automated model exploration to generate GUI trajectories, they lack fine-grained control over task difficulty. This fundamentally restricts learning effectiveness due to the mismatch between the training difficulty and the agent's capabilities. Inspired by how humans acquire skills through progressively challenging tasks, we propose MobileGen, a novel data generation framework that adaptively aligns training difficulty with the GUI agent's capability frontier. Specifically, MobileGen explicitly decouples task difficulty into structural (e.g., trajectory length) and semantic (e.g., task goal) dimensions. It then iteratively evaluates the agent on a curated prior dataset to construct a systematic profile of its capability frontier across these two dimensions. With this profile, the probability distribution of task difficulty is adaptively computed, from which the target difficulty for the next round of training can be sampled. Guided by the sampled difficulty, a multi-agent controllable generator is finally used to synthesize high-quality interaction trajectories along with corresponding task instructions. Extensive experiments show that MobileGen consistently outperforms existing data generation methods by improving the average performance of GUI agents by 1.57 times across multiple challenging benchmarks. This highlights the importance of capability-aligned data generation for effective mobile GUI agent training.",

While current language models are not conscious, they exhibit behaviors analogous to certain aspects of consciousness. This paper investigates the implementation of a leading theory of consciousness, Integrated Information Theory (IIT), within language models via a reward-based learning paradigm. IIT provides a formal, axiom-based mathematical framework for quantifying consciousness. Drawing inspiration from its core principles, we formulate a novel reward function that quantifies a text's causality, coherence and integration, characteristics associated with conscious processing. Empirically, it is found that optimizing for this IIT-inspired reward leads to more concise text generation. On out of domain tasks, careful tuning achieves up to a 31% reduction in output length while preserving accuracy levels comparable to the base model. In addition to primary task performance, the broader effects of this training methodology on the model's confidence calibration and test-time computational scaling is analyzed. The proposed framework offers significant practical advantages: it is conceptually simple, computationally efficient, requires no external data or auxiliary models, and leverages a general, capability-driven signal rather than task-specific heuristics.

We propose Algorithm Space Response Oracles (ASRO), a game-theoretic framework that reframes heuristic discovery as a program level co-evolution between solver and instance generator. ASRO models their interaction as a two-player zero-sum game, maintains growing strategy pools on both sides, and iteratively expands them via LLM-based best-response oracles against mixed opponent meta-strategies, thereby replacing static evaluation with an adaptive, self-generated curriculum. Across multiple combinatorial optimization domains, ASRO consistently outperforms static-training AHD baselines built on the same program search mechanisms, achieving substantially improved generalization and robustness on diverse and out-of-distribution instances.",

In this paper, we investigate how to leverage richer verbal feedback to guide RLVR training on failed samples, and how to convert such feedback into a trainable learning signal. Specifically, we propose a multi-turn feedback-guided reinforcement learning framework. It builds on three mechanisms: (1) dynamic multi-turn regeneration guided by feedback, triggered only on failed samples, (2) two complementary learning signals for within-turn and cross-turn optimization, and (3) structured feedback injection into the model's reasoning process.

        "abstract": "A fundamental question in cognitive science and AI concerns whether different learning modalities: language, vision, and action, give rise to distinct or shared internal representations. Traditional views assume that models trained on different data types develop specialized, non-transferable representations. However, recent evidence suggests unexpected convergence: models optimized for distinct tasks may develop similar representational geometries. We investigate whether this convergence extends to embodied action learning by training a transformer-based agent to execute goal-directed behaviors in response to natural language instructions. Using behavioral cloning on the BabyAI platform, we generated action-grounded language embeddings shaped exclusively by sensorimotor control requirements. We then compared these representations with those extracted from state-of-the-art large language models (LLaMA, Qwen, DeepSeek, BERT) and vision-language models (CLIP, BLIP). Despite substantial differences in training data, modality, and objectives, we observed robust cross-modal alignment. Action representations aligned strongly with decoder-only language models and BLIP (precision@15: 0.70-0.73), approaching the alignment observed among language models themselves. Alignment with CLIP and BERT was significantly weaker. These findings indicate that linguistic, visual, and action representations converge toward partially shared semantic structures, supporting modality-independent semantic organization and highlighting potential for cross-domain transfer in embodied AI systems.",

However, real-world diagnosis is an iterative inquiry where Clinicians sequentially ask questions and order tests to strategically gather information while managing cost and time. To address this, we first propose Med-Inquire, a new benchmark designed to evaluate an agent's ability to perform multi-turn diagnosis. Built upon a dataset of real-world clinical cases, Med-Inquire simulates the diagnostic process by hiding a complete patient file behind specialized Patient and Examination agents. They force the agent to proactively ask questions and order tests to gather information piece by piece. To tackle the challenges posed by Med-Inquire, we then introduce EvoClinician, a self-evolving agent that learns efficient diagnostic strategies at test time. Its core is a ''Diagnose-Grade-Evolve'' loop: an Actor agent attempts a diagnosis; a Process Grader agent performs credit assignment by evaluating each action for both clinical yield and resource efficiency; finally, an Evolver agent uses this feedback to update the Actor's strategy by evolving its prompt and memory. Our experiments show EvoClinician outperforms continual learning baselines and other self-evolving agents like memory agents. The code is available at this https URL",

Yet, scaling up RL is bottlenecked by limited existing verifiable data, where improvements increasingly saturate over prolonged training. To overcome this, we propose Golden Goose, a simple trick to synthesize unlimited RLVR tasks from unverifiable internet text by constructing a multiple-choice question-answering version of the fill-in-the-middle task. Given a source text, we prompt an LLM to identify and mask key reasoning steps, then generate a set of diverse, plausible distractors. This enables us to leverage reasoning-rich unverifiable corpora typically excluded from prior RLVR data construction (e.g., science textbooks) to synthesize GooseReason-0.7M, a large-scale RLVR dataset with over 0.7 million tasks spanning mathematics, programming, and general scientific domains. Empirically, GooseReason effectively revives models saturated on existing RLVR data, yielding robust, sustained gains under continuous RL and achieving new state-of-the-art results for 1.5B and 4B-Instruct models across 15 diverse benchmarks. Finally, we deploy Golden Goose in a real-world setting, synthesizing RLVR tasks from raw FineWeb scrapes for the cybersecurity domain, where no prior RLVR data exists. Training Qwen3-4B-Instruct on the resulting data GooseReason-Cyber sets a new state-of-the-art in cybersecurity, surpassing a 7B domain-specialized model with extensive domain-specific pre-training and post-training. This highlights the potential of automatically scaling up RLVR data by exploiting abundant, reasoning-rich, unverifiable internet text.",

Here, we introduce a statistical framework for auditing model uniqueness based on In-Silico Quasi-Experimental Design (ISQED). By enforcing matched interventions across models, we isolate intrinsic model identity and quantify uniqueness as the Peer-Inexpressible Residual (PIER), i.e. the component of a target's behavior strictly irreducible to any stochastic convex combination of its peers, with vanishing PIER characterizing when such a routing-based substitution becomes possible. We establish the theoretical foundations of ecosystem auditing through three key contributions. First, we prove a fundamental limitation of observational logs: uniqueness is mathematically non-identifiable without intervention control. Second, we derive a scaling law for active auditing, showing that our adaptive query protocol achieves minimax-optimal sample efficiency ($d\\sigma^2\\gamma^{-2}\\log(Nd/\\delta)$). Third, we demonstrate that cooperative game-theoretic methods, such as Shapley values, fundamentally fail to detect redundancy. We implement this framework via the DISCO (Design-Integrated Synthetic Control) estimator and deploy it across diverse ecosystems, including computer vision models (ResNet/ConvNeXt/ViT), large language models (BERT/RoBERTa), and city-scale traffic forecasters. These results move trustworthy AI beyond explaining single models: they establish a principled, intervention-based science of auditing and governing heterogeneous model ecosystems.",

We introduce the PIES Taxonomy to categorize hallucinations along functional components (Planning vs. Summarization) and error properties (Explicit vs. Implicit). We instantiate this taxonomy into a fine-grained evaluation framework that decomposes the trajectory to rigorously quantify these hallucinations. Leveraging this framework to isolate 100 distinctively hallucination-prone tasks including adversarial scenarios, we curate DeepHalluBench. Experiments on six state-of-theart DRAs reveal that no system achieves robust reliability. Furthermore, our diagnostic analysis traces the etiology of these failures to systemic deficits, specifically hallucination propagation and cognitive biases, providing foundational insights to guide future architectural optimization.

This setting complicates assurance, because behavior depends on nondeterministic environments and probabilistic model outputs. Prior work introduced runtime verification for agentic AI via Dynamic Probabilistic Assurance (DPA), learning an MDP online and model checking quantitative properties. A key limitation is that developers must manually define the state abstraction, which couples verification to application-specific heuristics and increases adoption friction. This paper proposes TriCEGAR, a trace-driven abstraction mechanism that automates state construction from execution logs and supports online construction of an agent behavioral MDP. TriCEGAR represents abstractions as predicate trees learned from traces and refined using counterexamples. We describe a framework-native implementation that (i) captures typed agent lifecycle events, (ii) builds abstractions from traces, (iii) constructs an MDP, and (iv) performs probabilistic model checking to compute bounds such as Pmax(success) and Pmin(failure).

Specifically, in the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage, AutoTraj generates multiple candidate tool-use trajectories for each query and evaluates them along multiple dimensions. High-quality trajectories are directly retained, while low-quality ones are repaired using a LLM (i.e., LLM-as-Repairer). The resulting repaired and high-quality trajectories form a synthetic SFT dataset, while each repaired trajectory paired with its original low-quality counterpart constitutes a dataset for trajectory preference modeling. In the reinforcement learning (RL) stage, based on the preference dataset, we train a trajectory-level reward model to assess the quality of reasoning paths and combine it with outcome and format rewards, thereby explicitly guiding the optimization toward reliable TIR behaviors.

It is therefore important to understand how extremely capable AI models will fail: Will they fail by systematically pursuing goals we do not intend? Or will they fail by being a hot mess, and taking nonsensical actions that do not further any goal? We operationalize this question using a bias-variance decomposition of the errors made by AI models: An AI's \\emph{incoherence} on a task is measured over test-time randomness as the fraction of its error that stems from variance rather than bias in task outcome. Across all tasks and frontier models we measure, the longer models spend reasoning and taking actions, \\emph{the more incoherent} their failures become. Incoherence changes with model scale in a way that is experiment dependent. However, in several settings, larger, more capable models are more incoherent than smaller models. Consequently, scale alone seems unlikely to eliminate incoherence. Instead, as more capable AIs pursue harder tasks, requiring more sequential action and thought, our results predict failures to be accompanied by more incoherent behavior. This suggests a future where AIs sometimes cause industrial accidents (due to unpredictable misbehavior), but are less likely to exhibit consistent pursuit of a misaligned goal. This increases the relative importance of alignment research targeting reward hacking or goal misspecification.",

We study this gap through contextual mathematical reasoning, where the mathematical core must be formulated from descriptive scenarios. We introduce ContextMATH, a benchmark that repurposes AIME and MATH-500 problems into two contextual settings: Scenario Grounding (SG), which embeds abstract problems into realistic narratives without increasing reasoning complexity, and Complexity Scaling (CS), which transforms explicit conditions into sub-problems to capture how constraints often appear in practice. Evaluating 61 proprietary and open-source models, we observe sharp drops: on average, open-source models decline by 13 and 34 points on SG and CS, while proprietary models drop by 13 and 20. Error analysis shows that errors are dominated by incorrect problem formulation, with formulation accuracy declining as original problem difficulty increases. Correct formulation emerges as a prerequisite for success, and its sufficiency improves with model scale, indicating that larger models advance in both understanding and reasoning. Nevertheless, formulation and reasoning remain two complementary bottlenecks that limit contextual mathematical problem solving. Finally, we find that fine-tuning with scenario data improves performance, whereas formulation-only training is ineffective.

        "abstract": "Medical calculators are fundamental to quantitative, evidence-based clinical practice. However, their real-world use is an adaptive, multi-stage process, requiring proactive EHR data acquisition, scenario-dependent calculator selection, and multi-step computation, whereas current benchmarks focus only on static single-step calculations with explicit instructions. To address these limitations, we introduce MedMCP-Calc, the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs in realistic medical calculator scenarios through Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration. MedMCP-Calc comprises 118 scenario tasks across 4 clinical domains, featuring fuzzy task descriptions mimicking natural queries, structured EHR database interaction, external reference retrieval, and process-level evaluation. Our evaluation of 23 leading models reveals critical limitations: even top performers like Claude Opus 4.5 exhibit substantial gaps, including difficulty selecting appropriate calculators for end-to-end workflows given fuzzy queries, poor performance in iterative SQL-based database interactions, and marked reluctance to leverage external tools for numerical computation. Performance also varies considerably across clinical domains. Building on these findings, we develop CalcMate, a fine-tuned model incorporating scenario planning and tool augmentation, achieving state-of-the-art performance among open-source models.

CoT is also a powerful tool for monitoring the behaviours of these agents: when faithful, they offer interpretations of the model's decision making process, and an early warning sign for dangerous behaviours. However, optimisation pressures placed on the CoT may cause the model to obfuscate reasoning traces, losing this beneficial property. We show that obfuscation can generalise across tasks; models that learn to obfuscate reasoning involving reward hacking (e.g. accessing and utilising leaked information) generalise both the reward hacking behaviour and its obfuscation in CoT to unseen reward hacking settings. Most worryingly, we show that obfuscation of CoT reasoning, and its generalisation across tasks, also follows when we penalise only the model's final actions after closing its CoT. Our findings suggest that current practices of penalising harmful generations may inadvertently lead to a reduction in the broader monitorability of LLMs in unpredictable ways.",

We present RAudit, a diagnostic protocol for auditing LLM reasoning without ground truth access. The key constraint is blindness: the auditor evaluates only whether derivation steps support conclusions, enabling detection of trace-output inconsistency and, when latent competence exists, its recovery. RAudit measures process quality via CRIT-based reasonableness scores and varies critique formulation to study how social framing affects model response. We prove bounded correction and $O(\\log(1/\\epsilon))$ termination. Experiments on mathematical reasoning (CAP-GSM8K) and causal judgment (CausalL2) reveal four mechanisms explaining model unreliability: (1) Latent Competence Suppression, where models derive correct answers then overwrite them under social pressure; (2) The False Competence Trap, where weaker judges mask sycophancy that stronger judges expose; (3) The Complexity-Vulnerability Tradeoff, where causal tasks induce more than 10 times higher sycophancy than mathematical tasks; and (4) Iatrogenic Critique, where authoritative correction harms weaker models.

However, this over-optimization often prioritizes compliance, making models vulnerable to harmful prompts. To mitigate this safety degradation, recent approaches rely on external teacher distillation, yet this introduces a distributional discrepancy that degrades native reasoning. We propose ThinkSafe, a self-generated alignment framework that restores safety alignment without external teachers. Our key insight is that while compliance suppresses safety mechanisms, models often retain latent knowledge to identify harm. ThinkSafe unlocks this via lightweight refusal steering, guiding the model to generate in-distribution safety reasoning traces. Fine-tuning on these self-generated responses effectively realigns the model while minimizing distribution shift. Experiments on DeepSeek-R1-Distill and Qwen3 show ThinkSafe significantly improves safety while preserving reasoning proficiency. Notably, it achieves superior safety and comparable reasoning to GRPO, with significantly reduced computational cost. Code, models, and datasets are available at this https URL.",

We instead study a more stringent setting, Universal Targeted Transferable Adversarial Attacks (UTTAA), where a single perturbation must consistently steer arbitrary inputs toward a specified target across unknown commercial MLLMs. Naively adapting existing sample-wise attacks to this universal setting faces three core difficulties: (i) target supervision becomes high-variance due to target-crop randomness, (ii) token-wise matching is unreliable because universality suppresses image-specific cues that would otherwise anchor alignment, and (iii) few-source per-target adaptation is highly initialization-sensitive, which can degrade the attainable performance. In this work, we propose MCRMO-Attack, which stabilizes supervision via Multi-Crop Aggregation with an Attention-Guided Crop, improves token-level reliability through alignability-gated Token Routing, and meta-learns a cross-target perturbation prior that yields stronger per-target solutions. Across commercial MLLMs, we boost unseen-image attack success rate by +23.7\\% on GPT-4o and +19.9\\% on Gemini-2.0 over the strongest universal baseline.",

Due to their large size, they are often accessed in the cloud, limiting their application in offline games. Many of these practical issues are solved by pivoting to small language models (SLMs), but existing studies using SLMs have resulted in poor output quality. We propose a strategy of achieving high-quality SLM generation through aggressive fine-tuning on deliberately scoped tasks with narrow context, constrained structure, or both. In short, more difficult tasks require narrower scope and higher specialization to the training corpus. Training data is synthetically generated via a DAG-based approach, grounding models in the specific game world. Such models can form the basis for agentic networks designed around the narratological framework at hand, representing a more practical and robust solution than cloud-dependent LLMs. To validate this approach, we present a proof-of-concept focusing on a single specialized SLM as the fundamental building block. We introduce a minimal RPG loop revolving around rhetorical battles of reputations, powered by this model. We demonstrate that a simple retry-until-success strategy reaches adequate quality (as defined by an LLM-as-a-judge scheme) with predictable latency suitable for real-time generation. While local quality assessment remains an open question, our results demonstrate feasibility for real-time generation under typical game engine constraints.",

Through assigning credit to individual agent actions rather than only at task completion, MAPPA enables fine-grained supervision without ground truth labels while extracting maximal training signal from each rollout. We demonstrate our approach on competition math problems and tool-augmented data analysis tasks. On unseen math problems, MAPPA achieves +5.0--17.5pp on AIME and +7.8--17.2pp on AMC. For data analysis tasks, our method improves success rate by +12.5pp while quality metrics improve by up to 30%, validating that per-action supervision can lead to improvements across different multiagent system on various domains.

Shortest Anypath routing offers a solution by adapting routing decisions based on real-time link conditions. However, the effectiveness of such routing is fundamentally dependent on the quality and reliability of the available links, and predicting these variables with certainty is challenging. This paper introduces a novel approach that leverages the Deterministic Sequencing of Exploration and Exploitation (DSEE), a multi-armed bandit algorithm, to address the need for accurate and real-time estimation of link delivery probabilities. This approach augments the reliability and resilience of the Shortest Anypath routing in the face of fluctuating link conditions. By coupling DSEE with Anypath routing, this algorithm continuously learns and ensures accurate delivery probability estimation and selects the most suitable way to efficiently route packets while maintaining a provable near-logarithmic regret bound. We also theoretically prove that our proposed scheme offers better regret scaling with respect to the network size than the previously proposed Thompson Sampling-based Opportunistic Routing (TSOR).",

In the Screen stage, a multi-dimensional, quality-aware mechanism with adaptive thresholds dynamically selects informative frames; the Cache stage maintains a reference pool using a dynamic replacement-hit strategy, preserving both diversity and relevance; and the Match stage extracts behavioral features to perform motion-consistent reference matching for coherent animation guidance. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that FrameCache consistently improves temporal coherence and visual stability while integrating seamlessly with diverse baselines. Despite these encouraging results, further analysis reveals that its effectiveness depends on baseline temporal reasoning and real-synthetic consistency, motivating future work on compatibility conditions and adaptive cache mechanisms.

Further error analysis reveals systematic deficiencies in current models. UniFinEval aims to provide a systematic assessment of MLLMs' capabilities in fine-grained, high-information-density financial environments, thereby enhancing the robustness of MLLMs applications in real-world financial scenarios.

        "abstract": "Algorithmic stablecoins promise decentralized monetary stability by maintaining a target peg through programmatic reserve management. Yet, their reserve controllers remain vulnerable to regime-blind optimization, calibrating risk parameters on fair-weather data while ignoring tail events that precipitate cascading failures. The March 2020 Black Thursday collapse, wherein MakerDAO's collateral auctions yielded $8.3M in losses and a 15% peg deviation, exposed a critical gap: existing models like SAS systematically omit extreme volatility regimes from covariance estimates, producing allocations optimal in expectation but catastrophic under adversarial stress. We present MVF-Composer, a trust-weighted Mean-Variance Frontier reserve controller incorporating a novel Stress Harness for risk-state estimation. Our key insight is deploying multi-agent simulations as adversarial stress-testers: heterogeneous agents (traders, liquidity providers, attackers) execute protocol actions under crisis scenarios, exposing reserve vulnerabilities before they manifest on-chain. We formalize a trust-scoring mechanism T: A -> [0,1] that down-weights signals from agents exhibiting manipulative behavior, ensuring the risk-state estimator remains robust to signal injection and Sybil attacks. Across 1,200 randomized scenarios with injected Black-Swan shocks (10% collateral drawdown, 50% sentiment collapse, coordinated redemption attacks), MVF-Composer reduces peak peg deviation by 57% and mean recovery time by 3.1x relative to SAS baselines. Ablation studies confirm the trust layer accounts for 23% of stability gains under adversarial conditions, achieving 72% adversarial agent detection. Our system runs on commodity hardware, requires no on-chain oracles beyond standard price feeds, and provides a reproducible framework for stress-testing DeFi reserve policies.",

We investigate three mechanisms for inducing drunk language in LLMs: persona-based prompting, causal fine-tuning, and reinforcement-based post-training. When evaluated on 5 LLMs, we observe a higher susceptibility to jailbreaking on JailbreakBench (even in the presence of defences) and privacy leaks on ConfAIde, where both benchmarks are in English, as compared to the base LLMs as well as previously reported approaches. Via a robust combination of manual evaluation and LLM-based evaluators and analysis of error categories, our findings highlight a correspondence between human-intoxicated behaviour, and anthropomorphism in LLMs induced with drunk language. The simplicity and efficiency of our drunk language inducement approaches position them as potential counters for LLM safety tuning, highlighting significant risks to LLM safety.",

        "abstract": "Webshells remain a primary foothold for attackers to compromise servers, particularly within PHP ecosystems. However, existing detection mechanisms often struggle to keep pace with rapid variant evolution and sophisticated obfuscation techniques that camouflage malicious intent. Furthermore, many current defenses suffer from high false-alarm rates when encountering benign administrative scripts that employ heavy obfuscation for intellectual property protection. To address these challenges, we present ShellForge, an adversarial co-evolution framework that couples automated webshell generation with multi-view detection to continuously harden defensive boundaries. The framework operates through an iterative co-training loop where a generator and a detector mutually reinforce each other via the exchange of hard samples. The generator is optimized through supervised fine-tuning and preference-based reinforcement learning to synthesize functional, highly evasive variants. Simultaneously, we develop a multi-view fusion detector that integrates semantic features from long-string compression, structural features from pruned abstract syntax trees, and global statistical indicators such as Shannon entropy. To minimize false positives, ShellForge utilizes a LLM-based transformation to create de-malicious samples--scripts that retain complex obfuscation patterns but lack harmful payloads--serving as high-quality hard negatives during training. Evaluations on the public FWOID benchmark demonstrate that ShellForge significantly enhances defensive robustness. Upon convergence, the detector maintains a 0.981 F1-score while the generator achieves a 0.939 evasion rate against commercial engines on VirusTotal.",

A k Nearest Neighbor (kNN) query is one such example that finds the k closest POIs from an agent's location. While most existing techniques focus on retrieving nearby POIs for a single agent, these search heuristics do not translate to many other applications. For example, Aggregate k Nearest Neighbor (AkNN) queries require POIs that are close to multiple agents. k Farthest Neighbor (kFN) queries require POIs that are the antithesis of nearest. Such problems naturally benefit from a hierarchical approach, but existing methods rely on Euclidean-based heuristics, which have diminished effectiveness in graphs such as road networks. We propose a novel data structure, COL-Tree (Compacted Object-Landmark Tree), to address this gap by enabling efficient hierarchical graph traversal using a more accurate landmark-based heuristic. We then present query algorithms that utilize COL-Trees to efficiently answer AkNN, kFN, and other queries. In our experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets, we demonstrate that our techniques significantly outperform existing approaches, achieving up to 4 orders of magnitude improvement. Moreover, this comes at a small pre-processing overhead in both theory and practice.",

Performance is first evaluated on a quantum simulator and subsequently validated on NISQ-era superconducting quantum hardware, specifically the IBM Torino (133-qubit) and IBM Fez (156-qubit) processors. Experimental results demonstrate that the QSVM achieves competitive classification performance relative to classical SVM baselines while operating on substantially reduced feature dimensionality. Hardware experiments reveal the impact of noise and decoherence and measurement shot count on quantum kernel estimation, and further show improved stability and fidelity on newer Heron r2 architecture. This study provides a systematic comparison between simulator-based and hardware-based QSVM implementations and highlights both the feasibility and current limitations of deploying quantum kernel methods for practical radar signal classification tasks.",

Existing recommender systems -- largely built for item-level ranking from flat user-item logs -- do not directly address the structured, sequential, and interaction-dependent nature of agent orchestration. We address this gap by \\textbf{formulating agent recommendation in MAS as a constrained decision problem} and introducing a generic \\textbf{constrained recommendation framework} that first uses retrieval to build a compact candidate set conditioned on the current subtask and context, and then performs \\textbf{utility optimization} within this feasible set using a learned scorer that accounts for relevance, reliability, and interaction effects. We ground both the formulation and learning signals in \\textbf{historical calling trees}, which capture the execution structure of MAS (parent-child calls, branching dependencies, and local cooperation patterns) beyond what flat logs provide. The framework supports two complementary settings: \\textbf{agent-level recommendation} (select the next agent/tool) and \\textbf{system-level recommendation} (select a small, connected agent team/subgraph for coordinated execution). To enable systematic evaluation, we construct a unified calling-tree benchmark by normalizing invocation logs from eight heterogeneous multi-agent corpora into a shared structured representation.",

As both offensive and defensive prompt injection techniques evolve quickly, a structured understanding of mitigation strategies becomes increasingly important. To address that, this work presents the first systematic literature review on prompt injection mitigation strategies, comprehending 88 studies. Building upon NIST's report on adversarial machine learning, this work contributes to the field through several avenues. First, it identifies studies beyond those documented in NIST's report and other academic reviews and surveys. Second, we propose an extension to NIST taxonomy by introducing additional categories of defenses. Third, by adopting NIST's established terminology and taxonomy as a foundation, we promote consistency and enable future researchers to build upon the standardized taxonomy proposed in this work. Finally, we provide a comprehensive catalog of the reviewed prompt injection defenses, documenting their reported quantitative effectiveness across specific LLMs and attack datasets, while also indicating which solutions are open-source and model-agnostic. This catalog, together with the guidelines presented herein, aims to serve as a practical resource for researchers advancing the field of adversarial machine learning and for developers seeking to implement effective defenses in production systems.",

Watermarking is a promising approach, but existing methods either provide only binary signals or distort the sampling distribution, degrading text quality; distortion-free approaches, in turn, often suffer from weak detectability or robustness. We propose MirrorMark, a multi-bit and distortion-free watermark for LLMs. By mirroring sampling randomness in a measure-preserving manner, MirrorMark embeds multi-bit messages without altering the token probability distribution, preserving text quality by design. To improve robustness, we introduce a context-based scheduler that balances token assignments across message positions while remaining resilient to insertions and deletions. We further provide a theoretical analysis of the equal error rate to interpret empirical performance. Experiments show that MirrorMark matches the text quality of non-watermarked generation while achieving substantially stronger detectability: with 54 bits embedded in 300 tokens, it improves bit accuracy by 8-12% and correctly identifies up to 11% more watermarked texts at 1% false positive rate.",

        "abstract": "This article sets off for an exploration of the still evolving discourse surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) in the wake of the release of ChatGPT. It scrutinizes the pervasive narratives that are shaping the societal engagement with AI, spotlighting key themes such as agency and decision-making, autonomy, truthfulness, knowledge processing, prediction, general purpose, neutrality and objectivity, apolitical optimization, sustainability game-changer, democratization, mass unemployment, and the dualistic portrayal of AI as either a harbinger of societal utopia or dystopia. Those narratives are analysed critically based on insights from critical computer science, critical data and algorithm studies, from STS, data protection theory, as well as from the philosophy of mind and semiotics. To properly analyse the narratives presented, the article first delves into a historical and technical contextualisation of the AI discourse itself. The article then introduces the notion of \"Zeitgeist AI\" to critique the imprecise and misleading application of the term \"AI\" across various societal sectors. Then, by discussing common narratives with nuance, the article contextualises and challenges often assumed socio-political implications of AI, uncovering in detail and with examples the inherent political, power infused and value-laden decisions within all AI applications. Concluding with a call for a more grounded engagement with AI, the article carves out acute problems ignored by the narratives discussed and proposes new narratives recognizing AI as a human-directed tool necessarily subject to societal governance.",

In practice, however, pipeline jobs often fail intermittently due to non-deterministic tests, network outages, infrastructure failures, resource exhaustion, and other reliability issues. These intermittent (flaky) job failures lead to substantial inefficiencies: wasted computational resources from repeated reruns and significant diagnosis time that distracts developers from core activities and often requires intervention from specialized teams. Prior work has proposed machine learning techniques to detect intermittent failures, but does not address the subsequent diagnosis challenge. To fill this gap, we introduce FlaXifyer, a few-shot learning approach for predicting intermittent job failure categories using pre-trained language models. FlaXifyer requires only job execution logs and achieves 84.3% Macro F1 and 92.0% Top-2 accuracy with just 12 labeled examples per category. We also propose LogSift, an interpretability technique that identifies influential log statements in under one second, reducing review effort by 74.4% while surfacing relevant failure information in 87% of cases. Evaluation on 2,458 job failures from TELUS demonstrates that FlaXifyer and LogSift enable effective automated triage, accelerate failure diagnosis, and pave the way towards the automated resolution of intermittent job failures.",

In this work, we revisit RC through the lens of structured operators and state space modeling to address these limitations, introducing Parallel Echo State Network (ParalESN). ParalESN enables the construction of high-dimensional and efficient reservoirs based on diagonal linear recurrence in the complex space, enabling parallel processing of temporal data. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that ParalESN preserves the Echo State Property and the universality guarantees of traditional Echo State Networks while admitting an equivalent representation of arbitrary linear reservoirs in the complex diagonal form. Empirically, ParalESN matches the predictive accuracy of traditional RC on time series benchmarks, while delivering substantial computational savings. On 1-D pixel-level classification tasks, ParalESN achieves competitive accuracy with fully trainable neural networks while reducing computational costs and energy consumption by orders of magnitude. Overall, ParalESN offers a promising, scalable, and principled pathway for integrating RC within the deep learning landscape.",

To address this issue, we propose a systematic conformal prediction approach tailored to conditional generative models, leveraging density estimation on model-generated samples. We introduce a novel method called CP4Gen, which utilizes clustering-based density estimation to construct prediction sets that are less sensitive to outliers, more interpretable, and of lower structural complexity than existing methods. Extensive experiments on synthetic datasets and real-world applications, including climate emulation tasks, demonstrate that CP4Gen consistently achieves superior performance in terms of prediction set volume and structural simplicity. Our approach offers practitioners a powerful tool for uncertainty estimation associated with conditional generative models, particularly in scenarios demanding rigorous and interpretable prediction sets.",

This qualitative study examines how clinicians (n=12) perceive different interaction modalities (text-based conversation with LLMs, interactive and static UI, and voice) for decision-support. In open-ended use of LLM-based tools, our participants took a tool-centric approach using them for information retrieval and confirmation with simple prompts instead of use as active deliberation partners that can handle complex questions. Critical engagement emerged with changes to the interaction setup. Engagement also differed with individual cognitive styles. Lastly, benefits and drawbacks of interaction with text, voice and traditional UIs for clinical decision-support show the lack of a one-size-fits-all interaction modality.",

While this reduces the overhead of full-vector rotations, the effect of block structure on outlier suppression remains poorly understood. To fill this gap, we present the first systematic, non-asymptotic analysis of outlier suppression for block Hadamard rotations. Our analysis reveals that outlier suppression is fundamentally limited by the geometry of the input vector. In particular, post-rotation outliers are deterministically minimized when the pre-rotation $\\ell_1$ norm mass is evenly distributed across blocks. Guided by these insights, we introduce MixQuant, a block rotation-aware PTQ framework that redistributes activation mass via permutations prior to rotation. We propose a greedy mass diffusion algorithm to calibrate permutations by equalizing the expected blockwise $\\ell_1$ norms. To avoid adding inference overhead, we identify permutation-equivariant regions in transformer architectures to merge the resulting permutations into model weights before deployment. Experiments show that MixQuant consistently improves accuracy across all block sizes, recovering up to 90% of the full-vector rotation perplexity when quantizing Llama3 1B to INT4 with block size 16, compared to 46% without permutations.",

We show that these representations can be approximated uniformly for a range of policies using a set-based architecture. Our model encodes a set of state-action samples into a latent embedding, from which we decode both the policy and its value functions corresponding to multiple rewards. We use variational generative approach to induce a smooth latent space, and further shape it with contrastive learning so that latent distances align with differences in value functions. This geometry permits gradient-based optimization directly in the latent space. Leveraging this capability, we solve a novel behavior synthesis task, where policies are steered to satisfy previously unseen value function constraints without additional training.",

To elaborate, we formalize recoverability through Expected Recovery Regret (ERR), which quantifies the deviation of a recovery policy from the optimal one under stochastic execution noise, and derive a first-order relationship between ERR and an empirical observable quantity, the Efficiency Score (ES). This yields a falsifiable first-order quantitative law of recovery dynamics in tool-using agents. We empirically validate the law across five tool-use benchmarks spanning controlled perturbations, diagnostic reasoning, and real-world APIs. Across model scales, perturbation regimes, and recovery horizons, predicted regret under the ERR-ES law closely matched observed post-failure regret measured from Monte Carlo rollouts, within delta less than or equal to 0.05. Our results reveal that recoverability is not an artifact of model scale or architecture, but a governed property of interaction dynamics, providing a theoretical foundation for execution-level robustness in language agents.",

While existing methods certify unlearning via statistical indistinguishability from re-trained models, these guarantees do not naturally extend to model outputs when inputs are adversarially perturbed. In particular, slight perturbations of forget samples may still be correctly recognized by the unlearned model - even when a re-trained model fails to do so - revealing a novel privacy risk: information about the forget samples may persist in their local neighborhood. In this work, we formalize this vulnerability as residual knowledge and show that it is inevitable in high-dimensional settings. To mitigate this risk, we propose a fine-tuning strategy, named RURK, that penalizes the model's ability to re-recognize perturbed forget samples. Experiments on vision benchmarks with deep neural networks demonstrate that residual knowledge is prevalent across existing unlearning methods and that our approach effectively prevents residual knowledge.",

Large language models (LLMs) have recently enabled substantial progress in automated veracity assessment, including automated fact-checking and claim verification systems. Typical veracity assessment pipelines break down complex claims into sub-claims, retrieve external evidence, and then apply LLM reasoning to assess veracity. However, existing methods often treat evidence retrieval as a static, isolated step and do not effectively manage or reuse retrieved evidence across claims. In this work, we propose MERMAID, a memory-enhanced multi-agent veracity assessment framework that tightly couples the retrieval and reasoning processes. MERMAID integrates agent-driven search, structured knowledge representations, and a persistent memory module within a Reason-Action style iterative process, enabling dynamic evidence acquisition and cross-claim evidence reuse. By retaining retrieved evidence in an evidence memory, the framework reduces redundant searches and improves verification efficiency and consistency. We evaluate MERMAID on three fact-checking benchmarks and two claim-verification datasets using multiple LLMs, including GPT, LLaMA, and Qwen families. Experimental results show that MERMAID achieves state-of-the-art performance while improving the search efficiency, demonstrating the effectiveness of synergizing retrieval, reasoning, and memory for reliable veracity assessment.",

Language models can also adapt to diverse tasks and learn new structure in context, and recent work has shown that this in-context learning (ICL) can be reflected in representational changes. Here we bring these two lines of research together to explore whether representation straightening occurs \\emph{within} a context during ICL. We measure representational straightening in Gemma 2 models across a diverse set of in-context tasks, and uncover a dichotomy in how LLMs' representations change in context. In continual prediction settings (e.g., natural language, grid world traversal tasks) we observe that increasing context increases the straightness of neural sequence trajectories, which is correlated with improvement in model prediction. Conversely, in structured prediction settings (e.g., few-shot tasks), straightening is inconsistent -- it is only present in phases of the task with explicit structure (e.g., repeating a template), but vanishes elsewhere. These results suggest that ICL is not a monolithic process. Instead, we propose that LLMs function like a Swiss Army knife: depending on task structure, the LLM dynamically selects between strategies, only some of which yield representational straightening.",

        "abstract": "Graphs provide a natural representation of relational structure that arises across diverse domains. Despite this ubiquity, graph structure is typically learned in a modality- and task-isolated manner, where graph representations are constructed within individual task contexts and discarded thereafter. As a result, structural regularities across modalities and tasks are repeatedly reconstructed rather than accumulated at the level of intermediate graph representations. This motivates a representation-learning question: how should graph structure be organized so that it can persist and accumulate across heterogeneous modalities and tasks? We adopt a representation-centric perspective in which graph structure is treated as a structural substrate that persists across learning contexts. To instantiate this perspective, we propose G-Substrate, a graph substrate framework that organizes learning around shared graph structures. G-Substrate comprises two complementary mechanisms: a unified structural schema that ensures compatibility among graph representations across heterogeneous modalities and tasks, and an interleaved role-based training strategy that exposes the same graph structure to multiple functional roles during learning. Experiments across multiple domains, modalities, and tasks show that G-Substrate outperforms task-isolated and naive multi-task learning methods.",

We introduce our method, SP2DPO (Semantic Per-Pair DPO), a generalization that replaces the global temperature with an instance-specific schedule beta_i pre-decided offline from structured semantic-gap annotations (category, magnitude, confidence) produced by teacher language models. We instantiate this procedure on the UltraFeedback preference corpus (59,960 pairs), enabling large-scale construction of an auditable beta_i artifact, and incur zero training-time overhead: the inner-loop optimizer remains standard DPO with beta set per pair. We focus our empirical study on AlpacaEval 2.0, reporting both raw win rate and length-controlled win rate. Across four open-weight, instruction-tuned student backbones (4B-8B), SP2DPO is competitive with a tuned global-beta DPO baseline and improves AlpacaEval 2.0 length-controlled win rate on two of four backbones, while avoiding per-model beta sweeps.

Attribution is computed via integrated gradients that accumulate score contributions along paths from the outlier toward the normal data distribution. Our method satisfies three of the four classic Shapley value axioms - dummy, efficiency, and linearity - as well as an asymmetry axiom derived from the underlying causal structure. Unlike prior work, SIREN operates directly on the score function, enabling tractable and uncertainty-aware root cause attribution in nonlinear, high-dimensional, and heteroscedastic causal models. Extensive experiments on synthetic random graphs and real-world cloud service and supply chain datasets show that SIREN outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both attribution accuracy and computational efficiency.",

While traditional system identification attempts to reconstruct full system matrices (incurring exponential cost in the Hilbert dimension), we propose Quantum Spectral Filtering, a method that shifts the goal to improper dynamic learning. Leveraging the optimal concentration properties of the Slepian basis, we prove that the learnability of such systems is governed strictly by an effective quantum dimension $k^*$, determined by the spectral bandwidth and memory horizon. This result establishes that complex-valued LDSs can be learned with sample and computational complexity independent of the ambient state dimension, provided their spectrum is bounded.",

In this paper, we analyze gradient descent (GD) for training two-layer KANs and derive general bounds that characterize their training dynamics, generalization, and utility under differential privacy (DP). As a concrete instantiation, we specialize our analysis to logistic loss under an NTK-separable assumption, where we show that polylogarithmic network width suffices for GD to achieve an optimization rate of order $1/T$ and a generalization rate of order $1/n$, with $T$ denoting the number of GD iterations and $n$ the sample size. In the private setting, we characterize the noise required for $(\\epsilon,\\delta)$-DP and obtain a utility bound of order $\\sqrt{d}/(n\\epsilon)$ (with $d$ the input dimension), matching the classical lower bound for general convex Lipschitz problems. Our results imply that polylogarithmic width is not only sufficient but also necessary under differential privacy, revealing a qualitative gap between non-private (sufficiency only) and private (necessity also emerges) training regimes. Experiments further illustrate how these theoretical insights can guide practical choices, including network width selection and early stopping.",

        "abstract": "Pooled testing is a common strategy for public health disease screening under limited testing resources, allowing multiple biological samples to be tested together with the resources of a single test, at the cost of reduced individual resolution. While dynamic and adaptive strategies have been extensively studied in the classical pooled testing literature, where the goal is to minimize the number of tests required for full diagnosis of a given population, much of the existing work on welfare-maximizing pooled testing adopts static formulations in which all tests are assigned in advance. In this paper, we study dynamic welfare-maximizing pooled testing strategies in which a limited number of tests are performed sequentially to maximize social welfare, defined as the aggregate utility of individuals who are confirmed to be healthy. We formally define the dynamic problem and study algorithmic approaches for sequential test assignment. Because exact dynamic optimization is computationally infeasible beyond small instances, we evaluate a range of strategies (including exact optimization baselines, greedy heuristics, mixed-integer programming relaxations, and learning-based policies) and empirically characterize their performance and tradeoffs using synthetic experiments. Our results show that dynamic testing can yield substantial welfare improvements over static baselines in low-budget regimes. We find that much of the benefit of dynamic testing is captured by simple greedy policies, which substantially outperform static approaches while remaining computationally efficient. Learning-based methods are included as flexible baselines, but in our experiments they do not reliably improve upon these heuristics. Overall, this work provides a principled computational perspective on dynamic pooled testing and clarifies when dynamic assignment meaningfully improves welfare in public health screening.",

As forecasting is probabilistic, developing and evaluating AI forecasters requires generating large numbers of diverse and difficult questions, and accurately resolving them. Previous efforts to automate this laborious work relied on recurring data sources (e.g., weather, stocks), limiting diversity and utility. In this work, we present a system for generating and resolving high-quality forecasting questions automatically and at scale using LLM-powered web research agents. We use this system to generate 1499 diverse, real-world forecasting questions, and to resolve them several months later. We estimate that our system produces verifiable, unambiguous questions approximately 96% of the time, exceeding the rate of Metaculus, a leading human-curated forecasting platform. We also find that our system resolves questions at approximately 95% accuracy. We verify that forecasting agents powered by more intelligent LLMs perform better on these questions (Brier score of 0.134 for Gemini 3 Pro, 0.149 for GPT-5, and 0.179 for Gemini 2.5 Flash). Finally, we demonstrate how our system can be leveraged to directly improve forecasting, by evaluating a question decomposition strategy on a generated question set, yielding a significant improvement in Brier scores (0.132 vs. 0.141).",

        "abstract": "Masked Diffusion Language Models have recently emerged as a powerful generative paradigm, yet their generalization properties remain understudied compared to their auto-regressive counterparts. In this work, we investigate these properties within the setting of the $k$-parity problem (computing the XOR sum of $k$ relevant bits), where neural networks typically exhibit grokking -- a prolonged plateau of chance-level performance followed by sudden generalization. We theoretically decompose the Masked Diffusion (MD) objective into a Signal regime which drives feature learning, and a Noise regime which serves as an implicit regularizer. By training nanoGPT using MD objective on the $k$-parity problem, we demonstrate that MD objective fundamentally alters the learning landscape, enabling rapid and simultaneous generalization without experiencing grokking. Furthermore, we leverage our theoretical insights to optimize the distribution of the mask probability in the MD objective. Our method significantly improves perplexity for 50M-parameter models and achieves superior results across both pre-training from scratch and supervised fine-tuning. Specifically, we observe performance gains peaking at $8.8\\%$ and $5.8\\%$, respectively, on 8B-parameter models, confirming the scalability and effectiveness of our framework in large-scale masked diffusion language model regimes.",

We discover that agency in human-AI chatrooms is an emergent, shared experience: as participants claimed agency by setting boundaries and providing feedback, and the AI was perceived to steer intentions and drive execution, control shifted and was co-constructed turn-by-turn. We introduce a 3-by-5 framework mapping who (human, AI, hybrid) x agency action (Intention, Execution, Adaptation, Delimitation, Negotiation), modulated by individual and environmental factors.

However, prevailing methods are predominantly task-centric and rely on restrictive assumptions -- such as short-term dependency modeling, static neighborhood semantics, and retrospective time usage. These constraints hinder the discovery of transferable temporal evolution mechanisms. To address this, we propose the Temporal Graph Pattern Machine (TGPM), a foundation framework that shifts the focus toward directly learning generalized evolving patterns. TGPM conceptualizes each interaction as an interaction patch synthesized via temporally-biased random walks, thereby capturing multi-scale structural semantics and long-range dependencies that extend beyond immediate neighborhoods. These patches are processed by a Transformer-based backbone designed to capture global temporal regularities while adapting to context-specific interaction dynamics. To further empower the model, we introduce a suite of self-supervised pre-training tasks -- specifically masked token modeling and next-time prediction -- to explicitly encode the fundamental laws of network evolution. Extensive experiments show that TGPM consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in both transductive and inductive link prediction, demonstrating exceptional cross-domain transferability.",

In this work, a novel perspective for MU is presented upon low-dimensional feature subspaces, which gives rise to the potentials of separating the remaining and forgetting data herein. This separability motivates our LOFT, a method that proceeds unlearning in a LOw-dimensional FeaTure subspace from the pretrained model skithrough principal projections, which are optimized to maximally capture the information of the remaining data and meanwhile diminish that of the forgetting data. In training, LOFT simply optimizes a small-size projection matrix flexibly plugged into the pretrained model, and only requires one-shot feature fetching from the pretrained backbone instead of repetitively accessing the raw data. Hence, LOFT mitigates two critical issues in mainstream MU methods, i.e., the privacy leakage risk from massive data reload and the inefficiency of updates to the entire pretrained model. Extensive experiments validate the significantly lower computational overhead and superior unlearning performance of LOFT across diverse models, datasets, tasks, and applications.

With the scaling of technology nodes, in floorplanning stage especially 3D scenarios with multiple stacked layers, it has become increasingly challenging to adhere to complex hardware design rules. Current methods are only capable of handling specific and limited design rules, while violations of other rules require manual and meticulous adjustment. This leads to labor-intensive and time-consuming post-processing for expert engineers. In this paper, we propose an all-in-one deep reinforcement learning-based approach to tackle these challenges, and design novel representations for real-world IC design rules that have not been addressed by previous approaches. Specifically, the processing of various hardware design rules is unified into a single framework with three key components: 1) novel matrix representations to model the design rules, 2) constraints on the action space to filter out invalid actions that cause rule violations, and 3) quantitative analysis of constraint satisfaction as reward signals. Experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and validity of our approach. Furthermore, transferability is well demonstrated on unseen circuits. Our framework is extensible to accommodate new design rules, thus providing flexibility to address emerging challenges in future chip design. Code will be available at: this https URL",

Specifically, FraudShield constructs and refines a fraud tactic-keyword knowledge graph to capture high-confidence associations between suspicious text and fraud techniques. The structured knowledge graph augments the original input by highlighting keywords and providing supporting evidence, guiding the LLM toward more secure responses. Extensive experiments show that FraudShield consistently outperforms state-of-the-art defenses across four mainstream LLMs and five representative fraud types, while also offering interpretable clues for the model's generations.",

This study evaluates the impact of Day of AI Australia's workshop-based intervention designed to improve AI literacy and conceptual understanding among Australian secondary students (Years 7-10). Using a mixed-methods approach with pre- and post-intervention surveys (N=205 pre; N=163 post), we analyse changes in students' ability to identify AI in everyday tools, their understanding of AI ethics, training, and safety, and their interest in STEM-related careers. Baseline data revealed notable synthetic media risks: 82.4% of students reported having seen deepfakes, 18.5% reported sharing them, and 7.3% reported creating them. Results show higher self-reported AI knowledge and confidence after the intervention, alongside improved recognition of AI in widely used platforms such as Netflix, Spotify, and TikTok. This pattern suggests a shift from seeing these tools as merely \"algorithm-based\" to recognising them as AI-driven systems. Students also reported increased interest in STEM careers post-workshop; however, effect sizes were small, indicating that sustained approaches beyond one-off workshops may be needed to influence longer-term aspirations. Overall, the findings support scalable AI literacy programs that pair foundational AI concepts with an explicit emphasis on synthetic media safety.",

A critical design choice in such architectures is the goal representation-the compressed encoding of goals that serves as the interface between these levels. Existing approaches commonly derive goal representations while learning value functions, implicitly assuming that preserving information sufficient for value estimation is adequate for optimal control. We show that this assumption can fail, even when the value estimation is exact, as such representations may collapse goal states that need to be differentiated for action learning. To address this, we introduce an information-theoretic framework that defines action sufficiency, a condition on goal representations necessary for optimal action selection. We prove that value sufficiency does not imply action sufficiency and empirically verify that the latter is more strongly associated with control success in a discrete environment. We further demonstrate that standard log-loss training of low-level policies naturally induces action-sufficient representations. Our experimental results a popular benchmark demonstrate that our actor-derived representations consistently outperform representations learned via value estimation.",

In this paper, we study a novel lifelong learning paradigm for neural VRP solvers under continually drifting tasks over learning time steps, where sufficient training for any given task at any time is not available. We propose Dual Replay with Experience Enhancement (DREE), a general framework to improve learning efficiency and mitigate catastrophic forgetting under such drift.

While recent work reveals the discrepancy between LLMs and humans in skill compositions, the learning dynamics of skill compositions and the underlying cause of non-human behavior remain elusive. In this study, we investigate the mechanism of learning dynamics by training transformers on synthetic arithmetic tasks. Through extensive ablations and fine-grained diagnostic metrics, we discover that transformers do not reliably build skill compositions according to human-like sequential rules. Instead, they often acquire skills in reverse order or in parallel, which leads to unexpected mixing errors especially under distribution shifts--a phenomenon we refer to as shattered compositionality. To explain these behaviors, we provide evidence that correlational matching to the training data, rather than causal or procedural composition, shapes learning dynamics. We further show that shattered compositionality persists in modern LLMs and is not mitigated by pure model scaling or scratchpad-based reasoning. Our results reveal a fundamental mismatch between a model's learning behavior and desired skill compositions, with implications for reasoning reliability, out-of-distribution robustness, and alignment.",

Predicting this disease early is challenging because it depends on traditional diagnostic methods that face issues of subjectivity, which commonly delay diagnosis. Several objective analyses are currently in practice to help overcome the challenges of subjectivity; however, a proper explanation of these analyses is still lacking. While machine learning (ML) has demonstrated potential in supporting PD diagnosis, existing approaches often rely on subjective reports only and lack interpretability for individualized risk estimation. This study proposes SCOPE-PD, an explainable AI-based prediction framework, by integrating subjective and objective assessments to provide personalized health decisions. Subjective and objective clinical assessment data are collected from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) study to construct a multimodal prediction framework. Several ML techniques are applied to these data, and the best ML model is selected to interpret the results. Model interpretability is examined using SHAP-based analysis. The Random Forest algorithm achieves the highest accuracy of 98.66 percent using combined features from both subjective and objective test data. Tremor, bradykinesia, and facial expression are identified as the top three contributing features from the MDS-UPDRS test in the prediction of PD.",

The general idea of rationale extraction (RE) is to provide an interpretable-by-design framework for DNNs via a select-predict architecture where two neural networks learn jointly to perform feature selection and prediction, respectively. Given only the remote supervision from the final task prediction, the process of learning to select subsets of features (or \\emph{rationales}) requires searching in the space of all possible feature combinations, which is computationally challenging and even harder when the base neural networks are not sufficiently capable. To improve the predictive performance of RE models that are based on less capable or smaller neural networks (i.e., the students), we propose \\textbf{REKD} (\\textbf{R}ationale \\textbf{E}xtraction with \\textbf{K}nowledge \\textbf{D}istillation) where a student RE model learns from the rationales and predictions of a teacher (i.e., a \\emph{rationalist}) in addition to the student's own RE optimization. This structural adjustment to RE aligns well with how humans could learn effectively from interpretable and verifiable knowledge. Because of the neural-model agnostic nature of the method, any black-box neural network could be integrated as a backbone model. To demonstrate the viability of REKD, we conduct experiments with multiple variants of BERT and vision transformer (ViT) models. Our experiments across language and vision classification datasets (i.e., IMDB movie reviews, CIFAR 10 and CIFAR 100) show that REKD significantly improves the predictive performance of the student RE models.",

        "abstract": "The reinforcement fine-tuning area is undergoing an explosion papers largely on optimizing design choices. Though performance gains are often claimed, inconsistent conclusions also arise from time to time, making the progress illusive. Reflecting on this illusion, we still lack principled answers to two fundamental questions: 1) what is the role of each design choice? 2) which ones are critical? This paper aims to shed light on them. The underlying challenge is that design choices are entangled together, making their contribution to learning and generalization difficult to attribute. To address this challenge, we first construct a minimalist baseline for disentangling factors: one rollout per query in each round, the outcome reward serving as the training signal without any advantage trick, and a batch size of thirty-two. This baseline connects to batched contextual bandit learning, which facilitates experimental analysis. Centering around this baseline, we design an experiment pipeline, examining the marginal gains of factors like advantage, number of rollouts, etc. Experiments on three base models and two datasets, not only reveal new understanding on the role of various design choices on learning and generalization dynamics, but also identify critical ones that deserve more effort.",

        "abstract": "Real-time path planning in constrained environments remains a fundamental challenge for autonomous systems. Traditional classical planners, while effective under perfect perception assumptions, are often sensitive to real-world perception constraints and rely on online search procedures that incur high computational costs. In complex surroundings, this renders real-time deployment prohibitive. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework for real-time path planning in parking scenarios. In particular, we focus on challenging scenes with tight spaces that require a high number of reversal maneuvers and adjustments. Unlike classical planners, our solution does not require ideal and structured perception, and in principle, could avoid the need for additional modules such as localization and tracking, resulting in a simpler and more practical implementation. Also, at test time, the policy generates actions through a single forward pass at each step, which is lightweight enough for real-time deployment. The task is formulated as a sequential decision-making problem grounded in a bicycle model dynamics, enabling the agent to directly learn navigation policies that respect vehicle kinematics and environmental constraints in the closed-loop setting. A new benchmark is developed to support both training and evaluation, capturing diverse and challenging scenarios. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art success rates and efficiency, surpassing classical planner baselines by +96% in success rate and +52% in efficiency. Furthermore, we release our benchmark as an open-source resource for the community to foster future research in autonomous systems.

However, there are few studies investigating the specific traits related to the powerful generation capacity of LLMs. This paper aims to delve into the generation characteristics exhibited by LLMs. Through our investigation, we have discovered that language models tend to capture target-side keywords at the beginning of the generation process. We name this phenomenon the Holographic Characteristic of language models. For the purpose of exploring this characteristic and further improving the inference efficiency of language models, we propose a plugin called HOLO, which leverages the Holographic Characteristic to extract target-side keywords from language models within a limited number of generation steps and complements the sentence with a parallel lexically constrained text generation method. To verify the effectiveness of HOLO, we conduct massive experiments on language models of varying architectures and scales in the short-text generation scenario. The results demonstrate that HOLO achieves comparable performance to the baselines in terms of both automatic and human-like evaluation metrics and highlight the potential of the Holographic Characteristic.",

However, it is difficult to disentangle which evaluation biases are explained by narcissism versus general experimental confounds, distorting measurements of self-preference bias. We discover a core methodological confound which could reduce measurement error by 89.6%. Specifically, LLM evaluators may deliver self-preferring verdicts when the judge responds to queries which they completed incorrectly themselves; this would be true regardless of whether one of their responses is their own. To decouple self-preference signals from noisy outputs on hard problems, we introduce an Evaluator Quality Baseline, which compares the probability that a judge incorrectly votes for itself against the probability that it votes for an incorrect response from another model. Evaluating this simple baseline on 37,448 queries, only 51% of initial findings retain statistical significance. Finally, we turn towards characterizing the entropy of \"easy\" versus \"hard\" evaluation votes from LLM judges. Our corrective baseline enables future research on self-preference by eliminating noisy data from potential solutions. More widely, this work contributes to the growing body of work on cataloging and isolating judge-bias effects.",

Existing federated methods frequently struggle with this data heterogeneity, typically entangling globally shared patterns with client-specific local dynamics within a single representation. In this work, we postulate that this heterogeneity stems from the entanglement of two distinct generative sources: client-specific localized dynamics and cross-client global spatial-temporal patterns. Motivated by this perspective, we introduce FedDis, a novel framework that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to leverage causal disentanglement for federated spatial-temporal prediction. Architecturally, FedDis comprises a dual-branch design wherein a Personalized Bank learns to capture client-specific factors, while a Global Pattern Bank distills common knowledge. This separation enables robust cross-client knowledge transfer while preserving high adaptability to unique local environments. Crucially, a mutual information minimization objective is employed to enforce informational orthogonality between the two branches, thereby ensuring effective disentanglement. Comprehensive experiments conducted on four real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that FedDis consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, promising efficiency, and superior expandability.",

A critical design choice is the placement of normalization layers, leading to a fundamental trade-off: the ``PreNorm'' architecture ensures training stability at the cost of potential performance degradation in deep models, while the ``PostNorm'' architecture offers strong performance but suffers from severe training instability. In this work, we propose SpanNorm, a novel technique designed to resolve this dilemma by integrating the strengths of both paradigms. Structurally, SpanNorm establishes a clean residual connection that spans the entire transformer block to stabilize signal propagation, while employing a PostNorm-style computation that normalizes the aggregated output to enhance model performance. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that SpanNorm, combined with a principled scaling strategy, maintains bounded signal variance throughout the network, preventing the gradient issues that plague PostNorm models, and also alleviating the representation collapse of PreNorm. Empirically, SpanNorm consistently outperforms standard normalization schemes in both dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) scenarios, paving the way for more powerful and stable Transformer architectures.",

        "abstract": "Group-relative policy optimization methods train language models by generating multiple rollouts per prompt and normalizing rewards with a shared mean reward baseline. In resource-constrained settings where the rollout budget is small, accuracy often degrades. We find that noise in the shared baseline induces advantage sign flips, where some rollouts receive an incorrect advantage sign, and the update direction is reversed. To address this, we propose Median-Centered Group Relative Policy Optimization (MC-GRPO), a simple and effective solution for small-rollout training. Our main idea is to replace the mean baseline with a median baseline: the median is far less sensitive to outlier rewards than the mean, mitigating the sign flips under small rollout size (G). We generate one additional rollout for median reference (G+1), and compute advantages by using the group median. With an odd-sized group, exactly one completion is the median and receives zero advantage, we exclude this pivot rollout from backpropagation so the number of gradient-contributing samples per prompt remains G, preserving the core update cost of standard G-rollout training. Across various GRPO-family methods and a wide range of models and scales, this median-centered training consistently improves stability and final accuracy in the low-rollout regime, reducing the gap between G=2 and G=8 to within 1%.

In this work, we investigate whether smaller models can serve as efficient evaluators by leveraging internal representations instead of surface generation. We uncover a consistent empirical pattern: small LMs, despite with weak generative ability, encode rich evaluative signals in their hidden states. This motivates us to propose the Semantic Capacity Asymmetry Hypothesis: evaluation requires significantly less semantic capacity than generation and can be grounded in intermediate representations, suggesting that evaluation does not necessarily need to rely on large-scale generative models but can instead leverage latent features from smaller ones. Our findings motivate a paradigm shift from LLM-as-a-Judge to Representation-as-a-Judge, a decoding-free evaluation strategy that probes internal model structure rather than relying on prompted output. We instantiate this paradigm through INSPECTOR, a probing-based framework that predicts aspect-level evaluation scores from small model representations. Experiments on reasoning benchmarks (GSM8K, MATH, GPQA) show that INSPECTOR substantially outperforms prompting-based small LMs and closely approximates full LLM judges, while offering a more efficient, reliable, and interpretable alternative for scalable evaluation.",

Retraining a federated model from scratch is prohibitively expensive, motivating federated unlearning (FU). However, existing FU methods suffer from high unlearning overhead, utility degradation caused by entangled knowledge, and unintended relearning during post-unlearning recovery. In this paper, we propose FedCARE, a unified and low overhead FU framework that enables conflict-aware unlearning and relearning-resistant recovery. FedCARE leverages gradient ascent for efficient forgetting when target data are locally available and employs data free model inversion to construct class level proxies of shared knowledge. Based on these insights, FedCARE integrates a pseudo-sample generator, conflict-aware projected gradient ascent for utility preserving unlearning, and a recovery strategy that suppresses rollback toward the pre-unlearning model. FedCARE supports client, instance, and class level unlearning with modest overhead. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and model architectures under both IID and non-IID settings show that FedCARE achieves effective forgetting, improved utility retention, and reduced relearning risk compared to state of the art FU baselines.",

        "abstract": "The high-level concepts that a neural network uses to perform computation need not be aligned to individual neurons (Smolensky, 1986). Language model interpretability research has thus turned to techniques such as \\textit{sparse autoencoders} (SAEs) to decompose the neuron basis into more interpretable units of model computation, for tasks such as \\textit{circuit tracing}. However, not all neuron-based representations are uninterpretable. For the first time, we empirically show that \\textbf{MLP neurons are as sparse a feature basis as SAEs}. We use this finding to develop an end-to-end pipeline for circuit tracing on the MLP neuron basis, which locates causal circuitry on a variety of tasks using gradient-based attribution. On a standard subject-verb agreement benchmark (Marks et al., 2025), a circuit of $\\approx 10^2$ MLP neurons is enough to control model behaviour. On the multi-hop city $\\to$ state $\\to$ capital task from Lindsey et al., 2025, we find a circuit in which small sets of neurons encode specific latent reasoning steps (e.g.~`map city to its state'), and can be steered to change the model's output. This work thus advances automated interpretability of language models without additional training costs.",

In this work, we propose LGM-CL, a local-global multimodal contrastive learning framework that jointly models molecular graphs and textual representations derived from SMILES and chemistry-aware augmented texts. Local functional group information and global molecular topology are captured using AttentiveFP and Graph Transformer encoders, respectively, and aligned through self-supervised contrastive learning. In addition, chemically enriched textual descriptions are contrasted with original SMILES to incorporate physicochemical semantics in a task-agnostic manner. During fine-tuning, molecular fingerprints are further integrated via Dual Cross-attention multimodal fusion. Extensive experiments on MoleculeNet benchmarks demonstrate that LGM-CL achieves consistent and competitive performance across both classification and regression tasks, validating the effectiveness of unified local-global and multimodal representation learning.",

        "abstract": "Test-Time Training offers a promising way to improve the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) by adapting the model using only the test questions. However, existing methods struggle with difficult reasoning problems for two reasons: raw test questions are often too difficult to yield high-quality pseudo-labels, and the limited size of test sets makes continuous online updates prone to instability. To address these limitations, we propose TTCS, a co-evolving test-time training framework. Specifically, TTCS initializes two policies from the same pretrained model: a question synthesizer and a reasoning solver. These policies evolve through iterative optimization: the synthesizer generates progressively challenging question variants conditioned on the test questions, creating a structured curriculum tailored to the solver's current capability, while the solver updates itself using self-consistency rewards computed from multiple sampled responses on both original test and synthetic questions. Crucially, the solver's feedback guides the synthesizer to generate questions aligned with the model's current capability, and the generated question variants in turn stabilize the solver's test-time training. Experiments show that TTCS consistently strengthens the reasoning ability on challenging mathematical benchmarks and transfers to general-domain tasks across different LLM backbones, highlighting a scalable path towards dynamically constructing test-time curricula for self-evolving.

In this paper, we show that Diffusion-LMs, like diffusion models in image generation, exhibit a temporal division of labor: early denoising steps largely determine the global semantic structure, while later steps focus on local lexical refinement. Building on this insight, we propose Time-Annealed Perturbation Sampling (TAPS), a training-free inference strategy that encourages semantic branching early in the diffusion process while progressively reducing perturbations to preserve fluency and instruction adherence. TAPS is compatible with both non-autoregressive and semi-autoregressive Diffusion backbones, demonstrated on LLaDA and TraDo in our paper, and consistently improves output diversity across creative writing and reasoning benchmarks without compromising generation quality.",

Mainstream solutions such as domain adaptation and meta-learning still rely on large amounts of historical degradation data from equipment that is identical or similar to the target, which imposes significant limitations in practical applications. This study investigates PEFT-MuTS, a Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning framework for few-shot RUL prediction, built on cross-domain pre-trained time-series representation models. Contrary to the widely held view that knowledge transfer in RUL prediction can only occur within similar devices, we demonstrate that substantial benefits can be achieved through pre-training process with large-scale cross-domain time series datasets. A independent feature tuning network and a meta-variable-based low rank multivariate fusion mechanism are developed to enable the pre-trained univariate time-series representation backbone model to fully exploit the multivariate relationships in degradation data for downstream RUL prediction task. Additionally, we introduce a zero-initialized regressor that stabilizes the fine-tuning process under few-shot conditions. Experiments on aero-engine and industrial bearing datasets demonstrate that our method can achieve effective RUL prediction even when less than 1\\% of samples of target equipment are used. Meanwhile, it substantially outperforms conventional supervised and few-shot approaches while markedly reducing the data required to achieve high predictive accuracy.

        "abstract": "Gliomas are placing an increasingly clinical burden on Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). In the region, the median survival for patients remains under two years, and access to diagnostic imaging is extremely limited. These constraints highlight an urgent need for automated tools that can extract the maximum possible information from each available scan, tools that are specifically trained on local data, rather than adapted from high-income settings where conditions are vastly different. We utilize the Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) Africa 2025 Challenge dataset, an expert annotated collection of glioma MRIs. Our objectives are: (i) establish a strong baseline with nnUNet on this dataset, and (ii) explore whether the celebrated \"grokking\" phenomenon an abrupt, late training jump from memorization to superior generalization can be triggered to push performance without extra labels. We evaluate two training regimes. The first is a fast, budget-conscious approach that limits optimization to just a few epochs, reflecting the constrained GPU resources typically available in African institutions. Despite this limitation, nnUNet achieves strong Dice scores: 92.3% for whole tumor (WH), 86.6% for tumor core (TC), and 86.3% for enhancing tumor (ET). The second regime extends training well beyond the point of convergence, aiming to trigger a grokking-driven performance leap. With this approach, we were able to achieve grokking and enhanced our results to higher Dice scores: 92.2% for whole tumor (WH), 90.1% for tumor core (TC), and 90.2% for enhancing tumor (ET).",

However, current state-of-the-art systems still struggle with \"surface-level\" critiques: they excel at summarizing content but often fail to accurately assess novelty and significance or identify deep methodological flaws because they evaluate papers in a vacuum, lacking the external context a human expert possesses. In this paper, we introduce ScholarPeer, a search-enabled multi-agent framework designed to emulate the cognitive processes of a senior researcher. ScholarPeer employs a dual-stream process of context acquisition and active verification. It dynamically constructs a domain narrative using a historian agent, identifies missing comparisons via a baseline scout, and verifies claims through a multi-aspect Q&A engine, grounding the critique in live web-scale literature. We evaluate ScholarPeer on DeepReview-13K and the results demonstrate that ScholarPeer achieves significant win-rates against state-of-the-art approaches in side-by-side evaluations and reduces the gap to human-level diversity.",

While most methods score individual examples, practitioners often need group-level answers (e.g., artistic styles or object classes). Group-wise attribution is counterfactual: how would a model's behavior on a generated sample change if a group were absent from training? A natural realization of this counterfactual is Leave-One-Group-Out (LOGO) retraining, which retrains the model with each group removed; however, it becomes computationally prohibitive as the number of groups grows. We propose GUDA (Group Unlearning-based Data Attribution) for diffusion models, which approximates each counterfactual model by applying machine unlearning to a shared full-data model instead of training from scratch. GUDA quantifies group influence using differences in a likelihood-based scoring rule (ELBO) between the full model and each unlearned counterfactual. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and artistic style attribution with Stable Diffusion show that GUDA identifies primary contributing groups more reliably than semantic similarity, gradient-based attribution, and instance-level unlearning approaches, while achieving x100 speedup on CIFAR-10 over LOGO retraining.",

We present a mixed-methods study of explanation design strategies in AI-driven security dashboards. Through a taxonomy of explanation styles and a controlled user study with security practitioners, we compare natural language rationales, confidence visualizations, counterfactual explanations, and hybrid approaches. Our findings show that explanation style significantly affects user trust calibration, decision accuracy, and cognitive load. We contribute (1) empirical evidence on the usability of explanation interfaces for security copilots, (2) design guidelines for integrating explainability into enterprise UIs, and (3) a framework for aligning explanation strategies with analyst needs in security operations centers (SOCs).

We argue this approach is suboptimal for text-graphs: it creates a conceptually disjointed interaction paradigm. By segregating structural encoding from semantic processing, these systems must perform a complex implicit alignment between abstract graph tokens and concrete textual elements. Challenging the necessity of external encoders, we propose NAG (Native Architecture for Graphs), a unified framework that internalizes graph processing within the LM's native manifold. Instead of bridging disparate embedding spaces, NAG repurposes the self-attention mechanism to enforce topological dependencies and recalibrates positional IDs to ensure structural equivalence. This allows the model to harness its intrinsic linguistic capability to simultaneously comprehend node and edge content alongside structural topology. We introduce two efficient implementations: NAG-Zero for absolute preservation of the base model's linguistic capabilities, and NAG-LoRA for enhanced structural adaptation. Experiments across diverse graph tasks validate that NAG achieves robust graph comprehension without the overhead of external encoders, offering a simpler, more coherent paradigm for text-graph modeling.",

Theoretically, we propose Human-AI Collaboration Efficacy as the primary optimization target for engineering organizations, supplanting individual productivity metrics. Our Total Factor Productivity analysis identifies an AI Distortion Effect that diminishes returns to labor scale while amplifying technological leverage. We conclude with managerial strategies for organizational redesign, including the reactivation of idle cognitive bandwidth in senior engineers and the suppression of blind scale expansion.",

However, current models still exhibit substantial limitations in out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization compared with humans. We investigate this gap through periodicity, one of the basic OOD scenarios. Periodicity captures invariance amid variation. Periodicity generalization represents a model's ability to extract periodic patterns from training data and generalize to OOD scenarios. We introduce a unified interpretation of periodicity from the perspective of abstract algebra and reasoning, including both single and composite periodicity, to explain why Transformers struggle to generalize periodicity. Then we construct Coper about composite periodicity, a controllable generative benchmark with two OOD settings, Hollow and Extrapolation. Experiments reveal that periodicity generalization in Transformers is limited, where models can memorize periodic data during training, but cannot generalize to unseen composite periodicity. We release the source code to support future research.",

Consequently, preventing unauthorized appropriation of open-source LLMs and protecting developers' intellectual property rights have become critical challenges. In this work, we propose the Functional Network Fingerprint (FNF), a training-free, sample-efficient method for detecting whether a suspect LLM is derived from a victim model, based on the consistency between their functional network activity. We demonstrate that models that share a common origin, even with differences in scale or architecture, exhibit highly consistent patterns of neuronal activity within their functional networks across diverse input samples. In contrast, models trained independently on distinct data or with different objectives fail to preserve such activity alignment. Unlike conventional approaches, our method requires only a few samples for verification, preserves model utility, and remains robust to common model modifications (such as fine-tuning, pruning, and parameter permutation), as well as to comparisons across diverse architectures and dimensionalities. FNF thus provides model owners and third parties with a simple, non-invasive, and effective tool for protecting LLM intellectual property. The code is available at this https URL.",

        "abstract": "IR-drop is a critical power integrity challenge in modern VLSI designs that can cause timing degradation, reliability issues, and functional failures if not detected early in the design flow. Conventional IR-drop analysis relies on physics-based signoff tools, which provide high accuracy but incur significant computational cost and require near-final layout information, making them unsuitable for rapid early-stage design exploration. In this work, we propose a deep learning-based surrogate modeling approach for early-stage IR-drop estimation using a CNN. The task is formulated as a dense pixel-wise regression problem, where spatial physical layout features are mapped directly to IR-drop heatmaps. A U-Net-based encoder-decoder architecture with skip connections is employed to effectively capture both local and global spatial dependencies within the layout. The model is trained on a physics-inspired synthetic dataset generated by us, which incorporates key physical factors including power grid structure, cell density distribution, and switching activity. Model performance is evaluated using standard regression metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR). Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can accurately predict IR-drop distributions with millisecond-level inference time, enabling fast pre-signoff screening and iterative design optimization. The proposed framework is intended as a complementary early-stage analysis tool, providing designers with rapid IR-drop insight prior to expensive signoff analysis.

In this work, we propose to utilize the common-sense reasoning abilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to provide promptable representations, effectively separating controllable changes from the noise in unsupervised way. We use these representations as targets during LAM training and benchmark a wide variety of popular VLMs, revealing substantial variation in the quality of promptable representations as well as their robustness to different prompts and hyperparameters. Interestingly, we find that more recent VLMs may perform worse than older ones.

In this work, we demonstrate that element-wise quantization can be made as efficient as block-wise scaling while providing strictly superior expressive power by modeling the scaling manifold as continuous low-rank matrices ($S = BA$). We propose Low-Rank Decomposed Scaling (LoRDS), a unified framework that rethinks quantization granularity through this low-rank decomposition. By \"breaking the blocks\" of spatial constraints, LoRDS establishes a seamless efficiency lifecycle: it provides high-fidelity PTQ initialization refined via iterative optimization, enables joint QAT of weights and scaling factors, and facilitates high-rank multiplicative PEFT adaptation. Unlike additive PEFT approaches such as QLoRA, LoRDS enables high-rank weight updates within a low-rank budget while incurring no additional inference overhead. Supported by highly optimized Triton kernels, LoRDS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across various model families in both quantization and downstream fine-tuning tasks. Notably, on Llama3-8B, our method achieves up to a 27.0% accuracy improvement at 3 bits over NormalFloat quantization and delivers a 1.5x inference speedup on NVIDIA RTX 4090 while enhancing PEFT performance by 9.6% on downstream tasks over 4bit QLoRA, offering a robust and integrated solution for unified compression and adaptation of LLMs.",

LLM-based search discovers exploits dynamically without pre-existing vulnerability graphs, while white-box access enables validating exploits in isolation before committing to attack paths. Evaluation at CIDeX 2025, a large-scale exercise spanning 46 IT hosts, showed that AEGIS-generated paths are comparable to human-authored scenarios across four dimensions of training experience (perceived learning, engagement, believability, challenge).

Here we present GeoOpt-Net, a multi-branch SE(3)-equivariant geometry refinement network that predicts DFT-quality structures at the B3LYP/TZVP level of theory in a single forward pass starting from inexpensive initial conformers generated at a low-cost force-field level. GeoOpt-Net is trained using a two-stage strategy in which a broadly pretrained geometric representation is subsequently fine-tuned to approach B3LYP/TZVP-level accuracy, with theory- and basis-set-aware calibration enabled by a fidelity-aware feature modulation (FAFM) mechanism. Benchmarking against representative approaches spanning classical conformer generation (RDKit), semiempirical quantum methods (xTB), data-driven geometry refinement pipelines (Auto3D), and machine-learning interatomic potentials (UMA) on external drug-like molecules demonstrates that GeoOpt-Net achieves sub-milli-Å all-atom RMSD with near-zero B3LYP/TZVP single-point energy deviations, indicating DFT-ready geometries that closely reproduce both structural and energetic references. Beyond geometric metrics, GeoOpt-Net generates initial guesses intrinsically compatible with DFT convergence criteria, yielding nonzero ``All-YES'' convergence rates (65.0\\% under loose and 33.4\\% under default thresholds), and substantially reducing re-optimization steps and wall-clock time. GeoOpt-Net further exhibits smooth and predictable energy scaling with molecular complexity while preserving key electronic observables such as dipole moments. Collectively, these results establish GeoOpt-Net as a scalable, physically consistent geometry refinement framework that enables efficient acceleration of DFT-based quantum-chemical workflows.",

        "abstract": "Compressing long chains of thought (CoT) into compact latent tokens is crucial for efficient reasoning with large language models (LLMs). Recent studies employ autoencoders to achieve this by reconstructing textual CoT from latent tokens, thus encoding CoT semantics. However, treating textual CoT as the reconstruction target forces latent tokens to preserve surface-level linguistic features (e.g., word choice and syntax), introducing a strong linguistic inductive bias that prioritizes linguistic form over reasoning structure and limits logical abstraction. Thus, we propose ImgCoT that replaces the reconstruction target from textual CoT to the visual CoT obtained by rendering CoT into images. This substitutes linguistic bias with spatial inductive bias, i.e., a tendency to model spatial layouts of the reasoning steps in visual CoT, enabling latent tokens to better capture global reasoning structure. Moreover, although visual latent tokens encode abstract reasoning structure, they may blur reasoning details. We thus propose a loose ImgCoT, a hybrid reasoning that augments visual latent tokens with a few key textual reasoning steps, selected based on low token log-likelihood. This design allows LLMs to retain both global reasoning structure and fine-grained reasoning details with fewer tokens than the complete CoT. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of the two versions of ImgCoT.",

        "abstract": "Causal inference from observational data provides strong evidence for the best action in decision-making without performing expensive randomized trials. The effect of an action is usually not identifiable under unobserved confounding, even with an infinite amount of data. Recent work uses neural networks to obtain practical bounds to such causal effects, which is often an intractable problem. However, these approaches may overfit to the dataset and be overconfident in their causal effect estimates. Moreover, there is currently no systematic approach to disentangle how much of the width of causal effect bounds is due to fundamental non-identifiability versus how much is due to finite-sample limitations. We propose a novel framework to address this problem by considering a confidence set around the empirical observational distribution and obtaining the intersection of causal effect bounds for all distributions in this confidence set. This allows us to distinguish the part of the interval that can be reduced by collecting more samples, which we call sample uncertainty, from the part that can only be reduced by observing more variables, such as latent confounders or instrumental variables, but not with more data, which we call non-ID uncertainty. The upper and lower bounds to this intersection are obtained by solving min-max and max-min problems with neural causal models by searching over all distributions that the dataset might have been sampled from, and all SCMs that entail the corresponding distribution. We demonstrate via extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets that our algorithm can determine when collecting more samples will not help determine the best action. This can guide practitioners to collect more variables or lean towards a randomized study for best action identification.",

However, existing research in this domain faces two significant limitations. First, most methods are confined to single-task prediction, failing to capture the interconnected, multi-faceted nature of urban environments where numerous indicators are deeply correlated. Second, the field lacks a standardized experimental benchmark, which severely impedes fair comparison and reproducible progress. To address these challenges, we first establish a comprehensive benchmark for multi-task urban region profiling, featuring multi-modal features and a diverse set of strong baselines to ensure a fair and rigorous evaluation environment. Concurrently, we propose UrbanMoE, the first sparse multi-modal, multi-expert framework specifically architected to solve the multi-task challenge. Leveraging a sparse Mixture-of-Experts architecture, it dynamically routes multi-modal features to specialized sub-networks, enabling the simultaneous prediction of diverse urban indicators. We conduct extensive experiments on three real-world datasets within our benchmark, where UrbanMoE consistently demonstrates superior performance over all baselines. Further in-depth analysis validates the efficacy and efficiency of our approach, setting a new state-of-the-art and providing the community with a valuable tool for future research in urban analytics",

Despite growing interest, the practical effectiveness of adapting instruction-tuned LLMs to symbolic music remains insufficiently characterized. We present a controlled comparative study of finetuning strategies for ABC-based generation and understanding, comparing an off-the-shelf instruction-tuned backbone to domain-adapted variants and a music-specialized LLM baseline. Across multiple symbolic music corpora and evaluation signals, we provide some insights into adaptation choices for symbolic music applications. We highlight the domain adaptation vs.~preserving prior information tradeoff as well as the distinct behaviour of metrics used to measure the domain adaptation for symbolic music.",

This paper proposes some expanded principles for trust in AI that can be incorporated into common development methods and frame trust as a dynamic, temporal relationship, which involves transparency and mutual respect. We draw on relational ethics and, in particular, African communitarian philosophies, to foreground the nuances of inclusive, participatory processes and long-term relationships with communities. Involving communities throughout the AI lifecycle can foster meaningful relationships with AI design and development teams that incrementally build trust and promote more equitable and context-sensitive AI systems.

While recent end-to-end methods can learn meaningful boundaries from the language-modeling objective alone, it remains difficult to quantitatively assess and systematically steer where compute is spent. We introduce a router-agnostic metric of boundary quality, boundary enrichment B, which measures how strongly chunk starts concentrate on positions with high next-byte surprisal. Guided by this metric, we propose Sombrero, which steers boundary placement toward predictive difficulty via a confidence-alignment boundary loss and stabilizes boundary learning by applying confidence-weighted smoothing at the input level rather than on realized chunks. On 1B scale, across UTF-8 corpora covering English and German text as well as code and mathematical content, Sombrero improves the accuracy-efficiency trade-off and yields boundaries that more consistently align compute with hard-to-predict positions.",

We formalize payload recoverability via classifier accuracy and show previous schemes achieve 100\\% recoverability. In response, we introduce low-recoverability steganography, replacing arbitrary mappings with embedding-space-derived ones. For Llama-8B (LoRA) and Ministral-8B (LoRA) trained on TrojanStego prompts, exact secret recovery rises from 17$\\rightarrow$30\\% (+78\\%) and 24$\\rightarrow$43\\% (+80\\%) respectively, while on Llama-70B (LoRA) trained on Wiki prompts, it climbs from 9$\\rightarrow$19\\% (+123\\%), all while reducing payload recoverability. We then discuss detection. We argue that detecting fine-tuning-based steganographic attacks requires approaches beyond traditional steganalysis. Standard approaches measure distributional shift, which is an expected side-effect of fine-tuning. Instead, we propose a mechanistic interpretability approach: linear probes trained on later-layer activations detect the secret with up to 33\\% higher accuracy in fine-tuned models compared to base models, even for low-recoverability schemes. This suggests that malicious fine-tuning leaves actionable internal signatures amenable to interpretability-based defenses.",

        "abstract": "Large-scale Electronic Health Record (EHR) databases have become indispensable in supporting clinical decision-making through data-driven treatment recommendations. However, existing medication recommender methods often struggle with a user (i.e., patient) cold-start problem, where recommendations for new patients are usually unreliable due to the lack of sufficient prescription history for patient profiling. While prior studies have utilized medical knowledge graphs to connect medication concepts through pharmacological or chemical relationships, these methods primarily focus on mitigating the item cold-start issue and fall short in providing personalized recommendations that adapt to individual patient characteristics. Meta-learning has shown promise in handling new users with sparse interactions in recommender systems. However, its application to EHRs remains underexplored due to the unique sequential structure of EHR data. To tackle these challenges, we propose MetaDrug, a multi-level, uncertainty-aware meta-learning framework designed to address the patient cold-start problem in medication recommendation. MetaDrug proposes a novel two-level meta-adaptation mechanism, including self-adaptation, which adapts the model to new patients using their own medical events as support sets to capture temporal dependencies; and peer-adaptation, which adapts the model using similar visits from peer patients to enrich new patient representations. Meanwhile, to further improve meta-adaptation outcomes, we introduce an uncertainty quantification module that ranks the support visits and filters out the unrelated information for adaptation consistency. We evaluate our approach on the MIMIC-III and Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) datasets. Experimental results on both datasets demonstrate that MetaDrug consistently outperforms state-of-the-art medication recommendation methods on cold-start patients.",

To address these challenges, we propose a unified definition of behavior style and instantiate it into a practical framework. Building on this, we introduce Style-Conditioned Implicit Q-Learning (SCIQL), which leverages offline goal-conditioned RL techniques, such as hindsight relabeling and value learning, and combine it with a new Gated Advantage Weighted Regression mechanism to efficiently optimize task performance while preserving style alignment. Experiments demonstrate that SCIQL achieves superior performance on both objectives compared to prior offline methods. Code, datasets and visuals are available in: this https URL.",

Unlike traditional hardening tests, which pass at generation time, catching tests are meant to fail, surfacing bugs before code lands. The primary challenge is to reduce development drag from false positive test failures. Analyzing 22,126 generated tests, we show code-change-aware methods improve candidate catch generation 4x over hardening tests and 20x over coincidentally failing tests. To address false positives, we use rule-based and LLM-based assessors. These assessors reduce human review load by 70%. Inferential statistical analysis showed that human-accepted code changes are assessed to have significantly more false positives, while human-rejected changes have significantly more true positives. We reported 41 candidate catches to engineers; 8 were confirmed to be true positives, 4 of which would have led to serious failures had they remained uncaught. Overall, our results show that Just-in-Time catching is scalable, industrially applicable, and that it prevents serious failures from reaching production.",

The learnt extrusion sequences can also be applied to existing meshes - enabling editing in addition to generation. To train our model, we decompose a library of quadrilateral meshes with non-self-intersecting face loops into constituent loops, which can be viewed as their building blocks, and finetune an LLM on the steps for reassembling the meshes by performing a sequence of extrusions. We demonstrate that our representation enables reconstruction, novel shape synthesis, and the addition of new features to existing meshes.",

In industry-scale active learning settings, where generating a single high-fidelity simulation may require days or weeks of computation and produce data volumes on the order of gigabytes, they quickly become impractical. This paper proposes a scalable and reliable Bayesian surrogate model, termed the Bayesian Interpolating Neural Network (B-INN). The B-INN combines high-order interpolation theory with tensor decomposition and alternating direction algorithm to enable effective dimensionality reduction without compromising predictive accuracy. We theoretically show that the function space of a B-INN is a subset of that of Gaussian processes, while its Bayesian inference exhibits linear complexity, $\\mathcal{O}(N)$, with respect to the number of training samples. Numerical experiments demonstrate that B-INNs can be from 20 times to 10,000 times faster with a robust uncertainty estimation compared to Bayesian neural networks and Gaussian processes. These capabilities make B-INN a practical foundation for uncertainty-driven active learning in large-scale industrial simulations, where computational efficiency and robust uncertainty calibration are paramount.",

        "abstract": "Battery energy storage systems are increasingly deployed as fast-responding resources for grid balancing services such as frequency regulation and for mitigating renewable generation uncertainty. However, repeated charging and discharging induces cycling degradation and reduces battery lifetime. This paper studies the real-time scheduling of a heterogeneous battery fleet that collectively tracks a stochastic balancing signal subject to per-battery ramp-rate and capacity constraints, while minimizing long-term cycling degradation. Cycling degradation is fundamentally path-dependent: it is determined by charge-discharge cycles formed by the state-of-charge (SoC) trajectory and is commonly quantified via rainflow cycle counting. This non-Markovian structure makes it difficult to express degradation as an additive per-time-step cost, complicating classical dynamic programming approaches. We address this challenge by formulating the fleet scheduling problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) with constrained action space and designing a dense proxy reward that provides informative feedback at each time step while remaining aligned with long-term cycle-depth reduction. To scale learning to large state-action spaces induced by fine-grained SoC discretization and asymmetric per-battery constraints, we develop a function-approximation reinforcement learning method using an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) as a random nonlinear feature map combined with linear temporal-difference learning. We evaluate the proposed approach on a toy Markovian signal model and on a Markovian model trained from real-world regulation signal traces obtained from the University of Delaware, and demonstrate consistent reductions in cycle-depth occurrence and degradation metrics compared to baseline scheduling policies.",

This paper presents JudgeGPT and RogueGPT, a dual-axis framework that decouples \"authenticity\" from \"attribution\" to investigate the mechanisms of human susceptibility. Analyzing 918 evaluations across five FMs (including GPT-4 and Llama-2), we employ Structural Causal Models (SCMs) as a principal framework for formulating testable causal hypotheses about detection accuracy. Contrary to partisan narratives, we find that political orientation shows a negligible association with detection performance ($r=-0.10$). Instead, \"fake news familiarity\" emerges as a candidate mediator ($r=0.35$), suggesting that exposure may function as adversarial training for human discriminators. We identify a \"fluency trap\" where GPT-4 outputs (HumanMachineScore: 0.20) bypass Source Monitoring mechanisms, rendering them indistinguishable from human text. These findings suggest that \"pre-bunking\" interventions should target cognitive source monitoring rather than demographic segmentation to ensure trustworthy information ecosystems.",

However, many emotion-aware TTS systems, including large language model (LLM)-based designs, rely on scaling fixed emotion embeddings or external guidance, limiting their ability to model emotion-specific latent characteristics. To address this gap, we present EmoShift, a lightweight activation-steering framework incorporating a EmoSteer layer, which learns a steering vector for each target emotion in the output embedding space to capture its latent offset and maintain stable, appropriate expression across utterances and categories. With only 10M trainable parameters,less than 1/30 of full fine-tuning, EmoShift outperforms zero-shot and fully fine-tuned baselines in objective and subjective evaluations, enhancing emotional expressiveness while preserving naturalness and speaker similarity. Further analysis confirms the proposed EmoSteer layer's effectiveness and reveals its potential for controllable emotional intensity in speech synthesis.",

        "abstract": "We study the joint operation and sizing of cooling infrastructure for commercial HVAC systems using reinforcement learning, with the objective of minimizing life-cycle cost over a 30-year horizon. The cooling system consists of a fixed-capacity electric chiller and a thermal energy storage (TES) unit, jointly operated to meet stochastic hourly cooling demands under time-varying electricity prices. The life-cycle cost accounts for both capital expenditure and discounted operating cost, including electricity consumption and maintenance. A key challenge arises from the strong asymmetry in capital costs: increasing chiller capacity by one unit is far more expensive than an equivalent increase in TES capacity. As a result, identifying the right combination of chiller and TES sizes, while ensuring zero loss-of-cooling-load under optimal operation, is a non-trivial co-design problem. To address this, we formulate the chiller operation problem for a fixed infrastructure configuration as a finite-horizon Markov Decision Process (MDP), in which the control action is the chiller part-load ratio (PLR). The MDP is solved using a Deep Q Network (DQN) with a constrained action space. The learned DQN RL policy minimizes electricity cost over historical traces of cooling demand and electricity prices. For each candidate chiller-TES sizing configuration, the trained policy is evaluated. We then restrict attention to configurations that fully satisfy the cooling demand and perform a life-cycle cost minimization over this feasible set to identify the cost-optimal infrastructure design. Using this approach, we determine the optimal chiller and thermal energy storage capacities to be 700 and 1500, respectively.",

Partnering with native linguists, we design an annotated and scalable rule-based LLM transformation to ensure precision. Our approach challenges the assumption that models should mirror users' morphosyntactic features, showing that up to 90% of the grammatical features of a dialect should not be reproduced by models. Independent evaluations confirm data quality, with annotators preferring MDial outputs over prior methods in 98% of pairwise comparisons for dialect naturalness. Using this pipeline, we construct the dialect-parallel $\\textbf{MDialBench}$mark with 50k+ dialogs, resulting in 97k+ QA pairs, and evaluate 17 LLMs on dialect identification and response generation tasks. Even frontier models achieve under 70% accuracy, fail to reach 50% for Canadian English, and systematically misclassify non-SAE dialects as American or British.

Fine-tuned models, by contrast, exhibit the opposite behavior, attaining a lower overall G-measure of 51% but substantially higher precision of 75% at the cost of reduced recall of 36%. Though a one-time investment in building fine-tuned models is necessary, the inference on the largest dataset is up to 50 times faster than that of proprietary models.

These methods typically employ supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to adapt LLMs to recommendation scenarios, and utilize beam search during inference to efficiently retrieve $B$ top-ranked recommended items. However, we identify a critical training-inference inconsistency: while SFT optimizes the overall probability of positive items, it does not guarantee that such items will be retrieved by beam search even if they possess high overall probabilities. Due to the greedy pruning mechanism, beam search can prematurely discard a positive item once its prefix probability is insufficient. To address this inconsistency, we propose BEAR (Beam-SEarch-Aware Regularization), a novel fine-tuning objective that explicitly accounts for beam search behavior during training. Rather than directly simulating beam search for each instance during training, which is computationally prohibitive, BEAR enforces a relaxed necessary condition: each token in a positive item must rank within the top-$B$ candidate tokens at each decoding step. This objective effectively mitigates the risk of incorrect pruning while incurring negligible computational overhead compared to standard SFT. Extensive experiments across four real-world datasets demonstrate that BEAR significantly outperforms strong baselines. Code will be released upon acceptance.",

Integrating Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown promise in addressing \"long-tail\" scenarios.

To overcome this limitation, we present MTDrive, a multi-turn framework that enables MLLMs to iteratively refine trajectories based on environmental feedback. MTDrive introduces Multi-Turn Group Relative Policy Optimization (mtGRPO), which mitigates reward sparsity by computing relative advantages across turns. We further construct an interactive trajectory understanding dataset from closed-loop simulation to support multi-turn training. Experiments on the NAVSIM benchmark demonstrate superior performance compared to existing methods, validating the effectiveness of our multi-turn reasoning paradigm. Additionally, we implement system-level optimizations to reduce data transfer overhead caused by high-resolution images and multi-turn sequences, achieving 2.5x training throughput.

We fine-tune a \\texttt{Mellum} model using DP and conduct a comprehensive evaluation of its privacy and utility. Our results demonstrate that DP provides a strong defense against Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs), reducing the attack's success rate close to a random guess (AUC from 0.901 to 0.606). Furthermore, we show that this privacy guarantee comes at a minimal cost to model performance, with the DP-trained model achieving utility scores comparable to its non-private counterpart, even when trained on 100x less data. Our findings suggest that DP is a practical and effective solution for building private and trustworthy AI-powered IDE features.",

Traditional RGB surveillance raises significant concerns regarding visual recording and storage, while existing privacy-preserving methods-ranging from physical desensitization to traditional cryptographic or obfuscation techniques-often compromise semantic understanding capabilities or fail to guarantee mathematical irreversibility against reconstruction attacks. To address these challenges, this study presents a novel privacy-preserving perception technology based on the AI Flow theoretical framework and an edge-cloud collaborative architecture. The proposed methodology integrates source desensitization with irreversible feature mapping. Leveraging Information Bottleneck theory, the edge device performs millisecond-level processing to transform raw imagery into abstract feature vectors via non-linear mapping and stochastic noise injection. This process constructs a unidirectional information flow that strips identity-sensitive attributes, rendering the reconstruction of original images impossible. Subsequently, the cloud platform utilizes multimodal family models to perform joint inference solely on these abstract vectors to detect abnormal behaviors. This approach fundamentally severs the path to privacy leakage at the architectural level, achieving a breakthrough from video surveillance to de-identified behavior perception and offering a robust solution for risk management in high-sensitivity public spaces.",

Prior studies have pointed out several limitations of perplexity, often from an empirical manner. Here we leverage recent results on Transformer continuity to show in a rigorous manner how perplexity may be an unsuitable metric for model selection. Specifically, we prove that, if there is any sequence that a compact decoder-only Transformer model predicts accurately and confidently -- a necessary pre-requisite for strong generalisation -- it must imply existence of another sequence with very low perplexity, but not predicted correctly by that same model. Further, by analytically studying iso-perplexity plots, we find that perplexity will not always select for the more accurate model -- rather, any increase in model confidence must be accompanied by a commensurate rise in accuracy for the new model to be selected.",

        "abstract": "Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to purely autoregressive language models because they can decode multiple tokens in parallel. However, state-of-the-art block-wise dLLMs rely on a \"remasking\" mechanism that decodes only the most confident tokens and discards the rest, effectively wasting computation. We demonstrate that recycling computation from the discarded tokens is beneficial, as these tokens retain contextual information useful for subsequent decoding iterations. In light of this, we propose Residual Context Diffusion (RCD), a module that converts these discarded token representations into contextual residuals and injects them back for the next denoising step. RCD uses a decoupled two-stage training pipeline to bypass the memory bottlenecks associated with backpropagation. We validate our method on both long CoT reasoning (SDAR) and short CoT instruction following (LLaDA) models. We demonstrate that a standard dLLM can be efficiently converted to the RCD paradigm with merely ~1 billion tokens. RCD consistently improves frontier dLLMs by 5-10 points in accuracy with minimal extra computation overhead across a wide range of benchmarks. Notably, on the most challenging AIME tasks, RCD nearly doubles baseline accuracy and attains up to 4-5x fewer denoising steps at equivalent accuracy levels.",

Current approaches attempt to enforce smoothness by directly regularizing the policy's output. We argue that this approach treats the symptom rather than the cause. In this work, we theoretically establish that policy non-smoothness is fundamentally governed by the differential geometry of the critic. By applying implicit differentiation to the actor-critic objective, we prove that the sensitivity of the optimal policy is bounded by the ratio of the Q-function's mixed-partial derivative (noise sensitivity) to its action-space curvature (signal distinctness). To empirically validate this theoretical insight, we introduce PAVE (Policy-Aware Value-field Equalization), a critic-centric regularization framework that treats the critic as a scalar field and stabilizes its induced action-gradient field. PAVE rectifies the learning signal by minimizing the Q-gradient volatility while preserving local curvature. Experimental results demonstrate that PAVE achieves smoothness and robustness comparable to policy-side smoothness regularization methods, while maintaining competitive task performance, without modifying the actor.",

Conventional slice-to-volume reconstruction (SVR) methods are time-consuming and require multiple orthogonal stacks for reconstruction. While learning-based SVR approaches have significantly reduced the time required at the inference stage, they heavily rely on ground truth information for training, which is inaccessible in practice. To address these challenges, we propose GaussianSVR, a self-supervised framework for slice-to-volume reconstruction. GaussianSVR represents the target volume using 3D Gaussian representations to achieve high-fidelity reconstruction. It leverages a simulated forward slice acquisition model to enable self-supervised training, alleviating the need for ground-truth volumes. Furthermore, to enhance both accuracy and efficiency, we introduce a multi-resolution training strategy that jointly optimizes Gaussian parameters and spatial transformations across different resolution levels. Experiments show that GaussianSVR outperforms the baseline methods on fetal MR volumetric reconstruction. Code will be available upon acceptance.",

To address this gap, we present a large-scale multilingual evaluation of political bias spanning 50 countries and 33 languages. We introduce a complementary post-hoc mitigation framework, Cross-Lingual Alignment Steering (CLAS), designed to augment existing steering methods by aligning ideological representations across languages and dynamically regulating intervention strength. This method aligns latent ideological representations induced by political prompts into a shared ideological subspace, ensuring cross lingual consistency, with the adaptive mechanism prevents over correction and preserves coherence.

In this work, we propose Continuous Constraint Interpolation (CCI), a unified optimization framework in which these three constraint families arise as special cases along a common constraint spectrum. The CCI framework introduces a single interpolation parameter that enables smooth transitions and principled combinations across constraint types. Building on CCI, we develop Automatic Constraint Policy Optimization (ACPO), a practical primal--dual algorithm that adapts the interpolation parameter via a Lagrangian dual update. Moreover, we establish a maximum-entropy performance difference lemma and derive performance lower bounds for both the closed-form optimal policy and its parametric projection.

While recent graph generation methods employ generative adversarial network (GAN) frameworks to handle permutation invariance and irregular topologies, they typically rely on random edge sampling with fixed probabilities, limiting their capacity to capture complex structural dependencies between nodes. We propose a density-aware conditional graph generation framework using Wasserstein GANs (WGAN) that replaces random sampling with a learnable distance-based edge predictor. Our approach embeds nodes into a latent space where proximity correlates with edge likelihood, enabling the generator to learn meaningful connectivity patterns. A differentiable edge predictor determines pairwise relationships directly from node embeddings, while a density-aware selection mechanism adaptively controls edge density to match class-specific sparsity distributions observed in real graphs. We train the model using a WGAN with gradient penalty, employing a GCN-based critic to ensure generated graphs exhibit realistic topology and align with target class distributions. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method produces graphs with superior structural coherence and class-consistent connectivity compared to existing baselines. The learned edge predictor captures complex relational patterns beyond simple heuristics, generating graphs whose density and topology closely match real structural distributions. Our results show improved training stability and controllable synthesis, making the framework effective for realistic graph generation and data augmentation.

In this study, we investigate how the presence or absence of comments, both during training and at inference time, impacts the bug-fixing capabilities of LLMs. We conduct an empirical evaluation comparing two model families, each evaluated under all combinations of training and inference conditions (with and without comments), and thereby revisiting the common practice of removing comments during training. To address the limited availability of comments in state-of-the-art datasets, we use an LLM to automatically generate comments for methods lacking them. Our findings show that comments improve ABF accuracy by up to threefold when present in both phases, while training with comments does not degrade performance when instances lack them.

Consequently, fake speech with natural semantics can bypass detectors despite harboring subtle acoustic anomalies; this suggests that the challenge stems not from the absence of acoustic data, but from its inadequate accessibility when semantic-dominant reasoning prevails. To address this issue, we investigate SDD within the audio LLM paradigm and introduce SDD with Auditory Perception-enhanced Audio Large Language Model (SDD-APALLM), an acoustically enhanced framework designed to explicitly expose fine-grained time-frequency evidence as accessible acoustic cues. By combining raw audio with structured spectrograms, the proposed framework empowers audio LLMs to more effectively capture subtle acoustic inconsistencies without compromising their semantic understanding. Experimental results indicate consistent gains in detection accuracy and robustness, especially in cases where semantic cues are misleading.

Shapley values are a widely used approach for explaining model predictions, but require direct access to the underlying model, an assumption frequently violated in real-world deployments.

We investigate whether meaningful Shapley value estimations can be obtained in a zero-shot setting, using only the input data distribution and no evaluations of the target model. To this end, we introduce ExplainerPFN, a tabular foundation model built on TabPFN that is pretrained on synthetic datasets generated from random structural causal models and supervised using exact or near-exact Shapley values. Once trained, ExplainerPFN predicts feature attributions for unseen tabular datasets without model access, gradients, or example explanations. Our contributions are fourfold: (1) we show that few-shot learning-based explanations can achieve high fidelity to SHAP values with as few as two reference observations; (2) we propose ExplainerPFN, the first zero-shot method for estimating Shapley values without access to the underlying model or reference explanations; (3) we provide an open-source implementation of ExplainerPFN, including the full training pipeline and synthetic data generator; and (4) through extensive experiments on real and synthetic datasets, we show that ExplainerPFN achieves performance competitive with few-shot surrogate explainers that rely on 2-10 SHAP examples.",

Prior explanations mainly attribute this phenomenon to the generalization of erroneous or unsafe content. In this work, we show that this view is incomplete. Across multiple domains and model families, we find that fine-tuning models on data exhibiting specific character-level dispositions induces substantially stronger and more transferable misalignment than incorrect-advice fine-tuning, while largely preserving general capabilities. This indicates that emergent misalignment arises from stable shifts in model behavior rather than from capability degradation or corrupted knowledge. We further show that such behavioral dispositions can be conditionally activated by both training-time triggers and inference-time persona-aligned prompts, revealing shared structure across emergent misalignment, backdoor activation, and jailbreak susceptibility. Overall, our results identify character formation as a central and underexplored alignment risk, suggesting that robust alignment must address behavioral dispositions rather than isolated errors or prompt-level defenses.",

        "abstract": "Resolving complex information needs that come with multiple constraints should consider enforcing the logical operators encoded in the query (i.e., conjunction, disjunction, negation) on the candidate answer set. Current retrieval systems either ignore these constraints in neural embeddings or approximate them in a generative reasoning process that can be inconsistent and unreliable. Although well-suited to structured reasoning, existing neuro-symbolic approaches remain confined to formal logic or mathematics problems as they often assume unambiguous queries and access to complete evidence, conditions rarely met in information retrieval. To bridge this gap, we introduce OrLog, a neuro-symbolic retrieval framework that decouples predicate-level plausibility estimation from logical reasoning: a large language model (LLM) provides plausibility scores for atomic predicates in one decoding-free forward pass, from which a probabilistic reasoning engine derives the posterior probability of query satisfaction. We evaluate OrLog across multiple backbone LLMs, varying levels of access to external knowledge, and a range of logical constraints, and compare it against base retrievers and LLM-as-reasoner methods. Provided with entity descriptions, OrLog can significantly boost top-rank precision compared to LLM reasoning with larger gains on disjunctive queries. OrLog is also more efficient, cutting mean tokens by $\\sim$90\\% per query-entity pair. These results demonstrate that generation-free predicate plausibility estimation combined with probabilistic reasoning enables constraint-aware retrieval that outperforms monolithic reasoning while using far fewer tokens.",

By utilizing semantic embedding vectors as cache keys, this mechanism effectively minimizes latency and redundant computation for semantically similar queries. In this work, we conceptualize semantic cache keys as a form of fuzzy hashes. We demonstrate that the locality required to maximize cache hit rates fundamentally conflicts with the cryptographic avalanche effect necessary for collision resistance. Our conceptual analysis formalizes this inherent trade-off between performance (locality) and security (collision resilience), revealing that semantic caching is naturally vulnerable to key collision attacks. While prior research has focused on side-channel and privacy risks, we present the first systematic study of integrity risks arising from cache collisions. We introduce CacheAttack, an automated framework for launching black-box collision attacks. We evaluate CacheAttack in security-critical tasks and agentic workflows. It achieves a hit rate of 86\\% in LLM response hijacking and can induce malicious behaviors in LLM agent, while preserving strong transferability across different embedding models. A case study on a financial agent further illustrates the real-world impact of these vulnerabilities. Finally, we discuss mitigation strategies.",

In this work, we uncover a counter-intuitive optimization anomaly: models trained on short horizons-when coupled with our proposed Evolutionary Forecasting (EF) paradigm-significantly outperform those trained directly on long horizons. We attribute this success to the mitigation of a fundamental optimization pathology inherent in DF, where conflicting gradients from distant futures cripple the learning of local dynamics. We establish EF as a unified generative framework, proving that DF is merely a degenerate special case of EF. Extensive experiments demonstrate that a singular EF model surpasses task-specific DF ensembles across standard benchmarks and exhibits robust asymptotic stability in extreme extrapolation. This work propels a paradigm shift in LTSF: moving from passive Static Mapping to autonomous Evolutionary Reasoning.",

Many approaches have been proposed over the years to promote the generalisation ability of neural networks, collectively known as regularisation techniques. These are used as common practice under the assumption that any regularisation added to the pipeline would result in a performance improvement. In this study, we investigate whether this assumption holds in practice. First, we provide a broad review of regularisation techniques, including modern theories such as double descent. We propose a taxonomy of methods under four broad categories, namely: (1) data-based strategies, (2) architecture strategies, (3) training strategies, and (4) loss function strategies. Notably, we highlight the contradictions and correspondences between the approaches in these broad classes. Further, we perform an empirical comparison of the various regularisation techniques on classification tasks for ten numerical and image datasets applied to the multi-layer perceptron and convolutional neural network architectures. Results show that the efficacy of regularisation is dataset-dependent. For example, the use of a regularisation term only improved performance on numeric datasets, whereas batch normalisation improved performance on image datasets only. Generalisation is crucial to machine learning; thus, understanding the effects of applying regularisation techniques, and considering the connections between them is essential to the appropriate use of these methods in practice.",

To address this gap, we propose a novel Secure Tool Manifest and Digital Signing Framework, a structured and security-aware extension of Model Context Protocols. The framework enforces cryptographically signed manifests, integrates transparent verification logs, and isolates model-internal execution metadata from user-visible components to ensure verifiable execution integrity. Furthermore, the evaluation demonstrates that the framework scales nearly linearly (R-squared = 0.998), achieves near-perfect acceptance of valid executions while consistently rejecting invalid ones, and maintains balanced model utilization across execution pipelines.",

However, IoT systems are vulnerable to clock drift, time-synchronization manipulation, and timestamp discontinuities, such as the Year 2038 (Y2K38) Unix overflow, all of which disrupt temporal ordering. Conventional anomaly-detection models, which assume reliable timestamps, fail to capture temporal inconsistencies. This paper introduces STGAT (Spatio-Temporal Graph Attention Network), a framework that models both temporal distortion and inter-device consistency in energy IoT systems. STGAT combines drift-aware temporal embeddings and temporal self-attention to capture corrupted time evolution at individual devices, and uses graph attention to model spatial propagation of timing errors. A curvature-regularized latent representation geometrically separates normal clock evolution from anomalies caused by drift, synchronization offsets, and overflow events. Experimental results on energy IoT telemetry with controlled timing perturbations show that STGAT achieves 95.7% accuracy, outperforming recurrent, transformer, and graph-based baselines with significant improvements (d > 1.8, p < 0.001). Additionally, STGAT reduces detection delay by 26%, achieving a 2.3-time-step delay while maintaining stable performance under overflow, drift, and physical inconsistencies.",

Reinforcement learning can help address this challenge by learning medication dosing policies from retrospective data. However, prior work on sedation and analgesia has optimized for objectives that do not value patient survival while relying on algorithms unsuitable for imperfect information settings. We investigated the risks of these design choices by implementing a deep reinforcement learning framework to suggest hourly medication doses under partial observability. Using data from 47,144 ICU stays in the MIMIC-IV database, we trained policies to prescribe opioids, propofol, benzodiazepines, and dexmedetomidine according to two goals: reduce pain or jointly reduce pain and mortality. We found that, although the two policies were associated with lower pain, actions from the first policy were positively correlated with mortality, while those proposed by the second policy were negatively correlated. This suggests that valuing long-term outcomes could be critical for safer treatment policies, even if a short-term goal remains the primary objective.",

We formalize this via an $\\varepsilon$-decomposition that quantifies the deviation from ideal submodularity as a function of conflict statistics, yielding data-dependent approximation factors that tighten as conflicts diminish. Guided by this analysis, we propose SPICE, a conflict-aware selector that maximizes information while penalizing misalignment, and that supports early stopping and proxy models for efficiency. Empirically, SPICE selects subsets with higher log-determinant information than original criteria, and these informational gains translate into performance improvements: across 8 benchmarks with LLaMA2-7B and Qwen2-7B, SPICE uses only 10% of the data, yet matches or exceeds 6 methods including full-data tuning.

However, it remains unclear how accuracy and decision commitment evolve along a reasoning trajectory, and whether intermediate trace segments provide answer-relevant information beyond generic length or stylistic effects. Here, we propose a protocol to systematically probe the trajectories of reasoning traces in LLMs by 1) generating a model's reasoning trace, 2) truncating it at fixed token-percentiles, and 3) injecting each partial trace back into the model (or a different model) to measure the induced distribution over answer choices via next-token probabilities. We apply this protocol to the open-source Qwen3-4B/-8B/-14B and gpt-oss-20b/-120b models across the multiple-choice GPQA Diamond and MMLU-Pro benchmarks. We find that accuracy and decision commitment consistently increase as the percentage of provided reasoning tokens grows. These gains are primarily driven by relevant content in the model generation rather than context length or generic \"reasoning style\" effects. Stronger models often backtrack successfully from incorrect partial traces, but immediate answers often remain anchored in the weaker model's incorrect response. More broadly, we show that trajectory probing provides diagnostics for efficient and safer deployment of reasoning models as the measurements can inform practical trace-handling and monitoring policies that improve reliability without assuming intermediate tokens are inherently faithful explanations.",

        "abstract": "Neural audio codecs are at the core of modern conversational speech technologies, converting continuous speech into sequences of discrete tokens that can be processed by LLMs. However, existing codecs typically operate at fixed frame rates, allocating tokens uniformly in time and producing unnecessarily long sequences. In this work, we introduce DyCAST, a Dynamic Character-Aligned Speech Tokenizer that enables variable-frame-rate tokenization through soft character-level alignment and explicit duration modeling. DyCAST learns to associate tokens with character-level linguistic units during training and supports alignment-free inference with direct control over token durations at decoding time. To improve speech resynthesis quality at low frame rates, we further introduce a retrieval-augmented decoding mechanism that enhances reconstruction fidelity without increasing bitrate. Experiments show that DyCAST achieves competitive speech resynthesis quality and downstream performance while using significantly fewer tokens than fixed-frame-rate codecs.",

        "abstract": "Understanding what graph neural networks can learn, especially their ability to learn to execute algorithms, remains a central theoretical challenge. In this work, we prove exact learnability results for graph algorithms under bounded-degree and finite-precision constraints. Our approach follows a two-step process. First, we train an ensemble of multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) to execute the local instructions of a single node. Second, during inference, we use the trained MLP ensemble as the update function within a graph neural network (GNN). Leveraging Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory, we show that local instructions can be learned from a small training set, enabling the complete graph algorithm to be executed during inference without error and with high probability. To illustrate the learning power of our setting, we establish a rigorous learnability result for the LOCAL model of distributed computation. We further demonstrate positive learnability results for widely studied algorithms such as message flooding, breadth-first and depth-first search, and Bellman-Ford.",

        "abstract": "Multispecific antibodies offer transformative therapeutic potential by engaging multiple epitopes simultaneously, yet their efficacy is an emergent property governed by complex molecular architectures. Rational design is often bottlenecked by the inability to predict how subtle changes in domain topology influence functional outcomes, a challenge exacerbated by the scarcity of comprehensive experimental data. Here, we introduce a computational framework to address part of this gap. First, we present a generative method for creating large-scale, realistic synthetic functional landscapes that capture non-linear interactions where biological activity depends on domain connectivity. Second, we propose a graph neural network architecture that explicitly encodes these topological constraints, distinguishing between format configurations that appear identical to sequence-only models. We demonstrate that this model, trained on synthetic landscapes, recapitulates complex functional properties and, via transfer learning, has the potential to achieve high predictive accuracy on limited biological datasets. We showcase the model's utility by optimizing trade-offs between efficacy and toxicity in trispecific T-cell engagers and retrieving optimal common light chains. This work provides a robust benchmarking environment for disentangling the combinatorial complexity of multispecifics, accelerating the design of next-generation therapeutics.",

A natural way to expand capability is to scale up the agent pool by continually integrating new functional agents or tool interfaces, but naive expansion can trigger performance collapse when the router cold-starts on newly added, heterogeneous, and unreliable agents. We propose MonoScale, an expansion-aware update framework that proactively generates a small set of agent-conditioned familiarization tasks, harvests evidence from both successful and failed interactions, and distills it into auditable natural-language memory to guide future routing. We formalize sequential augmentation as a contextual bandit and perform trust-region memory updates, yielding a monotonic non-decreasing performance guarantee across onboarding rounds. Experiments on GAIA and Humanity's Last Exam show stable gains as the agent pool grows, outperforming naive scale-up and strong-router fixed-pool baselines.",

        "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning (RL) is increasingly deployed in resource-constrained environments, yet the go-to function approximators - multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) - are often parameter-inefficient due to an imperfect inductive bias for the smooth structure of many value functions. This mismatch can also hinder sample efficiency and slow policy learning in this capacity-limited regime. Although model compression techniques exist, they operate post-hoc and do not improve learning efficiency. Recent spline-based separable architectures - such as Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) - have been shown to offer parameter efficiency but are widely reported to exhibit significant computational overhead, especially at scale. In seeking to address these limitations, this work introduces SPAN (SPline-based Adaptive Networks), a novel function approximation approach to RL. SPAN adapts the low rank KHRONOS framework by integrating a learnable preprocessing layer with a separable tensor product B-spline basis. SPAN is evaluated across discrete (PPO) and high-dimensional continuous (SAC) control tasks, as well as offline settings (Minari/D4RL). Empirical results demonstrate that SPAN achieves a 30-50% improvement in sample efficiency and 1.3-9 times higher success rates across benchmarks compared to MLP baselines. Furthermore, SPAN demonstrates superior anytime performance and robustness to hyperparameter variations, suggesting it as a viable, high performance alternative for learning intrinsically efficient policies in resource-limited settings.",

In this view, self-attention implements a gradient step of an interaction energy, while MLP layers correspond to gradient updates of a potential energy. Standard GPT-style transformers emerge as vanilla gradient descent on the resulting composite objective, implemented via Lie--Trotter splitting between these two energy functionals. This perspective enables principled architectural design using classical optimization ideas. As a proof of concept, we introduce a Nesterov-style accelerated transformer that preserves the same attention and MLP oracles. The resulting architecture consistently outperforms a nanoGPT baseline on TinyStories and OpenWebText, demonstrating that optimization-theoretic insights can translate into practical gains.",

This transition, however, introduces a distinct class of vulnerabilities that remain largely uncharacterized. We examine the security implications of this modality shift by designing a text-to-audio jailbreak that embeds disallowed directives within a narrative-style audio stream. The attack leverages an advanced instruction-following text-to-speech (TTS) model to exploit structural and acoustic properties, thereby circumventing safety mechanisms primarily calibrated for text. When delivered through synthetic speech, the narrative format elicits restricted outputs from state-of-the-art models, including Gemini 2.0 Flash, achieving a 98.26% success rate that substantially exceeds text-only baselines. These results highlight the need for safety frameworks that jointly reason over linguistic and paralinguistic representations, particularly as speech-based interfaces become more prevalent.",

Training begins with imitation from an expert finite state machine (FSM) controller to provide a stable initialization. Environment terms are combined with an IRL discriminator signal to align with expert goals. Reinforcement learning (RL) is then performed with a hybrid reward that combines diffuse environmental feedback and targeted IRL rewards. A conditional diffusion model, which acts as a safety supervisor, plans safe paths. It stays in its lane, avoids obstacles, and moves smoothly. Then, a learnable adaptive mask (LAM) improves perception. It shifts visual attention based on vehicle speed and nearby hazards. After FSM-based imitation, the policy is fine-tuned with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Training is run in the Webots simulator with a two-stage curriculum. A 96\\% success rate is reached, and collisions are reduced to 0.05 per 1k steps, marking a new benchmark for safe navigation. By applying the proposed approach, the agent not only drives in lane but also handles unsafe conditions at an expert level, increasing this http URL make our code publicly available.",

This is a central challenge in human-robot interaction, where systems must be successful while being mindful of user agency. Previous approaches relied on static blending ratios or separated goal inference from assistance arbitration, leading to suboptimal performance in unstructured environments. We introduce BRACE (Bayesian Reinforcement Assistance with Context Encoding), a novel framework that fine-tunes Bayesian intent inference and context-adaptive assistance through an architecture enabling end-to-end gradient flow between intent inference and assistance arbitration. Our pipeline conditions collaborative control policies on environmental context and complete goal probability distributions. We provide analysis showing (1) optimal assistance levels should decrease with goal uncertainty and increase with environmental constraint severity, and (2) integrating belief information into policy learning yields a quadratic expected regret advantage over sequential approaches. We validated our algorithm against SOTA methods (IDA, DQN) using a three-part evaluation progressively isolating distinct challenges of end-effector control: (1) core human-interaction dynamics in a 2D human-in-the-loop cursor task, (2) non-linear dynamics of a robotic arm, and (3) integrated manipulation under goal ambiguity and environmental constraints. We demonstrate improvements over SOTA, achieving 6.3% higher success rates and 41% increased path efficiency, and 36.3% success rate and 87% path efficiency improvement over unassisted control. Our results confirmed that integrated optimization is most beneficial in complex, goal-ambiguous scenarios, and is generalizable across robotic domains requiring goal-directed assistance, advancing the SOTA for adaptive shared autonomy.",
