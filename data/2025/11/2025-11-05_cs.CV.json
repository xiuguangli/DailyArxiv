        "abstract": "We introduce iFlyBot-VLA, a large-scale Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model trained under a novel framework. The main contributions are listed as follows: (1) a latent action model thoroughly trained on large-scale human and robotic manipulation videos; (2) a dual-level action representation framework that jointly supervises both the Vision-Language Model (VLM) and the action expert during training; (3) a mixed training strategy that combines robot trajectory data with general QA and spatial QA datasets, effectively enhancing the 3D perceptual and reasoning capabilities of the VLM backbone. Specifically, the VLM is trained to predict two complementary forms of actions: latent actions, derived from our latent action model pretrained on cross-embodiment manipulation data, which capture implicit high-level intentions; and structured discrete action tokens, obtained through frequency-domain transformations of continuous control signals, which encode explicit low-level dynamics. This dual supervision aligns the representation spaces of language, vision, and action, enabling the VLM to directly contribute to action generation. Experimental results on the LIBERO Franka benchmark demonstrate the superiority of our frame-work, while real-world evaluations further show that iFlyBot-VLA achieves competitive success rates across diverse and challenging manipulation tasks. Furthermore, we plan to open-source a portion of our self-constructed dataset to support future research in the community",

        "abstract": "Purpose: This study provides the first comprehensive evaluation of foundation models in fetal ultrasound (US) imaging under low inter-class variability conditions. While recent vision foundation models such as DINOv3 have shown remarkable transferability across medical domains, their ability to discriminate anatomically similar structures has not been systematically investigated. We address this gap by focusing on fetal brain standard planes--transthalamic (TT), transventricular (TV), and transcerebellar (TC)--which exhibit highly overlapping anatomical features and pose a critical challenge for reliable biometric assessment. Methods: To ensure a fair and reproducible evaluation, all publicly available fetal ultrasound datasets were curated and aggregated into a unified multicenter benchmark, FetalUS-188K, comprising more than 188,000 annotated images from heterogeneous acquisition settings. DINOv3 was pretrained in a self-supervised manner to learn ultrasound-aware representations. The learned features were then evaluated through standardized adaptation protocols, including linear probing with frozen backbone and full fine-tuning, under two initialization schemes: (i) pretraining on FetalUS-188K and (ii) initialization from natural-image DINOv3 weights. Results: Models pretrained on fetal ultrasound data consistently outperformed those initialized on natural images, with weighted F1-score improvements of up to 20 percent. Domain-adaptive pretraining enabled the network to preserve subtle echogenic and structural cues crucial for distinguishing intermediate planes such as TV. Conclusion: Results demonstrate that generic foundation models fail to generalize under low inter-class variability, whereas domain-specific pretraining is essential to achieve robust and clinically reliable representations in fetal brain ultrasound imaging.",

        "abstract": "Geo-Foundational Models (GFMs) enable fast and reliable extraction of spatiotemporal information from satellite imagery, improving flood inundation mapping by leveraging location and time embeddings. Despite their potential, it remains unclear whether GFMs outperform traditional models like U-Net. A systematic comparison across sensors and data availability scenarios is still lacking, which is an essential step to guide end-users in model selection. To address this, we evaluate three GFMs, Prithvi 2.0, Clay V1.5, DOFA, and UViT (a Prithvi variant), against TransNorm, U-Net, and Attention U-Net using PlanetScope, Sentinel-1, and Sentinel-2. We observe competitive performance among all GFMs, with only 2-5% variation between the best and worst models across sensors. Clay outperforms others on PlanetScope (0.79 mIoU) and Sentinel-2 (0.70), while Prithvi leads on Sentinel-1 (0.57). In leave-one-region-out cross-validation across five regions, Clay shows slightly better performance across all sensors (mIoU: 0.72(0.04), 0.66(0.07), 0.51(0.08)) compared to Prithvi (0.70(0.05), 0.64(0.09), 0.49(0.13)) and DOFA (0.67(0.07), 0.64(0.04), 0.49(0.09)) for PlanetScope, Sentinel-2, and Sentinel-1, respectively. Across all 19 sites, leave-one-region-out cross-validation reveals a 4% improvement by Clay compared to U-Net. Visual inspection highlights Clay's superior ability to retain fine details. Few-shot experiments show Clay achieves 0.64 mIoU on PlanetScope with just five training images, outperforming Prithvi (0.24) and DOFA (0.35). In terms of computational time, Clay is a better choice due to its smaller model size (26M parameters), making it ~3x faster than Prithvi (650M) and 2x faster than DOFA (410M). Contrary to previous findings, our results suggest GFMs offer small to moderate improvements in flood mapping accuracy at lower computational cost and labeling effort compared to traditional U-Net.",

Conventional supervised approaches require fully sampled ground truth data, while self-supervised methods allow incomplete ground truth but typically rely on random sampling that, in expectation, covers the entire image. In contrast, we consider fixed, deterministic sampling patterns with inherently incomplete coverage, even in expectation. To overcome this limitation, we exploit multiple invariances of the underlying image distribution, which theoretically allows us to achieve the same reconstruction performance as fully supervised approaches. We validate our method on optical-resolution image upsampling in photoacoustic microscopy (PAM), demonstrating competitive or superior results while requiring substantially less ground truth data.",

Traditional detection methodologies predominantly utilize Optical Character Recognition (OCR) models in conjunction with named entity recognition. However, recent advancements in Large Multimodal Model (LMM) present new opportunities for enhanced text extraction and semantic analysis. In this study, we systematically benchmark three prominent closed and open-sourced LMMs, namely GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Qwen 2.5 7B, utilizing two distinct pipeline configurations: one dedicated to text analysis alone and another integrating both OCR and semantic analysis. Our results indicate that LMM exhibits superior OCR efficacy (WER: 0.03-0.05, CER: 0.02-0.03) compared to conventional models like EasyOCR. However, this improvement in OCR performance does not consistently correlate with enhanced overall PHI detection accuracy. The strongest performance gains are observed on test cases with complex imprint patterns. In scenarios where text regions are well readable with sufficient contrast, and strong LMMs are employed for text analysis after OCR, different pipeline configurations yield similar results. Furthermore, we provide empirically grounded recommendations for LMM selection tailored to specific operational constraints and propose a deployment strategy that leverages scalable and modular infrastructure.",

We propose a pipeline for automated synthesis for text-VQA dataset that can produce faithful QA pairs, and which scales up with the availability of scene text data. Our proposed method harnesses the capabilities of multiple models and algorithms involving OCR detection and recognition (text spotting), region of interest (ROI) detection, caption generation, and question generation.

Methods: On HoloLens 2, we align Articulated HAnd Tracking (AHAT) depth to Computed Tomography (CT)-derived skin meshes via (i) depth-bias correction, (ii) brief human-in-the-loop initialization, (iii) global and local registration. We validated the surface-tracing error metric by comparing \"skin-to-bone\" relative distances to CT ground truth on leg and foot models, using an AR-tracked tool. We then performed seven intraoperative target trials (feet x2, ear x3, leg x2) during the initial stage of fibula free-flap harvest and mandibular reconstruction surgery, and collected 500+ data per trial. Results: Preclinical validation showed tight agreement between AR-traced and CT distances (leg: median |Delta d| 0.78 mm, RMSE 0.97 mm; feet: 0.80 mm, 1.20 mm). Clinically, per-point error had a median of 3.9 mm. Median errors by anatomy were 3.2 mm (feet), 4.3 mm (ear), and 5.3 mm (lower leg), with 5 mm coverage 92-95%, 84-90%, and 72-86%, respectively. Feet vs. lower leg differed significantly (Delta median ~1.1 mm; p < 0.001). Conclusion: A depth-only, markerless AR pipeline on HMDs achieved ~3-4 mm median error across feet, ear, and lower leg in live surgical settings without fiducials, approaching typical clinical error thresholds for moderate-risk tasks. Human-guided initialization plus global-to-local registration enabled accurate alignment on small or low-curvature targets, improving the clinical readiness of markerless AR guidance.",

Understanding their chamber growth trajectory provides crucial insights into organismal development and ecological adaptation under changing environments.

In this study, we propose an end-to-end pipeline that integrates instance segmentation, a computer vision technique not extensively explored in foraminifera, with a dedicated chamber ordering algorithm to automatically reconstruct three-dimensional growth trajectories from high-resolution computed tomography scans. We quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate multiple instance segmentation methods, each optimized for distinct spatial features of the chambers, and examine their downstream influence on growth-order reconstruction accuracy. Experimental results on expert-annotated datasets demonstrate that the proposed pipeline substantially reduces manual effort while maintaining biologically meaningful accuracy. Although segmentation models exhibit under-segmentation in smaller chambers due to reduced voxel fidelity and subtle inter-chamber connectivity, the chamber-ordering algorithm remains robust, achieving consistent reconstruction of developmental trajectories even under partial segmentation. This work provides the first fully automated and reproducible pipeline for digital foraminiferal growth analysis, establishing a foundation for large-scale, data-driven ecological studies.",

To overcome these limitations, this study introduces a cascaded framework integrating Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Robust PCA (RPCA) for efficient crack width extraction from digital images. The proposed methodology comprises three sequential stages: (1) initial crack segmentation using established detection algorithms to generate a binary representation, (2) determination of the primary orientation axis for quasi-parallel cracks through PCA, and (3) extraction of the Main Propagation Axis (MPA) for irregular crack geometries using RPCA.

This paper introduces an innovative autonomous mechanism for tuning the biases of event cameras, effectively addressing flicker across a wide frequency range -25 Hz to 500 Hz. Unlike traditional methods that rely on additional hardware or software for flicker filtering, our approach leverages the event cameras inherent bias settings. Utilizing a simple Convolutional Neural Networks -CNNs, the system identifies instances of flicker in a spatial space and dynamically adjusts specific biases to minimize its impact. The efficacy of this autobiasing system was robustly tested using a face detector framework under both well-lit and low-light conditions, as well as across various frequencies. The results demonstrated significant improvements: enhanced YOLO confidence metrics for face detection, and an increased percentage of frames capturing detected faces. Moreover, the average gradient, which serves as an indicator of flicker presence through edge detection, decreased by 38.2 percent in well-lit conditions and by 53.6 percent in low-light conditions. These findings underscore the potential of our approach to significantly improve the functionality of event cameras in a range of adverse lighting scenarios.",

        "abstract": "In this technical report, we introduce a framework to address Grounded Video Question Answering (GVQA) task for the ICCV 2025 Perception Test Challenge. The GVQA task demands robust multimodal models capable of complex reasoning over video content, grounding the resulting answers visually, and tracking the referenced objects temporally. To achieve this capability, our proposed approach decomposes the GVQA task into a three-stage pipeline: (1) Video Reasoning \\& QA, (2) Spatio-temporal Grounding and (3) Tracking. Our key contribution is the introduction of a trigger moment, derived from our proposed CORTEX prompt, which pinpoints the single most visible frame of a target object to serve as a robust anchor for grounding and tracking. To this end, we achieve the HOTA score of 0.4968, which marks a significant improvement over the previous year's winning score of 0.2704 on GVQA task.",

        "abstract": "Accurate detection of retinal vessels plays a critical role in reflecting a wide range of health status indicators in the clinical diagnosis of ocular diseases. Recently, advances in deep learning have led to a surge in retinal vessel segmentation methods, which have significantly contributed to the quantitative analysis of vascular morphology. However, retinal vasculature differs significantly from conventional segmentation targets in that it consists of extremely thin and branching structures, whose global morphology varies greatly across images. These characteristics continue to pose challenges to segmentation precision and robustness. To address these issues, we propose MM-UNet, a novel architecture tailored for efficient retinal vessel segmentation. The model incorporates Morph Mamba Convolution layers, which replace pointwise convolutions to enhance branching topological perception through morph, state-aware feature sampling. Additionally, Reverse Selective State Guidance modules integrate reverse guidance theory with state-space modeling to improve geometric boundary awareness and decoding efficiency. Extensive experiments conducted on two public retinal vessel segmentation datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method in segmentation accuracy. Compared to the existing approaches, MM-UNet achieves F1-score gains of 1.64 $\\%$ on DRIVE and 1.25 $\\%$ on STARE, demonstrating its effectiveness and advancement.

        "abstract": "Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis heavily relies on amyloid-beta positron emission tomography (Abeta-PET), which is limited by high cost and limited accessibility. This study explores whether Abeta-PET spatial patterns can be predicted from blood-based biomarkers (BBMs) and MRI scans. Methods: We collected Abeta-PET images, T1-weighted MRI scans, and BBMs from 566 participants. A language-enhanced generative model, driven by a large language model (LLM) and multimodal information fusion, was developed to synthesize PET images. Synthesized images were evaluated for image quality, diagnostic consistency, and clinical applicability within a fully automated diagnostic pipeline. Findings: The synthetic PET images closely resemble real PET scans in both structural details (SSIM = 0.920 +/- 0.003) and regional patterns (Pearson's r = 0.955 +/- 0.007). Diagnostic outcomes using synthetic PET show high agreement with real PET-based diagnoses (accuracy = 0.80). Using synthetic PET, we developed a fully automatic AD diagnostic pipeline integrating PET synthesis and classification. The synthetic PET-based model (AUC = 0.78) outperforms T1-based (AUC = 0.68) and BBM-based (AUC = 0.73) models, while combining synthetic PET and BBMs further improved performance (AUC = 0.79). Ablation analysis supports the advantages of LLM integration and prompt engineering. Interpretation: Our language-enhanced generative model synthesizes realistic PET images, enhancing the utility of MRI and BBMs for Abeta spatial pattern assessment and improving the diagnostic workflow for Alzheimer's disease.",

        "abstract": "Strawberries are among the most economically significant fruits in the United States, generating over $2 billion in annual farm-gate sales and accounting for approximately 13% of the total fruit production value. Plant phenotyping plays a vital role in selecting superior cultivars by characterizing plant traits such as morphology, canopy structure, and growth dynamics. However, traditional plant phenotyping methods are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and often destructive. Recently, neural rendering techniques, notably Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have emerged as powerful frameworks for high-fidelity 3D reconstruction. By capturing a sequence of multi-view images or videos around a target plant, these methods enable non-destructive reconstruction of complex plant architectures. Despite their promise, most current applications of 3DGS in agricultural domains reconstruct the entire scene, including background elements, which introduces noise, increases computational costs, and complicates downstream trait analysis. To address this limitation, we propose a novel object-centric 3D reconstruction framework incorporating a preprocessing pipeline that leverages the Segment Anything Model v2 (SAM-2) and alpha channel background masking to achieve clean strawberry plant reconstructions. This approach produces more accurate geometric representations while substantially reducing computational time. With a background-free reconstruction, our algorithm can automatically estimate important plant traits, such as plant height and canopy width, using DBSCAN clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Experimental results show that our method outperforms conventional pipelines in both accuracy and efficiency, offering a scalable and non-destructive solution for strawberry plant phenotyping.",

        "abstract": "Segmental longitudinal strain (SLS) of the left ventricle (LV) is an important prognostic indicator for evaluating regional LV dysfunction, in particular for diagnosing and managing myocardial ischemia. Current techniques for strain estimation require significant manual intervention and expertise, limiting their efficiency and making them too resource-intensive for monitoring purposes. This study introduces the first automated pipeline, autoStrain, for SLS estimation in transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) using deep learning (DL) methods for motion estimation. We present a comparative analysis of two DL approaches: TeeFlow, based on the RAFT optical flow model for dense frame-to-frame predictions, and TeeTracker, based on the CoTracker point trajectory model for sparse long-sequence predictions. As ground truth motion data from real echocardiographic sequences are hardly accessible, we took advantage of a unique simulation pipeline (SIMUS) to generate a highly realistic synthetic TEE (synTEE) dataset of 80 patients with ground truth myocardial motion to train and evaluate both models. Our evaluation shows that TeeTracker outperforms TeeFlow in accuracy, achieving a mean distance error in motion estimation of 0.65 mm on a synTEE test dataset. Clinical validation on 16 patients further demonstrated that SLS estimation with our autoStrain pipeline aligned with clinical references, achieving a mean difference (95\\% limits of agreement) of 1.09% (-8.90% to 11.09%). Incorporation of simulated ischemia in the synTEE data improved the accuracy of the models in quantifying abnormal deformation. Our findings indicate that integrating AI-driven motion estimation with TEE can significantly enhance the precision and efficiency of cardiac function assessment in clinical settings.",

        "abstract": "Mobile sensing systems have long faced a fundamental trade-off between sensing quality and efficiency due to constraints in computation, power, and other limitations. Sparse sensing, which aims to acquire and process only a subset of sensor data, has been a key strategy for maintaining performance under such constraints. However, existing sparse sensing methods often suffer from reduced accuracy, as missing information across space and time introduces uncertainty into many sensing systems. In this work, we investigate whether foundation models can change the landscape of mobile sparse sensing. Using real-world mobile AR data, our evaluations demonstrate that foundation models offer significant improvements in geometry-aware image warping, a central technique for enabling accurate reuse of cross-frame information. Furthermore, our study demonstrates the scalability of foundation model-based sparse sensing and shows its leading performance in 3D scene reconstruction. Collectively, our study reveals critical aspects of the promises and the open challenges of integrating foundation models into mobile sparse sensing systems.",

        "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia, and its early diagnosis is essential for slowing disease progression. Recent studies on multimodal neuroimaging fusion using MRI and PET have achieved promising results by integrating multi-scale complementary features. However, most existing approaches primarily emphasize cross-modal complementarity while overlooking the diagnostic importance of modality-specific features. In addition, the inherent distributional differences between modalities often lead to biased and noisy representations, degrading classification performance. To address these challenges, we propose a Collaborative Attention and Consistent-Guided Fusion framework for MRI and PET based AD diagnosis. The proposed model introduces a learnable parameter representation (LPR) block to compensate for missing modality information, followed by a shared encoder and modality-independent encoders to preserve both shared and specific representations. Furthermore, a consistency-guided mechanism is employed to explicitly align the latent distributions across modalities. Experimental results on the ADNI dataset demonstrate that our method achieves superior diagnostic performance compared with existing fusion strategies.",

        "abstract": "Monocular depth estimation (MDE) is a critical task to guide autonomous medical robots. However, obtaining absolute (metric) depth from an endoscopy camera in surgical scenes is difficult, which limits supervised learning of depth on real endoscopic images. Current image-level unsupervised domain adaptation methods translate synthetic images with known depth maps into the style of real endoscopic frames and train depth networks using these translated images with their corresponding depth maps. However a domain gap often remains between real and translated synthetic images. In this paper, we present a latent feature alignment method to improve absolute depth estimation by reducing this domain gap in the context of endoscopic videos of the central airway. Our methods are agnostic to the image translation process and focus on the depth estimation itself. Specifically, the depth network takes translated synthetic and real endoscopic frames as input and learns latent domain-invariant features via adversarial learning and directional feature consistency. The evaluation is conducted on endoscopic videos of central airway phantoms with manually aligned absolute depth maps. Compared to state-of-the-art MDE methods, our approach achieves superior performance on both absolute and relative depth metrics, and consistently improves results across various backbones and pretrained weights.

Previous work only addresses single challenges, while this paper tackles all three via a novel hierarchical task decomposition approach, proposing the HTSC-CIF framework. HTSC-CIF classifies the three challenges into low-, mid-, and high-level tasks: 1) Low-level: align medical entity features with spatial locations to enhance domain knowledge for visual encoders; 2) Mid-level: use Prefix Language Modeling (text) and Masked Image Modeling (images) to boost cross-modal alignment via mutual guidance; 3) High-level: a cross-modal causal intervention module (via front-door intervention) to reduce confounders and improve interpretability. Extensive experiments confirm HTSC-CIF's effectiveness, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) MRG methods. Code will be made public upon paper acceptance.",

With this paper, we explore the usefulness of using the well-known Euler angles parameterisation as a basis for a Normalizing Flows model for pose estimation. Isomorphic to spatial rotation, 3D pose has been parameterized in a number of ways, either in or out of the context of parameter estimation.

Existing approaches are limited by outcome-only supervision, which rewards correct answers without ensuring sound reasoning, and by uniform thinking strategies, which often lead to overthinking on simple tasks and underthinking on complex ones. SAIL-RL addresses these challenges with a dual reward system: the Thinking Reward, which evaluates reasoning quality through factual grounding, logical coherence, and answer consistency, and the Judging Reward, which adaptively determines whether deep reasoning or direct answering is appropriate. Experiments on the state-of-the-art SAIL-VL2 show that SAIL-RL improves reasoning and multimodal understanding benchmarks at both 4B and 8B scales, achieving competitive performance against commercial closed-source models such as GPT-4o, and substantially reduces hallucinations, establishing it as a principled framework for building more reliable and adaptive MLLMs. The code will be available at this https URL.",

Our core innovation is a location solver that adapts message-passing least squares (MPLS) -- originally developed for group synchronization -- to camera location estimation. We modify MPLS to emphasize cycle-consistent information, redefine cycle consistencies using estimated distances from previous iterations, and incorporate a Welsch-type robust loss. We establish the strongest known deterministic exact-recovery guarantee for camera location estimation, showing that cycle consistency alone -- without access to inter-camera distances -- suffices to achieve the lowest sample complexity currently known. To further enhance robustness, we introduce a plug-and-play outlier rejection module inspired by robust subspace recovery, and we fully integrate cycle consistency into MPLS for rotation synchronization. Our global approach avoids the need for bundle adjustment. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets show that Cycle-Sync consistently outperforms leading pose estimators, including full structure-from-motion pipelines with bundle adjustment.",

Existing post-hoc OOD detection methods detect OOD samples by leveraging their features and logits information without retraining. However, they often overlook the inherent correlation between features and logits, which is crucial for effective OOD detection. To address this limitation, we propose Global-Aware Feature Decoupling with Confidence Calibration (GAFD-CC). GAFD-CC aims to refine decision boundaries and increase discriminative performance. Firstly, it performs global-aware feature decoupling guided by classification weights. This involves aligning features with the direction of global classification weights to decouple them. From this, GAFD-CC extracts two types of critical information: positively correlated features that promote in-distribution (ID)/OOD boundary refinement and negatively correlated features that suppress false positives and tighten these boundaries. Secondly, it adaptively fuses these decoupled features with multi-scale logit-based confidence for comprehensive and robust OOD detection. Extensive experiments on large-scale benchmarks demonstrate GAFD-CC's competitive performance and strong generalization ability compared to those of state-of-the-art methods.",

However, contemporary Vision-Language Models (VLMs) remain constrained to reasoning within the discrete and rigid space of linguistic tokens, thereby bottlenecking the rich, high-dimensional nature of visual perception. To bridge this gap, we propose CoCoVa (Chain of Continuous Vision-Language Thought), a novel framework for vision-language model that leverages continuous cross-modal reasoning for diverse vision-language tasks. The core of CoCoVa is an iterative reasoning cycle, where a novel Latent Q-Former (LQ-Former) acts as a dynamic reasoning engine, iteratively refining a chain of latent thought vectors through cross-modal fusion. To focus this process, a token selection mechanism dynamically identifies salient visual regions, mimicking attentional focus. To ensure these latent thoughts remain grounded, we train the model with a multi-task objective that combines contrastive learning and diffusion-based reconstruction, enforcing alignment between latent representations and both visual and textual modalities. Evaluations show CoCoVa improves accuracy and token efficiency over strong baselines. With a 1.5B backbone, it competes with or surpasses larger 7B-9B models on almost all benchmarks. When scaled to 7B LLM backbones, it remains competitive with state-of-the-art models. Qualitative analysis validates that learned latent space captures interpretable and structured reasoning patterns, highlighting the potential of CoCoVa to bridge the representational gap between discrete language processing and the continuous nature of visual understanding.",

However, existing chemical reaction data often exist as images within papers, making them not machine-readable and unusable for training machine learning models. In response to this challenge, we propose the RxnCaption framework for the task of chemical Reaction Diagram Parsing (RxnDP). Our framework reformulates the traditional coordinate prediction driven parsing process into an image captioning problem, which Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) handle naturally. We introduce a strategy termed \"BBox and Index as Visual Prompt\" (BIVP), which uses our state-of-the-art molecular detector, MolYOLO, to pre-draw molecular bounding boxes and indices directly onto the input image. This turns the downstream parsing into a natural-language description problem. Extensive experiments show that the BIVP strategy significantly improves structural extraction quality while simplifying model design. We further construct the RxnCaption-11k dataset, an order of magnitude larger than prior real-world literature benchmarks, with a balanced test subset across four layout archetypes. Experiments demonstrate that RxnCaption-VL achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple metrics. We believe our method, dataset, and models will advance structured information extraction from chemical literature and catalyze broader AI applications in chemistry.

While the segmentation of camera or LiDAR data is widely researched and achieves great results, it often introduces an increased latency by requiring the accumulation of temporal sequences to gain the necessary temporal context. Radar sensors overcome this problem with their ability to provide a direct measurement of a point's Doppler velocity, which can be exploited for single-scan moving object segmentation. However, radar point clouds are often sparse and noisy, making data annotation for use in supervised learning very tedious, time-consuming, and cost-intensive. To overcome this problem, we address the task of self-supervised moving object segmentation of sparse and noisy radar point clouds. We follow a two-step approach of contrastive self-supervised representation learning with subsequent supervised fine-tuning using limited amounts of annotated data. We propose a novel clustering-based contrastive loss function with cluster refinement based on dynamic points removal to pretrain the network to produce motion-aware representations of the radar data. Our method improves label efficiency after fine-tuning, effectively boosting state-of-the-art performance by self-supervised pretraining.",

In the past, most previous color correction methods aimed at correcting color for color images. The purpose of this paper is to propose a grouping-based hybrid color correction algorithm for color point clouds. Our algorithm begins by estimating the overlapping rate between the aligned source and target point clouds, and then adaptively partitions the target points into two groups, namely the close proximity group Gcl and the moderate proximity group Gmod, or three groups, namely Gcl, Gmod, and the distant proximity group Gdist, when the estimated overlapping rate is low or high, respectively. To correct color for target points in Gcl, a K-nearest neighbors based bilateral interpolation (KBI) method is proposed. To correct color for target points in Gmod, a joint KBI and the histogram equalization (JKHE) method is proposed. For target points in Gdist, a histogram equalization (HE) method is proposed for color correction. Finally, we discuss the grouping-effect free property and the ablation study in our algorithm. The desired color consistency correction benefit of our algorithm has been justified through 1086 testing color point cloud pairs against the state-of-the-art methods.

Most notably, Felis Catus (domestic cats) have vertically elongated pupils linked to ambush predation; yet, how such specializations manifest in downstream visual representations remains incompletely understood. We present a unified, frozen-encoder benchmark that quantifies feline-human cross-species representational alignment in the wild, across convolutional networks, supervised Vision Transformers, windowed transformers, and self-supervised ViTs (DINO), using layer-wise Centered Kernel Alignment (linear and RBF) and Representational Similarity Analysis, with additional distributional and stability tests reported in the paper. Across models, DINO ViT-B/16 attains the most substantial alignment (mean CKA-RBF $\\approx0.814$, mean CKA-linear $\\approx0.745$, mean RSA $\\approx0.698$), peaking at early blocks, indicating that token-level self-supervision induces early-stage features that bridge species-specific statistics. Supervised ViTs are competitive on CKA yet show weaker geometric correspondence than DINO (e.g., ViT-B/16 RSA $\\approx0.53$ at block8; ViT-L/16 $\\approx0.47$ at block14), revealing depth-dependent divergences between similarity and representational geometry. CNNs remain strong baselines but below plain ViTs on alignment, and windowed transformers underperform plain ViTs, implicating architectural inductive biases in cross-species alignment. Results indicate that self-supervision coupled with ViT inductive biases yields representational geometries that more closely align feline and human visual systems than widely used CNNs and windowed Transformers, providing testable neuroscientific hypotheses about where and how cross-species visual computations converge.

        "abstract": "Video Understanding, Scene Interpretation and Commonsense Reasoning are highly challenging tasks enabling the interpretation of visual information, allowing agents to perceive, interact with and make rational decisions in its environment. Large Language Models (LLMs) and Visual Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable advancements in these areas in recent years, enabling domain-specific applications as well as zero-shot open vocabulary tasks, combining multiple domains. However, the required computational complexity poses challenges for their application on edge devices and in the context of Mobile Robotics, especially considering the trade-off between accuracy and inference time. In this paper, we investigate the capabilities of state-of-the-art VLMs for the task of Scene Interpretation and Action Recognition, with special regard to small VLMs capable of being deployed to edge devices in the context of Mobile Robotics. The proposed pipeline is evaluated on a diverse dataset consisting of various real-world cityscape, on-campus and indoor scenarios. The experimental evaluation discusses the potential of these small models on edge devices, with particular emphasis on challenges, weaknesses, inherent model biases and the application of the gained information.

In this paper, we propose KAO, a novel framework that utilizes Kernel-Adaptive Optimization within diffusion models for satellite image inpainting. KAO is specifically designed to address the challenges posed by very high-resolution (VHR) satellite datasets, such as DeepGlobe and the Massachusetts Roads Dataset. Unlike existing methods that rely on preconditioned models requiring extensive retraining or postconditioned models with significant computational overhead, KAO introduces a Latent Space Conditioning approach, optimizing a compact latent space to achieve efficient and accurate inpainting. Furthermore, we incorporate Explicit Propagation into the diffusion process, facilitating forward-backward fusion, which improves the stability and precision of the method. Experimental results demonstrate that KAO sets a new benchmark for VHR satellite image restoration, providing a scalable, high-performance solution that balances the efficiency of preconditioned models with the flexibility of postconditioned models.",

        "abstract": "Multi-view action recognition aims to recognize human actions using multiple camera views and deals with occlusion caused by obstacles or crowds. In this task, cooperation among views, which generates a joint representation by combining multiple views, is vital. Previous studies have explored promising cooperation methods for improving performance. However, since their methods focus only on the task setting of recognizing a single action from an entire video, they are not applicable to the recently popular spatio-temporal action recognition~(STAR) setting, in which each person's action is recognized sequentially. To address this problem, this paper proposes a multi-view action recognition method for the STAR setting, called MVAFormer. In MVAFormer, we introduce a novel transformer-based cooperation module among views. In contrast to previous studies, which utilize embedding vectors with lost spatial information, our module utilizes the feature map for effective cooperation in the STAR setting, which preserves the spatial information. Furthermore, in our module, we divide the self-attention for the same and different views to model the relationship between multiple views effectively. The results of experiments using a newly collected dataset demonstrate that MVAFormer outperforms the comparison baselines by approximately $4.4$ points on the F-measure.",

While recent advances in object-centric inverse rendering, novel view synthesis and relighting have shown promising results, most techniques still heavily rely on the synthetic datasets for training and small-scale real-world datasets for benchmarking, which limits their realism and generalization. To address this gap, OLATverse offers two key advantages over existing datasets: large-scale coverage of real objects and high-fidelity appearance under precisely controlled illuminations. Specifically, OLATverse contains 765 common and uncommon real-world objects, spanning a wide range of material categories. Each object is captured using 35 DSLR cameras and 331 individually controlled light sources, enabling the simulation of diverse illumination conditions. In addition, for each object, we provide well-calibrated camera parameters, accurate object masks, photometric surface normals, and diffuse albedo as auxiliary resources. We also construct an extensive evaluation set, establishing the first comprehensive real-world object-centric benchmark for inverse rendering and normal estimation. We believe that OLATverse represents a pivotal step toward integrating the next generation of inverse rendering and relighting methods with real-world data.

        "abstract": "With the rapid growth of the low-altitude economy, UAVs have become crucial for measurement and tracking in patrol systems. However, in GNSS-denied areas, satellite-based localization methods are prone to failure. This paper presents a cross-view UAV localization framework that performs map matching via object detection, aimed at effectively addressing cross-temporal, cross-view, heterogeneous aerial image matching. In typical pipelines, UAV visual localization is formulated as an image-retrieval problem: features are extracted to build a localization map, and the pose of a query image is estimated by matching it to a reference database with known poses. Because publicly available UAV localization datasets are limited, many approaches recast localization as a classification task and rely on scene labels in these datasets to ensure accuracy. Other methods seek to reduce cross-domain differences using polar-coordinate reprojection, perspective transformations, or generative adversarial networks; however, they can suffer from misalignment, content loss, and limited realism. In contrast, we leverage modern object detection to accurately extract salient instances from UAV and satellite images, and integrate a graph neural network to reason about inter-image and intra-image node relationships. Using a fine-grained, graph-based node-similarity metric, our method achieves strong retrieval and localization performance. Extensive experiments on public and real-world datasets show that our approach handles heterogeneous appearance differences effectively and generalizes well, making it applicable to scenarios with larger modality gaps, such as infrared-visible image matching.

However, adapting these general-purpose models for specialized scientific tasks is critical, and the optimal domain adaptation strategy is often unclear. To address this, we introduce PtychoBench, a new multi-modal, multi-task benchmark for ptychographic analysis. Using this benchmark, we systematically compare two specialization strategies: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and In-Context Learning (ICL). We evaluate these strategies on a visual artifact detection task with VLMs and a textual parameter recommendation task with LLMs in a data-scarce regime. Our findings reveal that the optimal specialization pathway is task-dependent. For the visual task, SFT and ICL are highly complementary, with a fine-tuned model guided by context-aware examples achieving the highest mean performance (Micro-F1 of 0.728). Conversely, for the textual task, ICL on a large base model is the superior strategy, reaching a peak Micro-F1 of 0.847 and outperforming a powerful \"super-expert\" SFT model (0-shot Micro-F1 of 0.839). We also confirm the superiority of context-aware prompting and identify a consistent contextual interference phenomenon in fine-tuned models. These results, benchmarked against strong baselines including GPT-4o and a DINOv3-based classifier, offer key observations for AI in science: the optimal specialization path in our benchmark is dependent on the task modality, offering a clear framework for developing more effective science-based agentic systems.",

Specifically, we first perform visual-semantic matching between the script generated by a large language model and a video library to obtain subsets of candidate shots aligned with the script semantics. Next, we segment and label the shots from reference videos, extracting attributes such as shot size, camera motion, and semantics. We then employ energy-based models to learn from these attributes, scoring candidate shot sequences based on their alignment with reference styles. Finally, we achieve shot assembly optimization by combining multiple syntax rules, producing videos that align with the assembly style of the reference videos. Our method not only automates the arrangement and combination of independent shots according to specific logic, narrative requirements, or artistic styles but also learns the assembly style of reference videos, creating a coherent visual sequence or holistic visual expression.

        "abstract": "Shearography is a non-destructive testing method for detecting subsurface defects, offering high sensitivity and full-field inspection capabilities. However, its industrial adoption remains limited due to the need for expert interpretation. To reduce reliance on labeled data and manual evaluation, this study explores unsupervised learning methods for automated anomaly detection in shearographic images. Three architectures are evaluated: a fully connected autoencoder, a convolutional autoencoder, and a student-teacher feature matching model. All models are trained solely on defect-free data. A controlled dataset was developed using a custom specimen with reproducible defect patterns, enabling systematic acquisition of shearographic measurements under both ideal and realistic deformation conditions. Two training subsets were defined: one containing only undistorted, defect-free samples, and one additionally including globally deformed, yet defect-free, data. The latter simulates practical inspection conditions by incorporating deformation-induced fringe patterns that may obscure localized anomalies. The models are evaluated in terms of binary classification and, for the student-teacher model, spatial defect localization. Results show that the student-teacher approach achieves superior classification robustness and enables precise localization. Compared to the autoencoder-based models, it demonstrates improved separability of feature representations, as visualized through t-SNE embeddings. Additionally, a YOLOv8 model trained on labeled defect data serves as a reference to benchmark localization quality. This study underscores the potential of unsupervised deep learning for scalable, label-efficient shearographic inspection in industrial environments.",

        "abstract": "This report describes the UVH-26 dataset, the first public release by AIM@IISc of a large-scale dataset of annotated traffic-camera images from India. The dataset comprises 26,646 high-resolution (1080p) images sampled from 2800 Bengaluru's Safe-City CCTV cameras over a 4-week period, and subsequently annotated through a crowdsourced hackathon involving 565 college students from across India. In total, 1.8 million bounding boxes were labeled across 14 vehicle classes specific to India: Cycle, 2-Wheeler (Motorcycle), 3-Wheeler (Auto-rickshaw), LCV (Light Commercial Vehicles), Van, Tempo-traveller, Hatchback, Sedan, SUV, MUV, Mini-bus, Bus, Truck and Other. Of these, 283k-316k consensus ground truth bounding boxes and labels were derived for distinct objects in the 26k images using Majority Voting and STAPLE algorithms. Further, we train multiple contemporary detectors, including YOLO11-S/X, RT-DETR-S/X, and DAMO-YOLO-T/L using these datasets, and report accuracy based on mAP50, mAP75 and mAP50:95. Models trained on UVH-26 achieve 8.4-31.5% improvements in mAP50:95 over equivalent baseline models trained on COCO dataset, with RT-DETR-X showing the best performance at 0.67 (mAP50:95) as compared to 0.40 for COCO-trained weights for common classes (Car, Bus, and Truck). This demonstrates the benefits of domain-specific training data for Indian traffic scenarios. The release package provides the 26k images with consensus annotations based on Majority Voting (UVH-26-MV) and STAPLE (UVH-26-ST) and the 6 fine-tuned YOLO and DETR models on each of these datasets. By capturing the heterogeneity of Indian urban mobility directly from operational traffic-camera streams, UVH-26 addresses a critical gap in existing global benchmarks, and offers a foundation for advancing detection, classification, and deployment of intelligent transportation systems in emerging nations with complex traffic conditions.",

To address these challenges, we propose MTF-CVReID, a parameter-efficient framework that introduces seven complementary modules over a ViT-B/16 backbone. Specifically, we include: (1) Cross-Stream Feature Normalization (CSFN) to correct camera and view biases; (2) Multi-Resolution Feature Harmonization (MRFH) for scale stabilization across altitudes; (3) Identity-Aware Memory Module (IAMM) to reinforce persistent identity traits; (4) Temporal Dynamics Modeling (TDM) for motion-aware short-term temporal encoding; (5) Inter-View Feature Alignment (IVFA) for perspective-invariant representation alignment; (6) Hierarchical Temporal Pattern Learning (HTPL) to capture multi-scale temporal regularities; and (7) Multi-View Identity Consistency Learning (MVICL) that enforces cross-view identity coherence using a contrastive learning paradigm. Despite adding only about 2 million parameters and 0.7 GFLOPs over the baseline, MTF-CVReID maintains real-time efficiency (189 FPS) and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the AG-VPReID benchmark across all altitude levels, with strong cross-dataset generalization to G2A-VReID and MARS datasets. These results show that carefully designed adapter-based modules can substantially enhance cross-view robustness and temporal consistency without compromising computational efficiency.

In this work, we propose Visual Cortex Flow Architecture (VCFlow), a novel hierarchical decoding framework that explicitly models the ventral-dorsal architecture of the human visual system to learn multi-dimensional representations. By disentangling and leveraging features from early visual cortex, ventral, and dorsal streams, VCFlow captures diverse and complementary cognitive information essential for visual reconstruction. Furthermore, we introduce a feature-level contrastive learning strategy to enhance the extraction of subject-invariant semantic representations, thereby enhancing subject-agnostic applicability to previously unseen subjects. Unlike conventional pipelines that need more than 12 hours of per-subject data and heavy computation, VCFlow sacrifices only 7\\% accuracy on average yet generates each reconstructed video in 10 seconds without any retraining, offering a fast and clinically scalable solution.

Existing solutions either rely on fine-tuning with large, inaccessible datasets or are training-free yet limited to generating isolated foreground elements, failing to produce a complete and coherent scene. To address this, we introduce the Training-free Noise Transplantation and Cultivation Diffusion Model (TAUE), a novel framework for zero-shot, layer-wise image generation. Our core technique, Noise Transplantation and Cultivation (NTC), extracts intermediate latent representations from both foreground and composite generation processes, transplanting them into the initial noise for subsequent layers. This ensures semantic and structural coherence across foreground, background, and composite layers, enabling consistent, multi-layered outputs without requiring fine-tuning or auxiliary datasets. Extensive experiments show that our training-free method achieves performance comparable to fine-tuned methods, enhancing layer-wise consistency while maintaining high image quality and fidelity. TAUE not only eliminates costly training and dataset requirements but also unlocks novel downstream applications, such as complex compositional editing, paving the way for more accessible and controllable generative workflows.",

        "abstract": "Change detection (CD) is a fundamental task for monitoring and analyzing land cover dynamics. While recent high performance models and high quality datasets have significantly advanced the field, a critical limitation persists. Current models typically acquire limited knowledge from single-type annotated data and cannot concurrently leverage diverse binary change detection (BCD) and semantic change detection (SCD) datasets. This constraint leads to poor generalization and limited versatility. The recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) introduce new possibilities for a unified CD framework. We leverage the language priors and unification capabilities of MLLMs to develop UniChange, the first MLLM-based unified change detection model. UniChange integrates generative language abilities with specialized CD functionalities. Our model successfully unifies both BCD and SCD tasks through the introduction of three special tokens: [T1], [T2], and [CHANGE]. Furthermore, UniChange utilizes text prompts to guide the identification of change categories, eliminating the reliance on predefined classification heads. This design allows UniChange to effectively acquire knowledge from multi-source datasets, even when their class definitions conflict. Experiments on four public benchmarks (WHU-CD, S2Looking, LEVIR-CD+, and SECOND) demonstrate SOTA performance, achieving IoU scores of 90.41, 53.04, 78.87, and 57.62, respectively, surpassing all previous methods.

Beyond task accuracy, it incorporates system-level metrics such as runtime and prefilling latency to provide a holistic view. Our experiments uncover several key findings: (1) random pruning is a surprisingly strong baseline, (2) no single method consistently outperforms others across scenarios, (3) pruning sensitivity varies significantly across tasks, with OCR being most vulnerable, and (4) pruning ratio is the dominant factor governing performance degradation.

However, a substantial gap inherently exists between these two modalities. Besides, existing methods primarily rely on intermediate representations to align cross-modal features of the same person. The intermediate feature representations are usually create by generating intermediate images (kind of data enhancement), or fusing intermediate features (more parameters, lack of interpretability), and they do not make good use of the intermediate features. Thus, we propose a novel VI-ReID framework via Modality-Transition Representation Learning (MTRL) with a middle generated image as a transmitter from visible to infrared modals, which are fully aligned with the original visible images and similar to the infrared modality. After that, using a modality-transition contrastive loss and a modality-query regularization loss for training, which could align the cross-modal features more effectively.

While advanced methods have made progress in video emotion analysis, the intrinsic nature of emotions poses significant challenges. Emotions are characterized by dynamic and cues-dependent properties, making it difficult to understand complex and evolving emotional states with reasonable rationale. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel affective cues-guided reasoning framework that unifies fundamental attribute perception, expression analysis, and high-level emotional understanding in a stage-wise manner. At the core of our approach is a family of video emotion foundation models (VidEmo), specifically designed for emotion reasoning and instruction-following. These models undergo a two-stage tuning process: first, curriculum emotion learning for injecting emotion knowledge, followed by affective-tree reinforcement learning for emotion reasoning. Moreover, we establish a foundational data infrastructure and introduce a emotion-centric fine-grained dataset (Emo-CFG) consisting of 2.1M diverse instruction-based samples. Emo-CFG includes explainable emotional question-answering, fine-grained captions, and associated rationales, providing essential resources for advancing emotion understanding tasks.

        "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) underpin many modern computer vision systems. With applications ranging from common to critical areas, a need to explain and understand the model and its decisions (XAI) emerged. Prior works suggest that in the top layers of CNNs, the individual channels can be attributed to classifying human-understandable concepts. Concept relevance propagation (CRP) methods can backtrack predictions to these channels and find images that most activate these channels. However, current CRP workflows are largely manual: experts must inspect activation images to name the discovered concepts and must synthesize verbose explanations from relevance maps, limiting the accessibility of the explanations and their scalability. To address these issues, we introduce Large Language model EXplaIns COncept Relevance Propagation (LLEXICORP), a modular pipeline that couples CRP with a multimodal large language model. Our approach automatically assigns descriptive names to concept prototypes and generates natural-language explanations that translate quantitative relevance distributions into intuitive narratives. To ensure faithfulness, we craft prompts that teach the language model the semantics of CRP through examples and enforce a separation between naming and explanation tasks. The resulting text can be tailored to different audiences, offering low-level technical descriptions for experts and high-level summaries for non-technical stakeholders. We qualitatively evaluate our method on various images from ImageNet on a VGG16 model. Our findings suggest that integrating concept-based attribution methods with large language models can significantly lower the barrier to interpreting deep neural networks, paving the way for more transparent AI systems.",

        "abstract": "The alignment of representations from different modalities has recently been shown to provide insights on the structural similarities and downstream capabilities of different encoders across diverse data types. While significant progress has been made in aligning images with text, the temporal nature of video data remains largely unexplored in this context. In this work, we conduct the first comprehensive study of video-text representation alignment, probing the capabilities of modern video and language encoders. Our findings reveal several key insights. First, we demonstrate that cross-modal alignment highly depends on the richness of both visual (static images vs. multi-frame videos) and text (single caption vs. a collection) data provided at test time, especially when using state-of-the-art video encoders. We propose parametric test-time scaling laws that capture this behavior and show remarkable predictive power against empirical observations. Secondly, we investigate the correlation between semantic alignment and performance on both semantic and non-semantic downstream tasks, providing initial evidence that strong alignment against text encoders may be linked to general-purpose video representation and understanding. Finally, we correlate temporal reasoning with cross-modal alignment providing a challenging test-bed for vision and language models. Overall, our work introduces video-text alignment as an informative zero-shot way to probe the representation power of different encoders for spatio-temporal data.

We develop a unified base model for reconstructing view-consistent 3D heads from a single input image. The model employs a dual-branch encoder followed by a ViT-based decoder that lifts 2D features into 3D space through iterative cross-attention. Rendering is performed using Gaussian Splatting. At the heart of our approach is a novel perceptual supervision strategy based on DINOv2 and SAM2.1, which provides rich, generalized signals for both geometric and appearance fidelity. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in novel-view synthesis and, furthermore, exhibits exceptional robustness to extreme viewing angles compared to established baselines. Furthermore, this base model can be seamlessly extended for semantic 3D editing by swapping the encoder and finetuning the network. In this variant, we disentangle geometry and style through two distinct input modalities: a segmentation map to control geometry and either a text prompt or a reference image to specify appearance. We highlight the intuitive and powerful 3D editing capabilities of our model through a lightweight, interactive GUI, where users can effortlessly sculpt geometry by drawing segmentation maps and stylize appearance via natural language or image prompts.

        "abstract": "Code has emerged as a precise and executable medium for reasoning and action in the agent era. Yet, progress has largely focused on language-centric tasks such as program synthesis and debugging, leaving visual-centric coding underexplored. Inspired by how humans reason over sketches, we advocate SVG code as a compact, interpretable, and executable visual representation. We introduce VCode, a benchmark that reframes multimodal understanding as code generation: given an image, a model must produce SVG that preserves symbolic meaning for downstream reasoning. VCode covers three domains - general commonsense (MM-Vet), professional disciplines (MMMU), and visual-centric perception (CV-Bench). To assess symbolic fidelity, we propose CodeVQA, a novel evaluation protocol in which a policy model answers questions over rendered SVGs; correct answers indicate faithful symbolic preservation. Empirically, frontier VLMs struggle to generate faithful SVGs, revealing a persistent gap between language-centric and visual-centric coding. To close this gap, we introduce VCoder, an agentic framework that augments VLMs along two axes: (i) Thinking with Revision, which iteratively analyzes discrepancies and refines SVG code; and (ii) Acting with Visual Tools, where detectors and parsers supply structured cues such as objects, shapes, and text beyond the model's intrinsic capacity. Across benchmarks, frontier VLMs with strong reasoning capabilities score well overall yet remain limited in professional knowledge and 3D reasoning. VCoder delivers a 12.3-point overall gain over the top-performing Claude-4-Opus. Human studies show that both humans and VLMs perform worse on rendered SVGs, their consistency reveals the promise of symbolic visual representation.

        "abstract": "We propose MIRA, a new benchmark designed to evaluate models in scenarios where generating intermediate visual images is essential for successful reasoning. Unlike traditional CoT methods that rely solely on text, tasks in MIRA require models to generate and utilize intermediate images - such as sketches, structural diagrams, or path drawings - to guide their reasoning process. This setup closely mirrors how humans solve complex problems through \"drawing to think\". To solve this, MIRA focuses on tasks that are intrinsically challenging and involve complex structures, spatial relationships, or reasoning steps that are difficult to express through language alone. To ensure that our evaluation data is of high-quality, we include 546 multimodal problems, annotated with intermediate visual images and final answers. We also propose a unified evaluation protocol for MIRA that spans three levels of evaluation input: direct input with image and question only, text-only CoT input with image and thinking prompts, and Visual-CoT input with both annotated image clues and textual thinking prompts. To probe the upper bound of model capacity on our benchmark, we also report pass@k and majority voting accuracies under different k settings. Experimental results show that existing multimodal large language models, including strongest private models as well as strong open-weight models, perform poorly when relying solely on textual prompts. However, when intermediate visual cues are provided, model performance improves consistently, yielding an average relative gain of 33.7% across all models and tasks. We also probe the upper bound by expanding the search space and designing textual prompts aligned with Visual-CoT, but both yield only limited improvements compared to our Visual-CoT setting. These results underscore the critical role of imagined visual information in enabling successful reasoning on MIRA.",

        "abstract": "The threats posed by AI-generated media, particularly deepfakes, are now raising significant challenges for multimedia forensics, misinformation detection, and biometric system resulting in erosion of public trust in the legal system, significant increase in frauds, and social engineering attacks. Although several forensic methods have been proposed, they suffer from three critical gaps: (i) use of non-standardized benchmarks with GAN- or diffusion-generated images, (ii) inconsistent training protocols (e.g., scratch, frozen, fine-tuning), and (iii) limited evaluation metrics that fail to capture generalization and explainability. These limitations hinder fair comparison, obscure true robustness, and restrict deployment in security-critical applications. This paper introduces a unified benchmarking framework for systematic evaluation of forensic methods under controlled and reproducible conditions. We benchmark ten SoTA forensic methods (scratch, frozen, and fine-tuned) and seven publicly available datasets (GAN and diffusion) to perform extensive and systematic evaluations. We evaluate performance using multiple metrics, including accuracy, average precision, ROC-AUC, error rate, and class-wise sensitivity. We also further analyze model interpretability using confidence curves and Grad-CAM heatmaps. Our evaluations demonstrate substantial variability in generalization, with certain methods exhibiting strong in-distribution performance but degraded cross-model transferability. This study aims to guide the research community toward a deeper understanding of the strengths and limitations of current forensic approaches, and to inspire the development of more robust, generalizable, and explainable solutions.",

We share two complementary Vision Transformer architectures in the PLUTO-4 family: a compact and efficient PLUTO-4S model optimized for multi-scale deployment using a FlexiViT setup with 2D-RoPE embeddings, and a frontier-scale PLUTO-4G model trained with a single patch size to maximize representation capacity and stability. Both models are pretrained using a self-supervised objective derived from DINOv2 on a large multi-institutional corpus containing 551,164 WSIs from 137,144 patients across over 50 institutions, spanning over 60 disease types and over 100 stains. Comprehensive evaluation across public and internal benchmarks demonstrates that PLUTO-4 achieves state-of-the-art performance on tasks requiring varying spatial and biological context, including patch-level classification, segmentation, and slide-level diagnosis. The compact PLUTO-4S provides high-throughput and robust performance for practical deployment, while PLUTO-4G establishes new performance frontiers across multiple pathology benchmarks, including an 11% improvement in dermatopathology diagnosis. These diverse improvements underscore PLUTO-4's potential to transform real-world applications as a backbone for translational research and diagnostic use cases.",

For a 2D image of a human head, a Vision Transformer network predicts a 3D embedding for each pixel, which corresponds to a location in a 3D canonical unit cube. In order to train our network, we collect a dataset of pairwise point matches, estimated by a state-of-the-art point tracker over a collection of diverse in-the-wild talking heads videos, and guide the mapping via a contrastive loss, encouraging matched points to have close embeddings. We further employ multi-task learning with face landmarks and segmentation constraints, as well as imposing spatial continuity of embeddings through latent cube features, which results in an interpretable and queryable canonical space. The representation can be used for finding common semantic parts, face/head tracking, and stereo reconstruction. Due to the strong supervision, our method is robust to pose variations and covers the entire head, including hair. Additionally, the canonical space bottleneck makes sure the obtained representations are consistent across diverse poses and individuals. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results in geometry-aware point matching and monocular head tracking with 3D Morphable Models. The code and the model checkpoint will be made available to the public.",

        "abstract": "Multimodal spatiotemporal learning on real-world experimental data is constrained by two challenges: within-modality measurements are sparse, irregular, and noisy (QA/QC artifacts) but cross-modally correlated; the set of available modalities varies across space and time, shrinking the usable record unless models can adapt to arbitrary subsets at train and test time. We propose OmniField, a continuity-aware framework that learns a continuous neural field conditioned on available modalities and iteratively fuses cross-modal context. A multimodal crosstalk block architecture paired with iterative cross-modal refinement aligns signals prior to the decoder, enabling unified reconstruction, interpolation, forecasting, and cross-modal prediction without gridding or surrogate preprocessing. Extensive evaluations show that OmniField consistently outperforms eight strong multimodal spatiotemporal baselines. Under heavy simulated sensor noise, performance remains close to clean-input levels, highlighting robustness to corrupted measurements.",

        "abstract": "This study presents a hybrid deep learning framework, the Vision Transformer with Residual Feature Network (VRF-Net), for recovering high-resolution system matrices in Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI). MPI resolution often suffers from downsampling and coil sensitivity variations. VRF-Net addresses these challenges by combining transformer-based global attention with residual convolutional refinement, enabling recovery of both large-scale structures and fine details. To reflect realistic MPI conditions, the system matrix is degraded using a dual-stage downsampling strategy. Training employed paired-image super-resolution on the public Open MPI dataset and a simulated dataset incorporating variable coil sensitivity profiles. For system matrix recovery on the Open MPI dataset, VRF-Net achieved nRMSE = 0.403, pSNR = 39.08 dB, and SSIM = 0.835 at 2x scaling, and maintained strong performance even at challenging scale 8x (pSNR = 31.06 dB, SSIM = 0.717). For the simulated dataset, VRF-Net achieved nRMSE = 4.44, pSNR = 28.52 dB, and SSIM = 0.771 at 2x scaling, with stable performance at higher scales. On average, it reduced nRMSE by 88.2%, increased pSNR by 44.7%, and improved SSIM by 34.3% over interpolation and CNN-based methods. In image reconstruction of Open MPI phantoms, VRF-Net further reduced reconstruction error to nRMSE = 1.79 at 2x scaling, while preserving structural fidelity (pSNR = 41.58 dB, SSIM = 0.960), outperforming existing methods. These findings demonstrate that VRF-Net enables sharper, artifact-free system matrix recovery and robust image reconstruction across multiple scales, offering a promising direction for future in vivo applications.",

Particularly in the field of sensing, 3D point cloud data collected by LiDAR is utilized to run deep neural network models for 3D object detection. However, these state-of-the-art models are complex, leading to longer processing times and increased power consumption on edge devices. The objective of this study is to address these issues by leveraging Split Computing, a distributed machine learning inference method. Split Computing aims to lessen the computational burden on edge devices, thereby reducing processing time and power consumption. Furthermore, it minimizes the risk of data breaches by only transmitting intermediate data from the deep neural network model. Experimental results show that splitting after voxelization reduces the inference time by 70.8% and the edge device execution time by 90.0%. When splitting within the network, the inference time is reduced by up to 57.1%, and the edge device execution time is reduced by up to 69.5%.",

        "abstract": "The development of clinically reliable artificial intelligence (AI) systems for mammography is hindered by profound heterogeneity in data quality, metadata standards, and population distributions across public datasets. This heterogeneity introduces dataset-specific biases that severely compromise the generalizability of the model, a fundamental barrier to clinical deployment. We present MammoClean, a public framework for standardization and bias quantification in mammography datasets. MammoClean standardizes case selection, image processing (including laterality and intensity correction), and unifies metadata into a consistent multi-view structure. We provide a comprehensive review of breast anatomy, imaging characteristics, and public mammography datasets to systematically identify key sources of bias. Applying MammoClean to three heterogeneous datasets (CBIS-DDSM, TOMPEI-CMMD, VinDr-Mammo), we quantify substantial distributional shifts in breast density and abnormality prevalence. Critically, we demonstrate the direct impact of data corruption: AI models trained on corrupted datasets exhibit significant performance degradation compared to their curated counterparts. By using MammoClean to identify and mitigate bias sources, researchers can construct unified multi-dataset training corpora that enable development of robust models with superior cross-domain generalization. MammoClean provides an essential, reproducible pipeline for bias-aware AI development in mammography, facilitating fairer comparisons and advancing the creation of safe, effective systems that perform equitably across diverse patient populations and clinical settings.

Firstly, the Kalman filter is performed for a number of different initial parameter sets providing the system input-parameter-state estimation. Secondly, the resulting posterior distributions are compared simultaneously to the initial prior distributions using the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Finally, the identification with the least Kullback-Leibler divergence is selected as the one with the most plausible results.

        "abstract": "Mobile eye tracking plays a vital role in capturing human visual attention across both real-world and extended reality (XR) environments, making it an essential tool for applications ranging from behavioural research to human-computer interaction. However, missing values due to blinks, pupil detection errors, or illumination changes pose significant challenges for further gaze data analysis. To address this challenge, we introduce HAGI++ - a multi-modal diffusion-based approach for gaze data imputation that, for the first time, uses the integrated head orientation sensors to exploit the inherent correlation between head and eye movements. HAGI++ employs a transformer-based diffusion model to learn cross-modal dependencies between eye and head representations and can be readily extended to incorporate additional body movements. Extensive evaluations on the large-scale Nymeria, Ego-Exo4D, and HOT3D datasets demonstrate that HAGI++ consistently outperforms conventional interpolation methods and deep learning-based time-series imputation baselines in gaze imputation. Furthermore, statistical analyses confirm that HAGI++ produces gaze velocity distributions that closely match actual human gaze behaviour, ensuring more realistic gaze imputations. Moreover, by incorporating wrist motion captured from commercial wearable devices, HAGI++ surpasses prior methods that rely on full-body motion capture in the extreme case of 100% missing gaze data (pure gaze generation). Our method paves the way for more complete and accurate eye gaze recordings in real-world settings and has significant potential for enhancing gaze-based analysis and interaction across various application domains.",

Manual segmentation achieves high accuracy but is labor-intensive and prone to variability, thus prompting the development of automated approaches. Recently, a breadth of foundation models has enabled automated segmentations across diverse anatomies and imaging modalities, but these may not always meet the clinical accuracy standards. While segmentation refinement strategies can improve performance, current methods depend on heavy user interactions or require fully supervised segmentations for training. Here, we present SCORE (Segmentation COrrection from Regional Evaluations), a weakly supervised framework that learns to refine mask predictions only using light feedback during training. Specifically, instead of relying on dense training image annotations, SCORE introduces a novel loss that leverages region-wise quality scores and over/under-segmentation error labels. We demonstrate SCORE on humerus CT scans, where it considerably improves initial predictions from TotalSegmentator, and achieves performance on par with existing refinement methods, while greatly reducing their supervision requirements and annotation time.
