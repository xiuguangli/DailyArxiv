        "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a dominant paradigm for learning on graph-structured data, thanks to their ability to jointly exploit node features and relational information encoded in the graph topology. This joint modeling, however, also introduces a critical weakness: perturbations or noise in either the structure or the features can be amplified through message passing, making GNNs highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks and spurious connections. In this work, we introduce a pruning framework that leverages adversarial robustness evaluation to explicitly identify and remove fragile or detrimental components of the graph. By using robustness scores as guidance, our method selectively prunes edges that are most likely to degrade model reliability, thereby yielding cleaner and more resilient graph representations. We instantiate this framework on three representative GNN architectures and conduct extensive experiments on benchmarks. The experimental results show that our approach can significantly enhance the defense capability of GNNs in the high-perturbation regime.",

        "abstract": "Unsupervised representation learning seeks to recover latent generative factors, yet standard methods relying on statistical independence often fail to capture causal dependencies. A central challenge is identifiability: as established in disentangled representation learning and nonlinear ICA literature, disentangling causal variables from observational data is impossible without supervision, auxiliary signals, or strong inductive biases. In this work, we propose the Latent Additive Noise Model Causal Autoencoder (LANCA) to operationalize the Additive Noise Model (ANM) as a strong inductive bias for unsupervised discovery. Theoretically, we prove that while the ANM constraint does not guarantee unique identifiability in the general mixing case, it resolves component-wise indeterminacy by restricting the admissible transformations from arbitrary diffeomorphisms to the affine class. Methodologically, arguing that the stochastic encoding inherent to VAEs obscures the structural residuals required for latent causal discovery, LANCA employs a deterministic Wasserstein Auto-Encoder (WAE) coupled with a differentiable ANM Layer. This architecture transforms residual independence from a passive assumption into an explicit optimization objective. Empirically, LANCA outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on synthetic physics benchmarks (Pendulum, Flow), and on photorealistic environments (CANDLE), where it demonstrates superior robustness to spurious correlations arising from complex background scenes.",

While recent advancements in deep learning and foundation models such as large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising forecasting capabilities, they largely overlook the spatial dependencies inherent in city-scale traffic dynamics. In this paper, we propose TIDES (Traffic Intelligence with DeepSeek-Enhanced Spatial-temporal prediction), a novel LLM-based framework that captures spatial-temporal correlations for urban wireless traffic prediction. TIDES first identifies heterogeneous traffic patterns across regions through a clustering mechanism and trains personalized models for each region to balance generalization and specialization. To bridge the domain gap between numerical traffic data and language-based models, we introduce a prompt engineering scheme that embeds statistical traffic features as structured inputs. Furthermore, we design a DeepSeek module that enables spatial alignment via cross-domain attention, allowing the LLM to leverage information from spatially related regions. By fine-tuning only lightweight components while freezing core LLM layers, TIDES achieves efficient adaptation to domain-specific patterns without incurring excessive training overhead. Extensive experiments on real-world cellular traffic datasets demonstrate that TIDES significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both prediction accuracy and robustness. Our results indicate that integrating spatial awareness into LLM-based predictors is the key to unlocking scalable and intelligent network management in future 6G systems.",

        "abstract": "A fundamental limitation of supervised deep learning in high-dimensional tabular domains is \"Generalization Collapse\": models learn precise decision boundaries for known distributions but fail catastrophically when facing Out-of-Distribution (OOD) data. We hypothesize that this failure stems from the lack of topological constraints in the latent space, resulting in diffuse manifolds where novel anomalies remain statistically indistinguishable from benign data. To address this, we propose Latent Sculpting, a hierarchical two-stage representation learning framework. Stage 1 utilizes a hybrid 1D-CNN and Transformer Encoder trained with a novel Dual-Centroid Compactness Loss (DCCL) to actively \"sculpt\" benign traffic into a low-entropy, hyperspherical cluster. Unlike standard contrastive losses that rely on triplet mining, DCCL optimizes global cluster centroids to enforce absolute manifold density. Stage 2 conditions a Masked Autoregressive Flow (MAF) on this pre-structured manifold to learn an exact density estimate. We evaluate this methodology on the rigorous CIC-IDS-2017 benchmark, treating it as a proxy for complex, non-stationary data streams. Empirical results demonstrate that explicit manifold sculpting is a prerequisite for robust zero-shot generalization. While supervised baselines suffered catastrophic performance collapse on unseen distribution shifts (F1 approx 0.30) and the strongest unsupervised baseline achieved only 0.76, our framework achieved an F1-Score of 0.87 on strictly zero-shot anomalies. Notably, we report an 88.89% detection rate on \"Infiltration\" scenarios--a complex distributional shift where state-of-the-art supervised models achieved 0.00% accuracy. These findings suggest that decoupling structure learning from density estimation provides a scalable path toward generalized anomaly detection.",

We introduce a Visual Diagnostic Framework to track the dynamic evolution of weight frequencies during training and propose a novel metric, the Spectral Suppression Ratio (SSR), to quantify the \"low-pass filtering\" intensity of different regularizers. By addressing the aliasing issue in small kernels (e.g., 3x3) through discrete radial profiling, our empirical results on ResNet-18 and CIFAR-10 demonstrate that L2 regularization suppresses high-frequency energy accumulation by over 3x compared to unregularized baselines. Furthermore, we reveal a critical Accuracy-Robustness Trade-off: while L2 models are sensitive to broadband Gaussian noise due to over-specialization in low frequencies, they exhibit superior robustness against high-frequency information loss (e.g., low resolution), outperforming baselines by >6% in blurred scenarios. This work provides a signal-processing perspective on generalization, confirming that regularization enforces a strong spectral inductive bias towards low-frequency structures.",

        "abstract": "The ruling method in modern Artificial Intelligence spanning from Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to Large Language Models (LLMs) relies on a surge of static, externally defined reward functions. While this \"extrinsic maximization\" approach has rendered superhuman performance in closed, stationary fields, it produces agents that are fragile in open-ended, real-world environments. Standard agents lack internal autonomy: they struggle to explore without dense feedback, fail to adapt to distribution shifts (non-stationarity), and require extensive manual tuning of static hyperparameters. This paper proposes that the unaddressed factor in robust autonomy is a functional analog to biological emotion, serving as a high-level homeostatic control mechanism. We introduce Emotion-Inspired Learning Signals (EILS), a unified framework that replaces scattered optimization heuristics with a coherent, bio-inspired internal feedback engine. Unlike traditional methods that treat emotions as semantic labels, EILS models them as continuous, homeostatic appraisal signals such as Curiosity, Stress, and Confidence. We formalize these signals as vector-valued internal states derived from interaction history. These states dynamically modulate the agent's optimization landscape in real time: curiosity regulates entropy to prevent mode collapse, stress modulates plasticity to overcome inactivity, and confidence adapts trust regions to stabilize convergence. We hypothesize that this closed-loop homeostatic regulation can enable EILS agents to outperform standard baselines in terms of sample efficiency and non-stationary adaptation.",

However, the major structure of transformer remains unchanged, ignoring one of its main intrinsic limitations, which is the same static value is used for every query in a head. Transformer itself tries to solve this problem by implementing multi-head attentions, yet the number of heads is limited by complexity. I propose a method to decide a value for each query dynamically, which could cut down all the redundant heads, keeping only one. Consequently, the following feed forward network could be cut down entirely, as each revised embedding has already fetched enough useful values far beyond the context. As a result, a single-head Dynamic Value Attention (DVA) is all you need in a transformer. According to the experiment, DVA may save 37.6% training time than the original transformer meanwhile increasing the learning capability.",

In this work, we identify a class of attention sinks, which we term secondary sinks, that differ fundamentally from the sinks studied in prior works, which we term primary sinks. While prior works have identified that tokens other than BOS can sometimes become sinks, they were found to exhibit properties analogous to the BOS token. Specifically, they emerge at the same layer, persist throughout the network and draw a large amount of attention mass. Whereas, we find the existence of secondary sinks that arise primarily in middle layers and can persist for a variable number of layers, and draw a smaller, but still significant, amount of attention mass. Through extensive experiments across 11 model families, we analyze where these secondary sinks appear, their properties, how they are formed, and their impact on the attention mechanism. Specifically, we show that: (1) these sinks are formed by specific middle-layer MLP modules; these MLPs map token representations to vectors that align with the direction of the primary sink of that layer. (2) The $\\ell_2$-norm of these vectors determines the sink score of the secondary sink, and also the number of layers it lasts for, thereby leading to different impacts on the attention mechanisms accordingly. (3) The primary sink weakens in middle layers, coinciding with the emergence of secondary sinks. We observe that in larger-scale models, the location and lifetime of the sinks, together referred to as sink levels, appear in a more deterministic and frequent manner. Specifically, we identify three sink levels in QwQ-32B and six levels in Qwen3-14B.",

A small set of transparent hyperparameters controls the relative influence of these components, enabling smooth adaptation between homophilic and heterophilic regimes. We further introduce a validation-gated hybrid strategy in which combinatorial predictions are optionally injected as priors into a lightweight neural model. Hybrid refinement is applied only when it improves validation performance, preserving interpretability when neuralization is unnecessary. All adaptation signals are computed strictly from training data, ensuring a leakage-free evaluation protocol.

We introduce Müntz-Szász Networks (MSN), a novel architecture that replaces fixed smooth activations with learnable fractional power bases grounded in classical approximation theory. Each MSN edge computes $\\phi(x) = \\sum_k a_k |x|^{\\mu_k} + \\sum_k b_k \\mathrm{sign}(x)|x|^{\\lambda_k}$, where the exponents $\\{\\mu_k, \\lambda_k\\}$ are learned alongside the coefficients. We prove that MSN inherits universal approximation from the Müntz-Szász theorem and establish novel approximation rates: for functions of the form $|x|^\\alpha$, MSN achieves error $\\mathcal{O}(|\\mu - \\alpha|^2)$ with a single learned exponent, whereas standard MLPs require $\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{-1/\\alpha})$ neurons for comparable accuracy. On supervised regression with singular target functions, MSN achieves 5-8x lower error than MLPs with 10x fewer parameters. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) represent a particularly demanding application for singular function approximation; on PINN benchmarks including a singular ODE and stiff boundary-layer problems, MSN achieves 3-6x improvement while learning interpretable exponents that match the known solution structure.

While recent efforts have validated their pre-training potential and accelerated inference speeds, the post-training landscape for dLLMs remains underdeveloped. Existing methods suffer from computational inefficiency and objective mismatches between training and inference, severely limiting performance on complex reasoning tasks such as mathematics. To address this, we introduce DiRL, an efficient post-training framework that tightly integrates FlexAttention-accelerated blockwise training with LMDeploy-optimized inference. This architecture enables a streamlined online model update loop, facilitating efficient two-stage post-training (Supervised Fine-Tuning followed by Reinforcement Learning). Building on this framework, we propose DiPO, the first unbiased Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) implementation tailored for dLLMs. We validate our approach by training DiRL-8B-Instruct on high-quality math data. Our model achieves state-of-the-art math performance among dLLMs and surpasses comparable models in the Qwen2.5 series on several benchmarks.",

        "abstract": "Machine learning models are primarily judged by predictive performance, especially in applied settings. Once a model reaches high accuracy, its explanation is often assumed to be correct and trustworthy. However, this assumption raises an overlooked question: when two models achieve high accuracy, do they rely on the same internal logic, or do they reach the same outcome via different -- and potentially competing -- mechanisms? We introduce EvoXplain, a diagnostic framework that measures the stability of model explanations across repeated training. Rather than analysing a single trained model, EvoXplain treats explanations as samples drawn from the stochastic optimisation process itself -- without aggregating predictions or constructing ensembles -- and examines whether these samples form a single coherent explanation or separate into multiple, distinct explanatory modes. We evaluate EvoXplain on the Breast Cancer and COMPAS datasets using two widely deployed model classes: Logistic Regression and Random Forests. Although all models achieve high predictive accuracy, their explanations frequently exhibit clear multimodality. Even models commonly assumed to be stable, such as Logistic Regression, can produce multiple well-separated explanatory basins under repeated training on the same data split. These differences are not explained by hyperparameter variation or simple performance trade-offs. EvoXplain does not attempt to select a 'correct' explanation. Instead, it makes explanatory instability visible and quantifiable, revealing when single-instance or averaged explanations obscure the existence of multiple underlying mechanisms. More broadly, EvoXplain reframes interpretability as a property of a model class under repeated instantiation, rather than of any single trained model.",

        "abstract": "Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in adults worldwide. Screening high-risk individuals with annual low-dose CT (LDCT) can support earlier detection and reduce deaths, but widespread implementation may strain the already limited radiology workforce. AI models have shown potential in estimating lung cancer risk from LDCT scans. However, high-risk populations for lung cancer are diverse, and these models' performance across demographic groups remains an open question. In this study, we drew on the considerations on confounding factors and ethically significant biases outlined in the JustEFAB framework to evaluate potential performance disparities and fairness in two deep learning risk estimation models for lung cancer screening: the Sybil lung cancer risk model and the Venkadesh21 nodule risk estimator. We also examined disparities in the PanCan2b logistic regression model recommended in the British Thoracic Society nodule management guideline. Both deep learning models were trained on data from the US-based National Lung Screening Trial (NLST), and assessed on a held-out NLST validation set. We evaluated AUROC, sensitivity, and specificity across demographic subgroups, and explored potential confounding from clinical risk factors. We observed a statistically significant AUROC difference in Sybil's performance between women (0.88, 95% CI: 0.86, 0.90) and men (0.81, 95% CI: 0.78, 0.84, p < .001). At 90% specificity, Venkadesh21 showed lower sensitivity for Black (0.39, 95% CI: 0.23, 0.59) than White participants (0.69, 95% CI: 0.65, 0.73). These differences were not explained by available clinical confounders and thus may be classified as unfair biases according to JustEFAB. Our findings highlight the importance of improving and monitoring model performance across underrepresented subgroups, and further research on algorithmic fairness, in lung cancer screening.",

Our dataset comprises oat samples collected in Ireland, containing a mix of environmental, agronomic, and geographical predictors. Five modelling approaches were evaluated: a baseline multilayer perceptron (MLP), an MLP with pre-training, and three transfer learning models; TabPFN, TabNet, and FT-Transformer. Model performance was evaluated using regression (RMSE, $R^2$) and classification (AUC, F1) metrics, with results reported per toxin and on average. Additionally, permutation-based variable importance analysis was conducted to identify the most influential predictors across both prediction tasks. The transfer learning approach TabPFN provided the overall best performance, followed by the baseline MLP. Our variable importance analysis revealed that weather history patterns in the 90-day pre-harvest period were the most important predictors, alongside seed moisture content.",

We introduce linear probes trained with a Brier score-based loss to provide calibrated uncertainty estimates from reasoning judges' hidden states, requiring no additional model training. We evaluate our approach on both objective tasks (reasoning, mathematics, factuality, coding) and subjective human preference judgments. Our results demonstrate that probes achieve superior calibration compared to existing methods with $\\approx10$x computational savings, generalize robustly to unseen evaluation domains, and deliver higher accuracy on high-confidence predictions. However, probes produce conservative estimates that underperform on easier datasets but may benefit safety-critical deployments prioritizing low false-positive rates.

        "abstract": "A systematic mismatch exists between mathematically ideal and effective activation updates during gradient descent. As intended, parameters update in their direction of steepest descent. However, activations are argued to constitute a more directly impactful quantity to prioritise in optimisation, as they are closer to the loss in the computational graph and carry sample-dependent information through the network. Yet their propagated updates do not take the optimal steepest-descent step. These quantities exhibit non-ideal sample-wise scaling across affine, convolutional, and attention layers. Solutions to correct for this are trivial and, entirely incidentally, derive normalisation from first principles despite motivational independence. Consequently, such considerations offer a fresh and conceptual reframe of normalisation's action, with auxiliary experiments bolstering this mechanistically. Moreover, this analysis makes clear a second possibility: a solution that is functionally distinct from modern normalisations, without scale-invariance, yet remains empirically successful, outperforming conventional normalisers across several tests. This is presented as an alternative to the affine map. This generalises to convolution via a new functional form, \"PatchNorm\", a compositionally inseparable normaliser. Together, these provide an alternative mechanistic framework that adds to, and counters some of, the discussion of normalisation. Further, it is argued that normalisers are better decomposed into activation-function-like maps with parameterised scaling, thereby aiding the prioritisation of representations during optimisation. Overall, this constitutes a theoretical-principled approach that yields several new functions that are empirically validated and raises questions about the affine + nonlinear approach to model creation.",

Analysis reveals a systematic positive bias in predictions, providing quantitative insight into the gap between idealized physics and real-world flight conditions.

While prior deep learning frameworks have integrated multimodal embeddings into biomedical knowledge graphs (BKGs) and further improved these representations through graph neural network message-passing paradigms, these models have been applied to tasks such as link prediction and binary drug-disease association, rather than the task of gene perturbation, which may unveil more about mechanistic transcriptomic effects. To address this gap, we construct a merged biomedical graph that integrates (i) PrimeKG++, an augmentation of PrimeKG containing semantically rich embeddings for nodes with (ii) LINCS L1000 drug and cell line nodes, initialized with multimodal embeddings from foundation models such as MolFormerXL and BioBERT. Using this heterogeneous graph, we train a graph attention network (GAT) with a downstream prediction head that learns the delta expression profile of over 978 landmark genes for a given drug-cell pair. Our results show that our framework outperforms MLP baselines for differentially expressed genes (DEG) -- which predict the delta expression given a concatenated embedding of drug features, target features, and baseline cell expression -- under the scaffold and random splits. Ablation experiments with edge shuffling and node feature randomization further demonstrate that the edges provided by biomedical KGs enhance perturbation-level prediction. More broadly, our framework provides a path toward mechanistic drug modeling: moving beyond binary drug-disease association tasks to granular transcriptional effects of therapeutic intervention.",

The aim of the study was to develop a predictive model for assessing the risk of cardiac death based on the real and synthetic data of patients undergoing PCI and to identify the factors that have the greatest impact on mortality. We analyzed 2,044 patients, who underwent a PCI for bifurcation lesions. The primary outcome was cardiac death at 3-year follow-up. Several machine learning models were applied to predict three-year mortality after PCI. To address class imbalance and improve the representation of the minority class, an additional 500 synthetic samples were generated and added to the training set. To evaluate the contribution of individual features to model performance, we applied permutation feature importance. An additional experiment was conducted to evaluate how the model's predictions would change after removing non-informative features from the training and test datasets. Without oversampling, all models achieve high overall accuracy (0.92-0.93), yet they almost completely ignore the minority class. Across models, augmentation consistently increases minority-class recall with minimal loss of AUROC, improves probability quality, and yields more clinically reasonable risk estimates on the constructed severe profiles. According to feature importance analysis, four features emerged as the most influential: Age, Ejection Fraction, Peripheral Artery Disease, and Cerebrovascular Disease. These results show that straightforward augmentation with realistic and extreme cases can expose, quantify, and reduce brittleness in imbalanced clinical prediction using only tabular records, and motivate routine reporting of probability quality and stress tests alongside headline metrics.",

We present a systematic ablation study of a physics-informed grating coupler spectrum generator that maps five geometric parameters to 100-point spectral responses. By selectively removing explicit energy conservation enforcement, Fabry-Perot oscillations, bandwidth variation, and noise, we uncover a physics constraint paradox: explicit energy conservation enforcement is mathematically redundant when the underlying equations are physically consistent, with constrained and unconstrained variants achieving identical conservation accuracy (mean error approximately 7 x 10^-9). In contrast, Fabry-Perot oscillations dominate threshold-based bandwidth variability, accounting for a 72 percent reduction in half-maximum bandwidth spread when removed (with bandwidth spread reduced from 132.3 nm to 37.4 nm). We further identify a subtle pitfall: standard noise-addition-plus-renormalization pipelines introduce 0.5 percent unphysical negative absorption values. The generator operates at 200 samples per second, enabling high-throughput data generation and remaining orders of magnitude faster than typical full-wave solvers reported in the literature. Finally, downstream machine learning evaluation reveals a clear physics-learnability trade-off: while central wavelength prediction remains unaffected, removing Fabry-Perot oscillations improves bandwidth prediction accuracy by 31.3 percent in R-squared and reduces RMSE by 73.8 percent. These findings provide actionable guidance for physics-informed dataset design and highlight machine learning performance as a diagnostic tool for assessing constraint relevance.",

We integrate this method into LuxIA, a unified simulation and training framework. The Slicing method substantially reduces memory usage and execution time, enabling scalable simulation and training of large PNNs. Experimental evaluations across various photonic architectures and standard datasets, including MNIST, Digits, and Olivetti Faces, show that LuxIA consistently surpasses existing tools in speed and scalability. Our results advance the state of the art in PNN simulation, making it feasible to explore and optimize larger, more complex architectures.

We present a hierarchical stacking optimization framework with a Dirichlet's Process (SoDip), a hierarchical data-driven framework integrating: (1) a decoder-only Transformer (DeepSeek-R1) to encode textual process descriptors (irradiation source, grafting type, substrate manufacturer); (2) TabNet and XGBoost for modelling multimodal feature interactions; (3) Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) with Dirichlet Process Mixture Models (DPMM) for uncertainty quantification and heteroscedasticity; and (4) Bayesian Optimization for efficient exploration of high-dimensional synthesis space. A diverse dataset was curated using ChemDataExtractor 2.0 and WebPlotDigitizer, incorporating numerical and textual variables across hundreds of RIG studies. In cross-validation, SoDip achieved ~33% improvement over GPR while providing calibrated confidence intervals that identify low-reproducibility regimes. Its stacked architecture integrates sparse textual and numerical inputs of varying quality, outperforming prior models and establishing a foundation for reproducible, morphology-aware design in graft polymerization research.",

        "abstract": "Modern AI systems rely on vector embeddings stored and searched using floating-point arithmetic. While effective for approximate similarity search, this design introduces fundamental non-determinism: identical models, inputs, and code can produce different memory states and retrieval results across hardware architectures (e.g., x86 vs. ARM). This prevents replayability and safe deployment, leading to silent data divergence that prevents post-hoc verification and compromises audit trails in regulated sectors. We present Valori, a deterministic AI memory substrate that replaces floating-point memory operations with fixed-point arithmetic (Q16.16) and models memory as a replayable state machine. Valori guarantees bit-identical memory states, snapshots, and search results across platforms. We demonstrate that non-determinism arises before indexing or retrieval and show how Valori enforces determinism at the memory boundary. Our results suggest that deterministic memory is a necessary primitive for trustworthy AI systems.

Recent GAN-based methods have demonstrated the feasibility of synthesizing load patterns, but most existing approaches treat all devices uniformly within a single model, neglecting the behavioral differences between intermittent and continuous appliances and resulting in unstable training and limited output fidelity. To address these limitations, we propose the Cluster Aggregated GAN framework, a hybrid generative approach that routes each appliance to a specialized branch based on its behavioral characteristics. For intermittent appliances, a clustering module groups similar activation patterns and allocates dedicated generators for each cluster, ensuring that both common and rare operational modes receive adequate modeling capacity. Continuous appliances follow a separate branch that employs an LSTM-based generator to capture gradual temporal evolution while maintaining training stability through sequence compression. Extensive experiments on the UVIC smart plug dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently outperforms baseline methods across metrics measuring realism, diversity, and training stability, and that integrating clustering as an active generative component substantially improves both interpretability and scalability. These findings establish the proposed framework as an effective approach for synthetic load generation in non-intrusive load monitoring research.",

Standard tools often miss what is happening because worker responses to algorithmic systems are rarely linear. We use a Double Machine Learning framework to estimate a moderated mediation model without imposing restrictive functional forms. Using survey data from 464 gig workers, we find a clear nonmonotonic pattern. Supportive HR practices improve worker wellbeing, but their link to performance weakens in a murky middle where algorithmic oversight is present yet hard to interpret. The relationship strengthens again when oversight is transparent and explainable. These results show why simple linear specifications can miss the pattern and sometimes suggest the opposite conclusion. For platform design, the message is practical: control that is only partly defined creates confusion, but clear rules and credible recourse can make strong oversight workable. Methodologically, the paper shows how Double Machine Learning can be used to estimate conditional indirect effects in organizational research without forcing the data into a linear shape.",

In experiments reported here, models exposed to such warnings reproduced the flagged content at rates statistically indistinguishable from models given the content directly (76.7% vs. 83.3%). Why? Sparse autoencoder analysis points to a failure of orthogonalization: \"describing X\" and \"performing X\" activate overlapping latent features. Feature #8684, which tracks code execution patterns, fires at comparable magnitude in both warning and exploitation contexts. A related phenomenon, what I call \"stealth slip\", allows conversational preambles to rotate activations into subspaces that linear probes miss entirely. Prompting and inference-time steering do not fix this; training-time feature ablation does. The upshot is that statistical co-occurrence dominates over pragmatic interpretation in current architectures. Models learn what tends to follow a context, not why it appeared there.",

This paper investigates the potential of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) to address these limitations through a novel Hybrid Quantum-Classical Mixture of Experts (QMoE) architecture. Specifically, we conduct an ablation study using a Quantum Gating Network (Router) combined with classical experts to isolate the source of quantum advantage. Our central finding validates the Interference Hypothesis: by leveraging quantum feature maps (Angle Embedding) and wave interference, the Quantum Router acts as a high-dimensional kernel method, enabling the modeling of complex, non-linear decision boundaries with superior parameter efficiency compared to its classical counterparts. Experimental results on non-linearly separable data, such as the Two Moons dataset, demonstrate that the Quantum Router achieves a significant topological advantage, effectively \"untangling\" data distributions that linear classical routers fail to separate efficiently. Furthermore, we analyze the architecture's robustness against simulated quantum noise, confirming its feasibility for near-term intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. We discuss practical applications in federated learning, privacy-preserving machine learning, and adaptive systems that could benefit from this quantum-enhanced routing paradigm.",

While conventional PD models prioritize predictive accuracy during model development with complex machine learning algorithms, they often overlook continuous adaptation to changing borrower behaviour, resulting in static models that degrade over time in production and generate inaccurate default predictions. Many financial institutes also find it difficult transitioning ML models from development environment to production and maintaining their health. With PDx we aimed to addresses these limitations using a dynamic, end-to-end model lifecycle management approach that integrates continuous model monitoring, retraining, and validation through a robust MLOps pipeline. We introduced a dynamic champion-challenger framework for PDx to regularly update baseline models to recalibrate independent parameters with the latest data and select the best-performing model through out-of-time validation, ensuring resilience against data drift and changing credit risk patterns. Our empirical analysis shows that decision tree-based ensemble models consistently outperform others in classifying defaulters but require frequent updates to sustain performance. Linear models (e.g., logistic regression) and neural networks exhibit greater performance degradation. The study demonstrate with PDx we can mitigates value erosion for digital lenders, particularly in short-term, small-ticket loans, where borrower behavior shifts rapidly. We have validated the effectiveness of PDx using datasets from peer-to-peer lending, business loans, and auto loans, demonstrating its scalability and adaptability for modern credit risk forecasting.",

We study online learning of a one-dimensional threshold policy from bandit feedback under demographic parity (DP) and, optionally, service-rate constraints. The learner observes only a scalar score each round and selects a threshold; reward and constraint residuals are revealed only for the chosen threshold. We propose Optimistic Feasible Search (OFS), a simple grid-based method that maintains confidence bounds for reward and constraint residuals for each candidate threshold. At each round, OFS selects a threshold that appears feasible under confidence bounds and, among those, maximizes optimistic reward; if no threshold appears feasible, OFS selects the threshold minimizing optimistic constraint violation. This design directly targets feasible high-utility thresholds and is particularly effective for low-dimensional, interpretable policy classes where discretization is natural. We evaluate OFS on (i) a synthetic closed-loop benchmark with stable contraction dynamics and (ii) two semi-synthetic closed-loop benchmarks grounded in German Credit and COMPAS, constructed by training a score model and feeding group-dependent acceptance decisions back into population composition. Across all environments, OFS achieves higher reward with smaller cumulative constraint violation than unconstrained and primal-dual bandit baselines, and is near-oracle relative to the best feasible fixed threshold under the same sweep procedure.

We identify a fundamental limitation: these variances are relation-agnostic, meaning an entity receives identical uncertainty regardless of relational context. This conflates two distinct out-of-distribution phenomena that behave oppositely: emerging entities (rare, poorly-learned) and novel relational contexts (familiar entities in unobserved relationships). We prove an impossibility result: any uncertainty estimator using only entity-level statistics independent of relation context achieves near-random OOD detection on novel contexts. We empirically validate this on three datasets, finding 100 percent of novel-context triples have frequency-matched in-distribution counterparts. This explains why existing probabilistic methods achieve 0.99 AUROC on random corruptions but only 0.52-0.64 on temporal distribution shift. We formalize uncertainty decomposition into complementary components: semantic uncertainty from entity embedding variance (detecting emerging entities) and structural uncertainty from entity-relation co-occurrence (detecting novel contexts). Our main theoretical result proves these signals are non-redundant, and that any convex combination strictly dominates either signal alone. Our method (CAGP) combines semantic and structural uncertainty via learned weights, achieving 0.94-0.99 AUROC on temporal OOD detection across multiple benchmarks, a 60-80 percent relative improvement over relation-agnostic baselines. Empirical validation confirms complete frequency overlap on three datasets (FB15k-237, WN18RR, YAGO3-10). On selective prediction, our method reduces errors by 43 percent at 85 percent answer rate.",

With that said, we demonstrate that while the most straightforward approach (that is likely the most used in practice) fails spectacularly, small tweaks to the training procedure with very little overhead can virtually eliminate the problem. Particularly, in this paper we consider a regularized approximate replay approach which penalizes KL divergence with respect to the initial model and interleaves in data for next token prediction from a different, yet similar, open access corpus to what was used in pre-training.

To address this critical \"safety gap,\" we propose CRC (Causality-inspired Safe Residual Correction), a plug-and-play framework explicitly designed to ensure non-degradation. CRC follows a divide-and-conquer philosophy: it employs a causality-inspired encoder to expose direction-aware structure by decoupling self- and cross-variable dynamics, and a hybrid corrector to model residual errors. Crucially, the correction process is governed by a strict four-fold safety mechanism that prevents harmful updates. Experiments across multiple datasets and forecasting backbones show that CRC consistently improves accuracy, while an in-depth ablation study confirms that its core safety mechanisms ensure exceptionally high non-degradation rates (NDR), making CRC a correction framework suited for safe and reliable deployment.",

        "abstract": "Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a widely adopted parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method. However, its linear adaptation process limits its expressive power. This means there is a gap between the expressive power of linear training and non-linear training. To bridge this gap, we propose AFA-LoRA, a novel training strategy that brings non-linear expressivity to LoRA while maintaining its seamless mergeability. Our key innovation is an annealed activation function that transitions from a non-linear to a linear transformation during training, allowing the adapter to initially adopt stronger representational capabilities before converging to a mergeable linear form. We implement our method on supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and speculative decoding. The results show that AFA-LoRA reduces the performance gap between LoRA and full-parameter training. This work enables a more powerful and practical paradigm of parameter-efficient adaptation.",

The audit shows that most physical models are fragile at this temporal resolution; PPML gravity is the strongest physical baseline, while constrained variants improve when calibrated on full OD margins but remain notably weaker. We then build residual learners on top of physical baselines using gradient-boosted trees and SHAP analysis, demonstrating that (i) physics-grounded residuals approach the accuracy of a strong tree-based predictor while retaining interpretable structure, and (ii) POI-anchored residuals are consistently competitive and most robust under spatial generalization.

Yet, new target domains often require domain expansion: a generalized model that performs well beyond any single specialist's domain. Given such a new target domain, prior works seek a single strong initialization prior for the model parameters by first blending expert models to initialize a target model. However, heuristic blending -- using coefficients based on data size or proxy metrics -- often yields lower target-domain test accuracy, and learning the coefficients on the target loss typically requires computationally-expensive full backpropagation through the network. We propose GLUE, Gradient-free Learning To Unify Experts, which initializes the target model as a convex combination of fixed experts, learning the mixture coefficients of this combination via a gradient-free two-point (SPSA) update that requires only two forward passes per step. Across experiments on three datasets and three network architectures, GLUE produces a single prior that can be fine-tuned effectively to outperform baselines. GLUE improves test accuracy by up to 8.5% over data-size weighting and by up to 9.1% over proxy-metric selection. GLUE either outperforms backpropagation-based full-gradient mixing or matches its performance within 1.4%.",

With the growing reliance on fine-tuning large pretrained models, we investigate whether LTH extends to parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), specifically focusing on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) methods. Our key finding is that LTH holds within LoRAs, revealing sparse subnetworks that can match the performance of dense adapters. In particular, we find that the effectiveness of sparse subnetworks depends more on how much sparsity is applied in each layer than on the exact weights included in the subnetwork. Building on this insight, we propose Partial-LoRA, a method that systematically identifies said subnetworks and trains sparse low-rank adapters aligned with task-relevant subspaces of the pre-trained model. Experiments across 8 vision and 12 language tasks in both single-task and multi-task settings show that Partial-LoRA reduces the number of trainable parameters by up to 87\\%, while maintaining or improving accuracy. Our results not only deepen our theoretical understanding of transfer learning and the interplay between pretraining and fine-tuning but also open new avenues for developing more efficient adaptation strategies.",

        "abstract": "Large pre-trained models have transformed machine learning, yet adapting these models effectively to exhibit precise, concept-specific behaviors remains a significant challenge. Task vectors, defined as the difference between fine-tuned and pre-trained model parameters, provide a mechanism for steering neural networks toward desired behaviors. This has given rise to large repositories dedicated to task vectors tailored for specific behaviors. The arithmetic operation of these task vectors allows for the seamless combination of desired behaviors without the need for large datasets. However, these vectors often contain overlapping concepts that can interfere with each other during arithmetic operations, leading to unpredictable outcomes. We propose a principled decomposition method that separates each task vector into two components: one capturing shared knowledge across multiple task vectors, and another isolating information unique to each specific task. By identifying invariant subspaces across projections, our approach enables more precise control over concept manipulation without unintended amplification or diminution of other behaviors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our decomposition method across three domains: improving multi-task merging in image classification by 5% using shared components as additional task vectors, enabling clean style mixing in diffusion models without generation degradation by mixing only the unique components, and achieving 47% toxicity reduction in language models while preserving performance on general knowledge tasks by negating the toxic information isolated to the unique component. Our approach provides a new framework for understanding and controlling task vector arithmetic, addressing fundamental limitations in model editing operations.",

However, in time-series forecasting, prior work has predominantly focused on encoder design, often treating prediction and training as separate or secondary concerns. In this paper, we propose TimePerceiver, a unified encoder-decoder forecasting framework that is tightly aligned with an effective training strategy. To be specific, we first generalize the forecasting task to include diverse temporal prediction objectives such as extrapolation, interpolation, and imputation. Since this generalization requires handling input and target segments that are arbitrarily positioned along the temporal axis, we design a novel encoder-decoder architecture that can flexibly perceive and adapt to these varying positions. For encoding, we introduce a set of latent bottleneck representations that can interact with all input segments to jointly capture temporal and cross-channel dependencies. For decoding, we leverage learnable queries corresponding to target timestamps to effectively retrieve relevant information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework consistently and significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art baselines across a wide range of benchmark datasets.

        "abstract": "Rank-based input normalization is a workhorse of modern machine learning, prized for its robustness to scale, monotone transformations, and batch-to-batch variation. In many real systems, the ordering of feature values matters far more than their raw magnitudes - yet the structural conditions that a rank-based normalization operator must satisfy to remain stable under these invariances have never been formally pinned down. We show that widely used differentiable sorting and ranking operators fundamentally fail these criteria. Because they rely on value gaps and batch-level pairwise interactions, they are intrinsically unstable under strictly monotone transformations, shifts in mini-batch composition, and even tiny input perturbations. Crucially, these failures stem from the operators' structural design, not from incidental implementation choices. To address this, we propose three axioms that formalize the minimal invariance and stability properties required of rank-based input normalization. We prove that any operator satisfying these axioms must factor into (i) a feature-wise rank representation and (ii) a scalarization map that is both monotone and Lipschitz-continuous. We then construct a minimal operator that meets these criteria and empirically show that the resulting constraints are non-trivial in realistic setups. Together, our results sharply delineate the design space of valid rank-based normalization operators and formally separate them from existing continuous-relaxation-based sorting methods.",

While past research has investigated AV crash, most studies rely on small-size California-centered datasets, with a limited focus on understanding crash trends across various SAE Levels of automation. This study analyzes over 2,500 AV crash records from the United States National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), covering SAE Levels 2 and 4, to uncover underlying crash dynamics. A two-stage data mining framework is developed. K-means clustering is first applied to segment crash records into 4 distinct behavioral clusters based on temporal, spatial, and environmental factors. Then, Association Rule Mining (ARM) is used to extract interpretable multivariate relationships between crash patterns and crash contributors including lighting conditions, surface condition, vehicle dynamics, and environmental conditions within each cluster. These insights provide actionable guidance for AV developers, safety regulators, and policymakers in formulating AV deployment strategies and minimizing crash risks.",

Here we present EnFlow, a unified framework that couples flow matching (FM) with an explicitly learned energy model through an energy-guided sampling scheme defined along a non-Gaussian FM path. By incorporating energy-gradient guidance during sampling, our method steers trajectories toward lower-energy regions, substantially improving conformational fidelity, particularly in the few-step regime. The learned energy function further enables efficient energy-based ranking of generated ensembles for accurate ground-state identification.

Consequently, a wide range of investors and individuals have turned to investing in the cryptocurrency market. One of the most important challenges in economics is price forecasting for future trades. Cryptocurrencies are no exception, and investors are looking for methods to predict prices; various theories and methods have been proposed in this field. This paper presents a new deep model, called \\emph{Parallel Gated Recurrent Units} (PGRU), for cryptocurrency price prediction. In this model, recurrent neural networks forecast prices in a parallel and independent way. The parallel networks utilize different inputs, each representing distinct price-related features. Finally, the outputs of the parallel networks are combined by a neural network to forecast the future price of cryptocurrencies. The experimental results indicate that the proposed model achieves mean absolute percentage errors (MAPE) of 3.243% and 2.641% for window lengths 20 and 15, respectively. Our method therefore attains higher accuracy and efficiency with fewer input data and lower computational cost compared to existing methods.",

Due to the inherent complexity and relationship between important economic and political components, accurate forecasting of financial markets has always been challenging. Therefore, providing a model that can accurately predict the future of the markets is very important and will be of great benefit to their developers. In this paper, an artificial intelligence-based algorithm for daily and monthly gold forecasting is presented. Two Long short-term memory (LSTM) networks are responsible for daily and monthly forecasting, the results of which are integrated into a Multilayer perceptrons (MLP) network and provide the final forecast of the next day prices. The algorithm forecasts the highest, lowest, and closing prices on the daily and monthly time frame. Based on these forecasts, a trading strategy for live market trading was developed, according to which the proposed model had a return of 171% in three months. Also, the number of internal neurons in each network is optimized by the Gray Wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm based on the least RMSE error. The dataset was collected between 2010 and 2021 and includes data on macroeconomic, energy markets, stocks, and currency status of developed countries. Our proposed LSTM-MLP model predicted the daily closing price of gold with the Mean absolute error (MAE) of $ 0.21 and the next month's price with $ 22.23.",

Biased compression techniques are effective in practice, but require error feedback mechanisms to provide theoretical guarantees and to ensure convergence when compression is aggressive. Standard error feedback, however, relies on client-specific control variates, which violates user privacy and is incompatible with stateless clients common in large-scale FL. This paper proposes two novel frameworks that enable biased compression without client-side state or control variates. The first, Compressed Aggregate Feedback (CAFe), uses the globally aggregated update from the previous round as a shared control variate for all clients. The second, Server-Guided Compressed Aggregate Feedback (CAFe-S), extends this idea to scenarios where the server possesses a small private dataset; it generates a server-guided candidate update to be used as a more accurate predictor. We consider Distributed Gradient Descent (DGD) as a representative algorithm and analytically prove CAFe's superiority to Distributed Compressed Gradient Descent (DCGD) with biased compression in the non-convex regime with bounded gradient dissimilarity. We further prove that CAFe-S converges to a stationary point, with a rate that improves as the server's data become more representative. Experimental results in FL scenarios validate the superiority of our approaches over existing compression schemes.",

While recent work has explored quantum models for learning statistical properties of fluid systems, the combination of discrete latent space compression with quantum generative sampling for CFD remains unexplored. We develop a GPU-accelerated Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) simulator to generate fluid vorticity fields, which are compressed into a discrete 7-dimensional latent space using a Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE). The central contribution is a comparative analysis of quantum and classical generative approaches for modeling this physics-derived latent distribution: we evaluate a Quantum Circuit Born Machine (QCBM) and Quantum Generative Adversarial Network (QGAN) against a classical Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) baseline. Under our experimental conditions, both quantum models produced samples with lower average minimum distances to the true distribution compared to the LSTM, with the QCBM achieving the most favorable metrics. This work provides: (1)~a complete open-source pipeline bridging CFD simulation and quantum machine learning, (2)~the first empirical study of quantum generative modeling on compressed latent representations of physics simulations, and (3)~a foundation for future rigorous investigation at this intersection.",

While centralized approaches have been extensively studied, decentralized methods remain largely underexplored. We study decentralized multi-task representation learning in which the features share a low-rank structure. We consider multiple tasks, each with a finite number of data samples, where the observations follow a linear model with task-specific parameters. In the decentralized setting, task data are distributed across multiple nodes, and information exchange between nodes is constrained by a communication network. The goal is to recover the underlying feature matrix whose rank is much smaller than both the parameter dimension and the number of tasks. We propose a new alternating projected gradient and minimization algorithm with provable accuracy guarantees. We provide comprehensive characterizations of the time, communication, and sample complexities. Importantly, the communication complexity is independent of the target accuracy, which significantly reduces communication cost compared to prior methods. Numerical simulations validate the theoretical analysis across different dimensions and network topologies, and demonstrate regimes in which decentralized learning outperforms centralized federated approaches.",

However, the large quantity of newly proposed architectures, together with often contradictory empirical results, makes it difficult to assess which components contribute significantly to final performance. We aim to make sense of the current design space of deep learning architectures for time series forecasting by discussing the design dimensions and trade-offs that can explain, often unexpected, observed results. This paper discusses the necessity of grounding model design on principles for forecasting groups of time series and how such principles can be applied to current models. In particular, we assess how concepts such as locality and globality apply to recent forecasting architectures. We show that accounting for these aspects can be more relevant for achieving accurate results than adopting specific sequence modeling layers and that simple, well-designed forecasting architectures can often match the state of the art. We discuss how overlooked implementation details in existing architectures (1) fundamentally change the class of the resulting forecasting method and (2) drastically affect the observed empirical results. Our results call for rethinking current faulty benchmarking practices and the need to focus on the foundational aspects of the forecasting problem when designing architectures. As a step in this direction, we propose an auxiliary forecasting model card, whose fields serve to characterize existing and new forecasting architectures based on key design choices.",

Ensuring the reliability and executability of such systems requires validating generated SQL, but most existing approaches focus only on syntactic correctness, with few addressing semantic validation (detecting misalignments between questions and SQL). As a consequence, effective semantic validation still faces two key challenges: capturing both global user intent and SQL structural details, and constructing high-quality fine-grained sub-SQL annotations. To tackle these, we introduce HEROSQL, a hierarchical SQL representation approach that integrates global intent (via Logical Plans, LPs) and local details (via Abstract Syntax Trees, ASTs). To enable better information propagation, we employ a Nested Message Passing Neural Network (NMPNN) to capture inherent relational information in SQL and aggregate schema-guided semantics across LPs and ASTs. Additionally, to generate high-quality negative samples, we propose an AST-driven sub-SQL augmentation strategy, supporting robust optimization of fine-grained semantic inconsistencies. Extensive experiments conducted on Text-to-SQL validation benchmarks (both in-domain and out-of-domain settings) demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average 9.40% improvement of AUPRC and 12.35% of AUROC in identifying semantic inconsistencies. It excels at detecting fine-grained semantic errors, provides large language models with more granular feedback, and ultimately enhances the reliability and interpretability of data querying platforms.",

In this study, we introduce a micro-macro machine learning framework that integrates (1) individual-level anthropometric and socioeconomic data from NHANES and (2) macro-level structural environment features, including food access, air quality, and socioeconomic vulnerability extracted from USDA and EPA datasets. Four machine learning models Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM were trained to predict obesity using NHANES microdata. XGBoost achieved the strongest performance. A composite environmental vulnerability index (EnvScore) was constructed using normalized indicators from USDA and EPA at the state level. Multi-level comparison revealed strong geographic similarity between states with high environmental burden and the nationally predicted micro-level obesity risk distribution. This demonstrates the feasibility of integrating multi-scale datasets to identify environment-driven disparities in obesity risk.

Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for processing such graphs, but the lack of transparency and explainability limits their practical adoption. Research on TGNN explainability is still in its early stages and faces several key issues: (i) Current methods are tailored to specific TGNN types, restricting generality. (ii) They suffer from high computational costs, making them unsuitable for large-scale networks. (iii) They often overlook the structural connectivity of explanations and require prior knowledge, reducing user-friendliness. To address these issues, we propose GRExplainer, the first universal, efficient, and user-friendly explanation method for TGNNs. GRExplainer extracts node sequences as a unified feature representation, making it independent of specific input formats and thus applicable to both snapshot-based and event-based TGNNs (the major types of TGNNs). By utilizing breadth-first search and temporal information to construct input node sequences, GRExplainer reduces redundant computation and improves efficiency. To enhance user-friendliness, we design a generative model based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), enabling automated and continuous explanation generation. Experiments on six real-world datasets with three target TGNNs show that GRExplainer outperforms existing baseline methods in generality, efficiency, and user-friendliness.",

This RL driven approach dynamically guides the student to explore multiple denoising paths, allowing it to take longer, optimized steps toward high-probability regions of the data distribution, rather than relying on incremental refinements. Our framework utilizes the inherent ability of diffusion models to handle larger steps and effectively manage the generative process. Experimental results show that our method achieves superior performance with significantly fewer inference steps and computational resources compared to existing distillation techniques.

        "abstract": "Accurate long-range weather forecasting remains a major challenge for AI models, both because errors accumulate over autoregressive rollouts and because reanalysis datasets used for training offer a limited sample of the slow modes of climate variability underpinning predictability. Most AI weather models are autoregressive, producing short lead forecasts that must be repeatedly applied to reach subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) or seasonal lead times, often resulting in instability and calibration issues. Long-timestep probabilistic models that generate long-range forecasts in a single step offer an attractive alternative, but training on the 40-year reanalysis record leads to overfitting, suggesting orders of magnitude more training data are required. We introduce long-range distillation, a method that trains a long-timestep probabilistic \"student\" model to forecast directly at long-range using a huge synthetic training dataset generated by a short-timestep autoregressive \"teacher\" model. Using the Deep Learning Earth System Model (DLESyM) as the teacher, we generate over 10,000 years of simulated climate to train distilled student models for forecasting across a range of timescales. In perfect-model experiments, the distilled models outperform climatology and approach the skill of their autoregressive teacher while replacing hundreds of autoregressive steps with a single timestep. In the real world, they achieve S2S forecast skill comparable to the ECMWF ensemble forecast after ERA5 fine-tuning. The skill of our distilled models scales with increasing synthetic training data, even when that data is orders of magnitude larger than ERA5. This represents the first demonstration that AI-generated synthetic training data can be used to scale long-range forecast skill.",

However, uniform goal selection often results in sample inefficiency in multi-goal settings where agents must learn a universal goal-conditioned policy. Inspired by the adaptive and structured learning processes observed in biological systems, we propose a novel Student-Teacher learning paradigm with a Temporal Variance-Driven Curriculum to accelerate Goal-Conditioned RL. In this framework, the teacher module dynamically prioritizes goals with the highest temporal variance in the policy's confidence score, parameterized by the state-action value (Q) function. The teacher provides an adaptive and focused learning signal by targeting these high-uncertainty goals, fostering continual and efficient progress. We establish a theoretical connection between the temporal variance of Q-values and the evolution of the policy, providing insights into the method's underlying principles. Our approach is algorithm-agnostic and integrates seamlessly with existing RL frameworks. We demonstrate this through evaluation across 11 diverse robotic manipulation and maze navigation tasks. The results show consistent and notable improvements over state-of-the-art curriculum learning and goal-selection methods.",

We present an in-depth study of the target loss estimation error relative to the surrogate loss estimation error. Our analysis leads to $H$-consistency bounds, which are guarantees accounting for the hypothesis set $H$. These bounds offer stronger guarantees than Bayes-consistency or $H$-calibration and are more informative than excess error bounds. We begin with binary classification, establishing tight distribution-dependent and -independent bounds. We provide explicit bounds for convex surrogates (including linear models and neural networks) and analyze the adversarial setting for surrogates like $\\rho$-margin and sigmoid loss. Extending to multi-class classification, we present the first $H$-consistency bounds for max, sum, and constrained losses, covering both non-adversarial and adversarial scenarios. We demonstrate that in some cases, non-trivial $H$-consistency bounds are unattainable. We also investigate comp-sum losses (e.g., cross-entropy, MAE), deriving their first $H$-consistency bounds and introducing smooth adversarial variants that yield robust learning algorithms. We develop a comprehensive framework for deriving these bounds across various surrogates, introducing new characterizations for constrained and comp-sum losses. Finally, we examine the growth rates of $H$-consistency bounds, establishing a universal square-root growth rate for smooth surrogates in binary and multi-class tasks, and analyze minimizability gaps to guide surrogate selection.",

Leveraging multiple experts offers a solution: deferring uncertain inputs to more capable experts improves reliability, while routing simpler queries to smaller, distilled models enhances efficiency. This motivates the problem of learning with multiple-expert deferral. This thesis presents a comprehensive study of this problem and the related problem of learning with abstention, supported by strong consistency guarantees. First, for learning with abstention (a special case of deferral), we analyze score-based and predictor-rejector formulations in multi-class classification. We introduce new families of surrogate losses and prove strong non-asymptotic, hypothesis set-specific consistency guarantees, resolving two existing open questions. We analyze both single-stage and practical two-stage settings, with experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN demonstrating the superior performance of our algorithms. Second, we address general multi-expert deferral in classification. We design new surrogate losses for both single-stage and two-stage scenarios and prove they benefit from strong $H$-consistency bounds. For the two-stage scenario, we show that our surrogate losses are realizable $H$-consistent for constant cost functions, leading to effective new algorithms. Finally, we introduce a novel framework for regression with deferral to address continuous label spaces. Our versatile framework accommodates multiple experts and various cost structures, supporting both single-stage and two-stage methods. It subsumes recent work on regression with abstention. We propose new surrogate losses with proven $H$-consistency and demonstrate the empirical effectiveness of the resulting algorithms.",

However, most existing models are designed for centralized settings, rendering them inapplicable in modern decentralized environments. Moreover, current federated learning approaches often suffer from poor generalization performance due to reliance on unreliable pseudo-labels, and fail to capture the latent correlations amongst heterogeneous clients. To tackle these limitations, this paper proposes a novel framework named Federated Multi-Task Clustering (i.e.,FMTC), which intends to learn personalized clustering models for heterogeneous clients while collaboratively leveraging their shared underlying structure in a privacy-preserving manner. More specifically, the FMTC framework is composed of two main components: client-side personalized clustering module, which learns a parameterized mapping model to support robust out-of-sample inference, bypassing the need for unreliable pseudo-labels; and server-side tensorial correlation module, which explicitly captures the shared knowledge across all clients. This is achieved by organizing all client models into a unified tensor and applying a low-rank regularization to discover their common subspace. To solve this joint optimization problem, we derive an efficient, privacy-preserving distributed algorithm based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers, which decomposes the global problem into parallel local updates on clients and an aggregation step on the server. To the end, several extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed FMTC framework significantly outperforms various baseline and state-of-the-art federated clustering algorithms.",

This paper proposes a new framework, GraphLogDebugger, to debug tabular log based on dynamic graphs. By constructing heterogeneous nodes for objects and events and connecting node-wise edges, the framework recovers the system behind the tabular log as an evolving dynamic graph. With the help of our dynamic graph modeling, a simple dynamic Graph Neural Network (GNN) is representative enough to outperform LLMs in debugging tabular log, which is validated by experimental results on real-world log datasets of computer systems and academic papers.",

So far, many research works have used deep learning models to explore the complex interactions between students, questions, and skills. However, the performance of existing method is frequently limited by the long-tailed distribution and dynamic changes in the data. To address these challenges, we propose a meta-learning framework for cognitive diagnosis based on continual learning (MetaCD). This framework can alleviate the long-tailed problem by utilizing meta-learning to learn the optimal initialization state, enabling the model to achieve good accuracy on new tasks with only a small amount of data. In addition, we utilize a continual learning method named parameter protection mechanism to give MetaCD the ability to adapt to new skills or new tasks, in order to adapt to dynamic changes in data. MetaCD can not only improve the plasticity of our model on a single task, but also ensure the stability and generalization of the model on sequential tasks. Comprehensive experiments on five real-world datasets show that MetaCD outperforms other baselines in both accuracy and generalization.",

MTD can be computed directly from pre-trained models with multiple prediction heads, requiring no additional training. Building on this, we introduce Divergence Steering, a novel decoding method to control the computational character of generated text. We empirically show that MTD is more effective than prior methods at distinguishing complex tasks from simple ones. On mathematical reasoning benchmarks, MTD correlates positively with problem difficulty. Lower MTD is associated with more accurate reasoning.

Current Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) continual learning techniques often retain and freeze previously learned LoRAs or generate data representations to overcome forgetting, typically utilizing these to support new LoRAs learn new tasks. However, these methods not only ignore growing computational memory with tasks and limited storage space but also suffer from potential task interference due to the lack of effective LoRA merging mechanisms. In this paper, we propose a novel continual learning method that orthogonally initializes and sequentially merges LoRAs updates into a single unified LoRA. Our method leverages orthogonal basis extraction from previously learned LoRA to initialize the learning of new tasks, further exploits the intrinsic asymmetry property of LoRA components by using a time-aware scaling mechanism to balance new and old knowledge during continual merging. Our approach maintains constant memory complexity with respect to the number of tasks, minimizes interference between past and new tasks via orthogonal basis initialization, and improves performance over asymmetric LoRA merging via adaptive scaling. We provide theoretical analysis to justify our design and conduct extensive experiments across diverse continual learning benchmarks using various Llama models, demonstrating the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.",

Using Intersection-over-Union (IoU) to quantify circuit preservation, we provide the first mechanistic evidence that Non-IID data distributions cause structurally distinct local circuits to diverge, leading to their degradation in the global model. Our findings reframe the problem of statistical drift in FL as a concrete, observable failure of mechanistic preservation, paving the way for more targeted solutions.",

However, existing multi-operator learning approaches are data-hungry and neglect physics during training. Here, we propose a physics-informed multimodal foundation model (PI-MFM) framework that directly enforces governing equations during pretraining and adaptation. PI-MFM takes symbolic representations of PDEs as the input, and automatically assembles PDE residual losses from the input expression via a vectorized derivative computation. These designs enable any PDE-encoding multimodal foundation model to be trained or adapted with unified physics-informed objectives across equation families. On a benchmark of 13 parametric one-dimensional time-dependent PDE families, PI-MFM consistently outperforms purely data-driven counterparts, especially with sparse labeled spatiotemporal points, partially observed time domains, or few labeled function pairs. Physics losses further improve robustness against noise, and simple strategies such as resampling collocation points substantially improve accuracy. We also analyze the accuracy, precision, and computational cost of automatic differentiation and finite differences for derivative computation within PI-MFM. Finally, we demonstrate zero-shot physics-informed fine-tuning to unseen PDE families: starting from a physics-informed pretrained model, adapting using only PDE residuals and initial/boundary conditions, without any labeled solution data, rapidly reduces test errors to around 1% and clearly outperforms physics-only training from scratch. These results show that PI-MFM provides a practical and scalable path toward data-efficient, transferable PDE solvers.",

This memory constraint precludes genomic-scale modeling (L > 10^5) on consumer-grade hardware. We introduce Phase Gradient Flow (PGF), a framework that computes exact analytical derivatives by operating directly in the state-space manifold, bypassing the need to materialize the intermediate computational graph. By reframing SSM dynamics as Tiled Operator-Space Evolution (TOSE), our method delivers O(1) memory complexity relative to sequence length, yielding a 94% reduction in peak VRAM and a 23x increase in throughput compared to standard Autograd. Unlike parallel prefix scans that exhibit numerical divergence in stiff ODE regimes, PGF ensures stability through invariant error scaling, maintaining near-machine precision across extreme sequences. We demonstrate the utility of PGF on an impulse-response benchmark with 128,000-step sequences - a scale where conventional Autograd encounters prohibitive memory overhead, often leading to out-of-memory (OOM) failures in multi-layered models.

To this end, we propose \\textbf{FLEX-MoE}, a novel federated MoE framework that jointly optimizes expert assignment and load balancing under limited client capacity. Specifically, our approach introduces client-expert fitness scores that quantify the expert suitability for local datasets through training feedback, and employs an optimization-based algorithm to maximize client-expert specialization while enforcing balanced expert utilization system-wide. Unlike existing greedy methods that focus solely on personalization while ignoring load imbalance, our FLEX-MoE is capable of addressing the expert utilization skew, which is particularly severe in FL settings with heterogeneous data. Our comprehensive experiments on three different datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed FLEX-MoE, together with its ability to maintain balanced expert utilization across diverse resource-constrained scenarios.",

When $\\pi_{\\text{roll}} \\ne \\pi_{\\theta}$, there is approximation error between the surrogate and the true objective. Prior work has shown that this off-policy mismatch is unavoidable in modern LLM-RL due to implementation divergence, mixture-of-experts routing discontinuities, and distributed training staleness. Classical trust region bounds on the resulting error scale as $O(T^2)$ with sequence length $T$, rendering them vacuous for long-horizon tasks. We derive two tighter bounds: a Pinsker-Marginal bound scaling as $O(T^{3/2})$ and a Mixed bound scaling as $O(T)$. Crucially, both bounds depend on $D_{kl}^{tok,max}$ -- the maximum token-level KL divergence across all positions in a sequence. This is inherently a sequence-level quantity: it requires examining the entire trajectory to compute, and therefore cannot be controlled by token-independent methods like PPO clipping. We propose Trust Region Masking (TRM), which excludes entire sequences from gradient computation if any token violates the trust region, providing the first non-vacuous monotonic improvement guarantees for long-horizon LLM-RL.",

We prove this mismatch has an asymmetric effect: the bound on log-probability mismatch scales as $(1-p)$ where $p$ is the token probability. For high-probability tokens, this bound vanishes, contributing negligibly to sequence-level mismatch. For low-probability tokens in the tail, the bound remains large, and moreover, when sampled, these tokens exhibit systematically biased mismatches that accumulate over sequences, destabilizing gradient estimation. Rather than applying post-hoc corrections, we propose constraining the RL objective to a dynamically-pruned ``safe'' vocabulary that excludes the extreme tail. By pruning such tokens, we trade large, systematically biased mismatches for a small, bounded optimization bias. Empirically, our method achieves stable training; theoretically, we bound the optimization bias introduced by vocabulary pruning.",

The core of OSM-L is osmosis, a process that synthesizes dense and compact representation by extracting contextual information, eliminating the need for raw data exchange between distributed entities. OSM-L iteratively aligns local data representations, enabling information diffusion and convergence into a dynamic equilibrium that captures contextual patterns. During training, it also identifies correlated data groups, functioning as a decentralized clustering mechanism.

Using physical parameters under different working conditions as inputs, the model outputs layer-wise acceleration features, thereby establishing a nonlinear mapping between physical parameters and penetration characteristics. Comparative experiments against conventional MLP, XGBoost, and Transformer models demonstrate that SE-MLP achieves superior prediction accuracy, generalization, and stability. Ablation studies further confirm that both the channel attention module and residual structure contribute significantly to performance gains. Numerical simulations and range recovery tests show that the discrepancies between predicted and measured acceleration peaks and pulse widths remain within acceptable engineering tolerances.

To address this challenge, we introduce a time-aware graph neural network model with transformer fusion (GNN-TF).

Even in tasks with abundant strong signals, the key to improving model performance often lies in effectively extracting weak signals. However, the lack of dedicated datasets has long constrained research. To address this, we construct the first specialized dataset for weak signal feature learning, containing 13,158 spectral samples. It features low SNR dominance (over 55% samples with SNR below 50) and extreme class imbalance (class ratio up to 29:1), providing a challenging benchmark for classification and regression in weak signal scenarios. We also propose a dual-view representation (vector + time-frequency map) and a PDVFN model tailored to low SNR, distribution skew, and dual imbalance. PDVFN extracts local sequential features and global frequency-domain structures in parallel, following principles of local enhancement, sequential modeling, noise suppression, multi-scale capture, frequency extraction, and global perception. This multi-source complementarity enhances representation for low-SNR and imbalanced data, offering a novel solution for WSL tasks like astronomical spectroscopy. Experiments show our method achieves higher accuracy and robustness in handling weak signals, high noise, and extreme class imbalance, especially in low SNR and imbalanced scenarios.

        "abstract": "We systematically evaluate Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods under the paradigm of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). RLVR incentivizes language models to enhance their reasoning capabilities through verifiable feedback; however, while methods like LoRA are commonly used, the optimal PEFT architecture for RLVR remains unidentified. In this work, we conduct the first comprehensive evaluation of over 12 PEFT methodologies across the DeepSeek-R1-Distill families on mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Our empirical results challenge the default adoption of standard LoRA with three main findings. First, we demonstrate that structural variants, such as DoRA, AdaLoRA, and MiSS, consistently outperform LoRA. Second, we uncover a spectral collapse phenomenon in SVD-informed initialization strategies (\\textit{e.g.,} PiSSA, MiLoRA), attributing their failure to a fundamental misalignment between principal-component updates and RL optimization. Furthermore, our ablations reveal that extreme parameter reduction (\\textit{e.g.,} VeRA, Rank-1) severely bottlenecks reasoning capacity. We further conduct ablation studies and scaling experiments to validate our findings. This work provides a definitive guide for advocating for more exploration for parameter-efficient RL methods.",

        "abstract": "Therapeutic peptides have emerged as a pivotal modality in modern drug discovery, occupying a chemically and topologically rich space. While accurate prediction of their physicochemical properties is essential for accelerating peptide development, existing molecular language models rely on representations that fail to capture this complexity. Atom-level SMILES notation generates long token sequences and obscures cyclic topology, whereas amino-acid-level representations cannot encode the diverse chemical modifications central to modern peptide design. To bridge this representational gap, the Hierarchical Editing Language for Macromolecules (HELM) offers a unified framework enabling precise description of both monomer composition and connectivity, making it a promising foundation for peptide language modeling. Here, we propose HELM-BERT, the first encoder-based peptide language model trained on HELM notation. Based on DeBERTa, HELM-BERT is specifically designed to capture hierarchical dependencies within HELM sequences. The model is pre-trained on a curated corpus of 39,079 chemically diverse peptides spanning linear and cyclic structures. HELM-BERT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art SMILES-based language models in downstream tasks, including cyclic peptide membrane permeability prediction and peptide-protein interaction prediction. These results demonstrate that HELM's explicit monomer- and topology-aware representations offer substantial data-efficiency advantages for modeling therapeutic peptides, bridging a long-standing gap between small-molecule and protein language models.",

        "abstract": "Online eXp-concave Optimization (OXO) is a fundamental problem in online learning. The standard algorithm, Online Newton Step (ONS), balances statistical optimality and computational practicality, guaranteeing an optimal regret of $O(d \\log T)$, where $d$ is the dimension and $T$ is the time horizon. ONS faces a computational bottleneck due to the Mahalanobis projections at each round. This step costs $\\Omega(d^\\omega)$ arithmetic operations for bounded domains, even for the unit ball, where $\\omega \\in (2,3]$ is the matrix-multiplication exponent. As a result, the total runtime can reach $\\tilde{O}(d^\\omega T)$, particularly when iterates frequently oscillate near the domain boundary. For Stochastic eXp-concave Optimization (SXO), computational cost is also a challenge. Deploying ONS with online-to-batch conversion for SXO requires $T = \\tilde{O}(d/\\epsilon)$ rounds to achieve an excess risk of $\\epsilon$, and thereby necessitates an $\\tilde{O}(d^{\\omega+1}/\\epsilon)$ runtime. A COLT'13 open problem posed by Koren [2013] asks for an SXO algorithm with runtime less than $\\tilde{O}(d^{\\omega+1}/\\epsilon)$. This paper proposes a simple variant of ONS, LightONS, which reduces the total runtime to $O(d^2 T + d^\\omega \\sqrt{T \\log T})$ while preserving the optimal $O(d \\log T)$ regret. LightONS implies an SXO method with runtime $\\tilde{O}(d^3/\\epsilon)$, thereby answering the open problem. Importantly, LightONS preserves the elegant structure of ONS by leveraging domain-conversion techniques from parameter-free online learning to introduce a hysteresis mechanism that delays expensive Mahalanobis projections until necessary. This design enables LightONS to serve as an efficient plug-in replacement of ONS in broader scenarios, even beyond regret minimization, including gradient-norm adaptive regret, parametric stochastic bandits, and memory-efficient online learning.",

Utilizing a ``physics slicing-geometry injection\" mechanism, this module incorporates multi-scale geometric encodings to explicitly preserve multi-scale geometric features while maintaining linear computational complexity $O(N)$. Furthermore, PGOT dynamically routes computations to low-order linear paths for smooth regions and high-order non-linear paths for shock waves and discontinuities based on spatial coordinates, enabling spatially adaptive and high-precision physical field modeling. PGOT achieves consistent state-of-the-art performance across four standard benchmarks and excels in large-scale industrial tasks including airfoil and car designs.",

        "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a privacy-preserving paradigm for training machine learning models across distributed edge devices in the Internet of Things (IoT). By keeping data local and coordinating model training through a central server, FL effectively addresses privacy concerns and reduces communication overhead. However, the limited computational power, memory, and bandwidth of IoT edge devices pose significant challenges to the efficiency and scalability of FL, especially when training deep neural networks. Various FL frameworks have been proposed to reduce computation and communication overheads through dropout or layer freezing. However, these approaches often sacrifice accuracy or neglect memory constraints. To this end, in this work, we introduce Federated Learning with Ordered Layer Freezing (FedOLF). FedOLF consistently freezes layers in a predefined order before training, significantly mitigating computation and memory requirements. To further reduce communication and energy costs, we incorporate Tensor Operation Approximation (TOA), a lightweight alternative to conventional quantization that better preserves model accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that over non-iid data, FedOLF achieves at least 0.3%, 6.4%, 5.81%, 4.4%, 6.27% and 1.29% higher accuracy than existing works respectively on EMNIST (with CNN), CIFAR-10 (with AlexNet), CIFAR-100 (with ResNet20 and ResNet44), and CINIC-10 (with ResNet20 and ResNet44), along with higher energy efficiency and lower memory footprint.",

However, graph data often exhibits overlap among different clients. Previous research has demonstrated certain benefits of overlapping data in mitigating data heterogeneity. However, the negative effects have not been explored, particularly in cases where the overlaps are imbalanced across clients. In this paper, we uncover the unfairness issue arising from imbalanced overlapping subgraphs through both empirical observations and theoretical reasoning. To address this issue, we propose FairGFL (FAIRness-aware subGraph Federated Learning), a novel algorithm that enhances cross-client fairness while maintaining model utility in a privacy-preserving manner. Specifically, FairGFL incorporates an interpretable weighted aggregation approach to enhance fairness across clients, leveraging privacy-preserving estimation of their overlapping ratios. Furthermore, FairGFL improves the tradeoff between model utility and fairness by integrating a carefully crafted regularizer into the federated composite loss function. Through extensive experiments on four benchmark graph datasets, we demonstrate that FairGFL outperforms four representative baseline algorithms in terms of both model utility and fairness.",

        "abstract": "Making deep learning recommendation model (DLRM) training and inference fast and efficient is important. However, this presents three key system challenges - model architecture diversity, kernel primitive diversity, and hardware generation and architecture heterogeneity. This paper presents KernelEvolve-an agentic kernel coding framework-to tackle heterogeneity at-scale for DLRM. KernelEvolve is designed to take kernel specifications as input and automate the process of kernel generation and optimization for recommendation model across heterogeneous hardware architectures. KernelEvolve does so by operating at multiple programming abstractions, from Triton and CuTe DSL to low-level hardware agnostic languages, spanning the full hardware-software optimization stack. The kernel optimization process is described as graph-based search with selection policy, universal operator, fitness function, and termination rule, dynamically adapts to runtime execution context through retrieval-augmented prompt synthesis. We designed, implemented, and deployed KernelEvolve to optimize a wide variety of production recommendation models across generations of NVIDIA and AMD GPUs, as well as Meta's AI accelerators. We validate KernelEvolve on the publicly-available KernelBench suite, achieving 100% pass rate on all 250 problems across three difficulty levels, and 160 PyTorch ATen operators across three heterogeneous hardware platforms, demonstrating 100% correctness. KernelEvolve reduces development time from weeks to hours and achieves substantial performance improvements over PyTorch baselines across diverse production use cases and for heterogeneous AI systems at-scale. Beyond performance efficiency improvements, KernelEvolve significantly mitigates the programmability barrier for new AI hardware by enabling automated kernel generation for in-house developed AI hardware.",

In this paper, we propose PFed-signal, a federated learning-based signal prediction model of ADR, which utilizes the Euclidean distance to eliminate the biased data from FAERS, thereby improving the accuracy of ADR prediction. Specifically, we first propose Pfed-Split, a method to split the original dataset into a split dataset based on ADR. Then we propose ADR-signal, an ADR prediction model, including a biased data identification method based on federated learning and an ADR prediction model based on Transformer. The former identifies the biased data according to the Euclidean distance and generates a clean dataset by deleting the biased data. The latter is an ADR prediction model based on Transformer trained on the clean data set. The results show that the ROR and PRR on the clean dataset are better than those of the traditional methods. Furthermore, the accuracy rate, F1 score, recall rate and AUC of PFed-Signal are 0.887, 0.890, 0.913 and 0.957 respectively, which are higher than the baselines.",

Unlike soft-constrained formulations where boundary terms act as additive penalties, this work reveals that the boundary function $B$ introduces a multiplicative spatial modulation that fundamentally alters the learning landscape. A rigorous Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) framework for HC-PINNs is established, deriving the explicit kernel composition law. This relationship demonstrates that the boundary function $B(\\vec{x})$ functions as a spectral filter, reshaping the eigenspectrum of the neural network's native kernel. Through spectral analysis, the effective rank of the residual kernel is identified as a deterministic predictor of training convergence, superior to classical condition numbers. It is shown that widely used boundary functions can inadvertently induce spectral collapse, leading to optimization stagnation despite exact boundary satisfaction. Validated across multi-dimensional benchmarks, this framework transforms the design of boundary functions from a heuristic choice into a principled spectral optimization problem, providing a solid theoretical foundation for geometric hard constraints in scientific machine learning.",

Cloud-only inference reduces device burden but introduces high latency and cost. Static edge-cloud partitions optimize a single metric and struggle when bandwidth fluctuates. We propose Splitwise, a novel Lyapunov-assisted deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for fine-grained, adaptive partitioning of LLMs across edge and cloud environments. Splitwise decomposes transformer layers into attention heads and feed-forward sub-blocks, exposing more partition choices than layer-wise schemes. A hierarchical DRL policy, guided by Lyapunov optimization, jointly minimizes latency, energy consumption, and accuracy degradation while guaranteeing queue stability under stochastic workloads and variable network bandwidth. Splitwise also guarantees robustness via partition checkpoints with exponential backoff recovery in case of communication failures. Experiments on Jetson Orin NX, Galaxy S23, and Raspberry Pi 5 with GPT-2 (1.5B), LLaMA-7B, and LLaMA-13B show that Splitwise reduces end-to-end latency by 1.4x-2.8x and cuts energy consumption by up to 41% compared with existing partitioners.

Following the same principles and notations already put in place there, we now focus on transformer-based next-token-prediction architectures. To this end, we apply our lightweight index-free methodology to new types of layers such as embedding, multi-headed self-attention and layer normalization. In addition, we also provide gradient expressions for LoRA layers to illustrate parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Why bother doing manual backpropagation when there are so many tools that do this automatically? Any gap in understanding of how values propagate forward will become evident when attempting to differentiate the loss function. By working through the backward pass manually, we gain a deeper intuition for how each operation influences the final output. A complete PyTorch implementation of a minimalistic GPT-like network is also provided along with analytical expressions for of all of its gradient updates.",

        "abstract": "Deep learning has achieved strong performance for electrocardiogram (ECG) classification within individual datasets, yet dependable generalization across heterogeneous acquisition settings remains a major obstacle to clinical deployment and longitudinal monitoring. A key limitation of many model architectures is the implicit entanglement of morphological waveform patterns and rhythm dynamics, which can promote shortcut learning and amplify sensitivity to distribution shifts. We propose ECG-RAMBA, a framework that separates morphology and rhythm and then re-integrates them through context-aware fusion. ECG-RAMBA combines: (i) deterministic morphological features extracted by MiniRocket, (ii) global rhythm descriptors computed from heart-rate variability (HRV), and (iii) long-range contextual modeling via a bi-directional Mamba backbone. To improve sensitivity to transient abnormalities under windowed inference, we introduce a numerically stable Power Mean pooling operator ($Q=3$) that emphasizes high-evidence segments while avoiding the brittleness of max pooling and the dilution of averaging. We evaluate under a protocol-faithful setting with subject-level cross-validation, a fixed decision threshold, and no test-time adaptation. On the Chapman--Shaoxing dataset, ECG-RAMBA achieves a macro ROC-AUC $\\approx 0.85$. In zero-shot transfer, it attains PR-AUC $=0.708$ for atrial fibrillation detection on the external CPSC-2021 dataset, substantially outperforming a comparable raw-signal Mamba baseline, and shows consistent cross-dataset performance on PTB-XL. Ablation studies indicate that deterministic morphology provides a strong foundation, while explicit rhythm modeling and long-range context are critical drivers of cross-domain robustness.",

In comparison, existing proximal policy methods such as GRPO or CISPO use multiple gradient steps with variants of importance ratio clipping to approximate a natural gradient step relative to a reference policy. In its simplest form, ISOPO normalizes the log-probability gradient of each sequence in the Fisher metric before contracting with the advantages. Another variant of ISOPO transforms the microbatch advantages based on the neural tangent kernel in each layer.

However, conventional velocity model building methods are often computationally expensive and time consuming. In recent years, with the rapid advancement of deep learning, particularly the success of generative models and neural operators, deep learning based approaches that integrate data and their statistics have attracted increasing attention in addressing the limitations of traditional methods. In this study, we propose a novel framework that combines generative models with neural operators to obtain high resolution velocity models efficiently. Within this workflow, the neural operator functions as a forward mapping operator to rapidly generate time lag reverse time migration (RTM) extended images from the true and migration velocity models. In this framework, the neural operator is acting as a surrogate for modeling followed by migration, which uses the true and migration velocities, respectively. The trained neural operator is then employed, through automatic differentiation, to gradually update the migration velocity placed in the true velocity input channel with high resolution components so that the output of the network matches the time lag images of observed data obtained using the migration velocity. By embedding a generative model, trained on a high-resolution velocity model distribution, which corresponds to the true velocity model distribution used to train the neural operator, as a regularizer, the resulting predictions are cleaner with higher resolution information. Both synthetic and field data experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed generative neural operator based velocity model building approach.",

In this context, methods developed for the non-blind case cannot be adapted in a straightforward manner. Recently, data-driven approaches have been proposed to address blind inverse problems, demonstrating strong empirical performance and adaptability. However, these methods often lack interpretability and are not supported by rigorous theoretical guarantees, limiting their reliability in applied domains such as imaging inverse problems. In this work, we shed light on learning in blind inverse problems within the simplified yet insightful framework of Linear Minimum Mean Square Estimators (LMMSEs). We provide an in-depth theoretical analysis, deriving closed-form expressions for optimal estimators and extending classical results. In particular, we establish equivalences with suitably chosen Tikhonov-regularized formulations, where the regularization depends explicitly on the distributions of the unknown signal, the noise, and the random forward operators. We also prove convergence results under appropriate source condition assumptions. Furthermore, we derive rigorous finite-sample error bounds that characterize the performance of learned estimators as a function of the noise level, problem conditioning, and number of available samples. These bounds explicitly quantify the impact of operator randomness and reveal the associated convergence rates as this randomness vanishes. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings through illustrative numerical experiments that confirm the predicted convergence behavior.",

FgGSL employs a learnable, symmetric, feature-driven masking function to infer said complementary graphs, which are processed using pre-designed low- and high-pass graph filter banks. A label-based structural loss explicitly promotes the recovery of homophilic and heterophilic edges, enabling task-driven graph structure learning. We derive stability bounds for the structural loss and establish robustness guarantees for the filter banks under graph perturbations.

In this work, we propose a constructive approach to bypass this optimization bottleneck. By decoupling the solution geometry from the ambient search space, we empirically demonstrate across ResNet-50, ViT, and BERT that the classification head can be compressed by even huge factors of 16 with negligible performance degradation. This motivates Subspace-Native Distillation as a novel paradigm: by defining the target directly in this constructed subspace, we provide a stable geometric coordinate system for student models, potentially allowing them to circumvent the high-dimensional search problem entirely and realize the vision of Train Big, Deploy Small.",

Formally, DSC models the weight update as a residual trajectory within a Star- Shaped Domain, employing a Magnitude-Gated Simplex Interpolation to ensure continuity at the identity. Unlike standard Mixture-of-LoRAs, which incurs O(M rd) parameter complexity by retrieving independent rank-r matrices, DSC constructs a compositional rank-K approximation from decoupled unit-norm basis vectors. This reduces parameter complexity to O(M d) and memory traffic to O(Kd), while Frame-Theoretic regularization and spectral constraints provide rigorous worst-case bounds on the dynamic update.

This trade-off hampers the ability of PEFT methods to capture complex patterns needed for diverse tasks. To address these challenges, we propose FRoD, a novel fine-tuning method that combines hierarchical joint decomposition with rotational degrees of freedom. By extracting a globally shared basis across layers and injecting sparse, learnable perturbations into scaling factors for flexible full-rank updates, FRoD enhances expressiveness and efficiency, leading to faster and more robust convergence. On 20 benchmarks spanning vision, reasoning, and language understanding, FRoD matches full model fine-tuning in accuracy, while using only 1.72% of trainable parameters under identical training budgets.",

We demonstrate that this approach is fundamentally flawed: when domains are unequally informative (e.g., high-quality vs degraded sensors), strict invariance necessitates information destruction, causing \"negative transfer\" that can be catastrophic in safety-critical applications [Wang et al., 2019]. We propose a decision-theoretic framework grounded in Le Cam's theory of statistical experiments [Le Cam, 1986], using constructive approximations to replace symmetric invariance with directional simulability. We introduce Le Cam Distortion, quantified by the Deficiency Distance $\\delta(E_1, E_2)$, as a rigorous upper bound for transfer risk conditional on simulability. Our framework enables transfer without source degradation by learning a kernel that simulates the target from the source. Across five experiments (genomics, vision, reinforcement learning), Le Cam Distortion achieves: (1) near-perfect frequency estimation in HLA genomics (correlation $r=0.999$, matching classical methods), (2) zero source utility loss in CIFAR-10 image classification (81.2% accuracy preserved vs 34.7% drop for CycleGAN), and (3) safe policy transfer in RL control where invariance-based methods suffer catastrophic collapse. Le Cam Distortion provides the first principled framework for risk-controlled transfer learning in domains where negative transfer is unacceptable: medical imaging, autonomous systems, and precision medicine.",

        "abstract": "We introduce a training-efficient framework for time-series learning that combines random features with controlled differential equations (CDEs). In this approach, large randomly parameterized CDEs act as continuous-time reservoirs, mapping input paths to rich representations. Only a linear readout layer is trained, resulting in fast, scalable models with strong inductive bias. Building on this foundation, we propose two variants: (i) Random Fourier CDEs (RF-CDEs): these lift the input signal using random Fourier features prior to the dynamics, providing a kernel-free approximation of RBF-enhanced sequence models; (ii) Random Rough DEs (R-RDEs): these operate directly on rough-path inputs via a log-ODE discretization, using log-signatures to capture higher-order temporal interactions while remaining stable and efficient. We prove that in the infinite-width limit, these model induces the RBF-lifted signature kernel and the rough signature kernel, respectively, offering a unified perspective on random-feature reservoirs, continuous-time deep architectures, and path-signature theory. We evaluate both models across a range of time-series benchmarks, demonstrating competitive or state-of-the-art performance. These methods provide a practical alternative to explicit signature computations, retaining their inductive bias while benefiting from the efficiency of random features.",

Under this formulation, we only use a standard architecture -- a Transformer with sliding-window attention. However, our model continues learning at test time via next-token prediction on the given context, compressing the context it reads into its weights. In addition, we improve the model's initialization for learning at test time via meta-learning at training time. Overall, our method, a form of Test-Time Training (TTT), is End-to-End (E2E) both at test time (via next-token prediction) and training time (via meta-learning), in contrast to previous forms. We conduct extensive experiments with a focus on scaling properties. In particular, for 3B models trained with 164B tokens, our method (TTT-E2E) scales with context length in the same way as Transformer with full attention, while others, such as Mamba 2 and Gated DeltaNet, do not. However, similar to RNNs, TTT-E2E has constant inference latency regardless of context length, making it 2.7 times faster than full attention for 128K context. Our code is publicly available.",

        "abstract": "AI co-scientists are emerging as a tool to assist human researchers in achieving their research goals. A crucial feature of these AI co-scientists is the ability to generate a research plan given a set of aims and constraints. The plan may be used by researchers for brainstorming, or may even be implemented after further refinement. However, language models currently struggle to generate research plans that follow all constraints and implicit requirements. In this work, we study how to leverage the vast corpus of existing research papers to train language models that generate better research plans. We build a scalable, diverse training corpus by automatically extracting research goals and goal-specific grading rubrics from papers across several domains. We then train models for research plan generation via reinforcement learning with self-grading. A frozen copy of the initial policy acts as the grader during training, with the rubrics creating a generator-verifier gap that enables improvements without external human supervision. To validate this approach, we conduct a study with human experts for machine learning research goals, spanning 225 hours. The experts prefer plans generated by our finetuned Qwen3-30B-A3B model over the initial model for 70% of research goals, and approve 84% of the automatically extracted goal-specific grading rubrics. To assess generality, we also extend our approach to research goals from medical papers, and new arXiv preprints, evaluating with a jury of frontier models. Our finetuning yields 12-22% relative improvements and significant cross-domain generalization, proving effective even in problem settings like medical research where execution feedback is infeasible. Together, these findings demonstrate the potential of a scalable, automated training recipe as a step towards improving general AI co-scientists.",

Decentralized foundation model training across edge devices, leveraging their spare compute, promises a democratized alternative. However, existing edge-training approaches fall short: they struggle to match cloud-based training performance, exhibit limited scalability with model size, exceed device memory capacity, and have prohibitive communication overhead. They also fail to satisfactorily handle device heterogeneity and dynamism. We introduce a new paradigm, Cleave, which finely partitions training operations through a novel selective hybrid tensor parallelism method. Together with a parameter server centric training framework, Cleave copes with device memory limits and avoids communication bottlenecks, thereby enabling efficient training of large models on par with the cloud. Further, with a cost optimization model to guide device selection and training workload distribution, Cleave effectively accounts for device heterogeneity and churn. Our evaluations show that Cleave matches cloud-based GPU training by scaling efficiently to larger models and thousands of devices, supporting up to 8x more devices than baseline edge-training approaches. It outperforms state-of-the-art edge training methods by up to a factor of 10 in per-batch training time and efficiently handles device failures, achieving at least 100x faster recovery than prior methods.",

We present UniFi, the first Wi-Fi-based ISAC framework that fully eliminates intrusive packet injection by directly exploiting irregularly sampled CSI from diverse communication packets across multiple frequency bands. UniFi integrates a CSI sanitization pipeline to harmonize heterogeneous packets and remove burst-induced redundancy, together with a time-aware attention model that learns directly from non-uniform CSI sequences without resampling. We further introduce CommCSI-HAR, the first dataset with irregularly sampled CSI from real-world dual-band communication traffic.

In this study, we propose an EEG-to-Voice paradigm that directly reconstructs speech from non-invasive EEG signals without dynamic time warping (DTW) or explicit temporal alignment. The proposed pipeline generates mel-spectrograms from EEG in an open-loop manner using a subject-specific generator, followed by pretrained vocoder and automatic speech recognition (ASR) modules to synthesize speech waveforms and decode text. Separate generators were trained for spoken speech and imagined speech, and transfer learning-based domain adaptation was applied by pretraining on spoken speech and adapting to imagined speech. A minimal language model-based correction module was optionally applied to correct limited ASR errors while preserving semantic structure. The framework was evaluated under 2 s and 4 s speech conditions using acoustic-level metrics (PCC, RMSE, MCD) and linguistic-level metrics (CER, WER). Stable acoustic reconstruction and comparable linguistic accuracy were observed for both spoken speech and imagined speech. While acoustic similarity decreased for longer utterances, text-level decoding performance was largely preserved, and word-position analysis revealed a mild increase in decoding errors toward later parts of sentences. The language model-based correction consistently reduced CER and WER without introducing semantic distortion. These results demonstrate the feasibility of direct, open-loop EEG-to-Voice reconstruction for spoken speech and imagined speech without explicit temporal alignment.",

The models were systematically trained and tested using data collected from IoT sensors of various environmental parameters like CO2, light. The experimental setup features 21 basil crops and uses Raspberry Pi and Arduino. 10k data points were collected and used to train and evaluate three ML models: Linear Regression (LR), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Deep Neural Networks (DNN). The comparative analysis of the performance of each model revealed that, while LSTM showed high predictive capability and accuracy of 99%, its execution time was 10 times longer than LR and its RAM usage was about 3 times higher than DNN's when simulated on a standard CPU environment. Conversely, the DNN model had an accuracy rate of 98%. This proves an efficient balance between computational speed and prediction quality, which makes this model well-suited for real-life deployment. Moreover, LR excelled in fast processing of basic prediction with an execution time of 11 seconds. This makes the LR model more suitable for low-complexity or resource-limited applications.

Lightweight deep learning models have shown promise, yet many either rely solely on local convolutions or require heavy recurrent modules. This paper presents PaperNet, a compact hybrid architecture that combines temporal convolutions, a channel-wise residual attention module, and a lightweight bidirectional recurrent block which is used for short-window classification. Using the publicly available BEED: Bangalore EEG Epilepsy Dataset, we evaluate PaperNet under a clearly defined subject-independent training protocol and compare it against established and widely used lightweight baselines. The model achieves a macro-F1 of 0.96 on the held-out test set with approximately 0.6M parameters, while maintaining balanced performance across all four classes. An ablation study demonstrates the contribution of temporal convolutions, residual attention, and recurrent aggregation. Channel-wise attention weights further offer insights into electrode relevance. Computational profiling shows that PaperNet remains efficient enough for practical deployment on resource-constrained systems through out the whole process. These results indicate that carefully combining temporal filtering, channel reweighting, and recurrent context modeling can yield strong EEG classification performance without excessive computational cost.",

        "abstract": "We observe two major trends in LLM-based generative AI: (1) inference is becoming the dominant factor in terms of cost and power consumption, surpassing training, and (2) retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is becoming prevalent. When processing long inputs in RAG, the prefill phase of computing the key-value vectors of input text is energy-intensive and time-consuming even with high-end GPUs. Thus, it is crucial to make the prefill phase in RAG inference efficient. To address this issue, we propose MatKV, a scheme that precomputes the key-value vectors (KVs) of RAG objects (e.g., documents), materializes them in inexpensive but fast and power-efficient flash storage, and reuses them at inference time instead of recomputing the KVs using costly and power-inefficient GPU. Experimental results using Hugging Face's Transformers library across state-of-the-art GPUs and flash memory SSDs confirm that, compared to full KV computation on GPUs, MatKV reduces both inference time and power consumption by half for RAG workloads, without severely impacting accuracy in the question-answering task. Furthermore, we demonstrate that MatKV enables additional optimizations in two ways. First, a GPU can decode text while simultaneously loading the materialized KVs for the next instance, reducing load latency. Second, since decoding speed is less sensitive to GPU performance than KV computation, low-end GPUs can be leveraged for decoding without significantly compromising speed once the materialized KVs are loaded into GPU memory. These findings underscore MatKV's potential to make large-scale generative AI applications more cost-effective, power-efficient, and accessible across a wider range of tasks and hardware environments.",

We bin proceedings by decade with dynamic merging for low-resource slices, train skip-gram embeddings, align spaces through orthogonal Procrustes, and measure both geometric displacement and neighborhood turnover. Three visual analytics outputs, which are drift magnitudes, semantic trajectories, and movement along a mercy-versus-retribution axis, expose how justice, crime, poverty, and insanity evolve with penal reforms, transportation debates, and Victorian moral politics.

        "abstract": "Modern deep residual networks perform substantial redundant computation by evaluating all residual blocks for every input, even when identity mappings suffice. We introduce CosineGate, an end-to-end differentiable architecture for dynamic routing in residual networks that uses cosine incompatibility between identity and residual feature representations as a self-supervised skip signal. CosineGate measures semantic redundancy through the Cosine Incompatibility Ratio (CIR), defined as 1 - cos(x, F(x)), and uses Gumbel-Softmax relaxation to enable per-sample, per-block gating during training. A progressive FLOPs regularization term controls average compute usage without destabilizing optimization. On CIFAR-10, CosineGate spans the accuracy-efficiency Pareto frontier: an aggressive configuration achieves 89.9 percent accuracy with 24.1 percent FLOPs savings, a balanced configuration achieves 91.3 percent accuracy with 28.5 percent savings at epoch 160, and a conservative configuration reaches a peak of 93.2 percent accuracy with minimal compute reduction. These results match or exceed ResNet-20 (91.3 percent) while reducing computation, without auxiliary supervision, distillation, or task-specific heuristics. Our results demonstrate that simple geometric measures of feature incompatibility provide a principled and effective signal for dynamic residual routing.",

The MPK compiler lowers tensor programs into highly optimized SM-level task graphs and generates optimized CUDA implementations for all tasks, while the MPK in-kernel parallel runtime executes these tasks within a single mega-kernel using decentralized scheduling across SMs. Together, these components provide end-to-end kernel fusion with minimal developer effort, while preserving the flexibility of existing programming models. Our evaluation shows that MPK significantly outperforms existing kernel-per-operator LLM serving systems by reducing end-to-end inference latency by up to 1.7x, pushing LLM inference performance close to hardware limits.

In this work, we investigate whether sentence embeddings encode a graded, hierarchical structure aligned with human-interpretable cognitive or psychological attributes. We construct a dataset of 480 natural-language sentences annotated with continuous ordinal energy scores and discrete tier labels spanning seven ordered cognitive categories. Using fixed sentence embeddings from multiple transformer models, we evaluate the recoverability of these annotations via linear and shallow nonlinear probes. Across models, both continuous scores and tier labels are reliably decodable, with shallow nonlinear probes providing consistent performance gains over linear probes. Lexical TF-IDF baselines perform substantially worse, indicating that the observed structure is not attributable to surface word statistics alone. Nonparametric permutation tests further confirm that probe performance exceeds chance under label-randomization nulls. Qualitative analyses using UMAP visualizations and confusion matrices reveal smooth low-to-high gradients and predominantly adjacent-tier confusions in embedding space. Taken together, these results provide evidence that transformer embedding spaces exhibit a hierarchical geometric organization aligned with human-defined cognitive attributes, while remaining agnostic to claims of internal awareness or phenomenology.",

We develop a statistical framework to assess the role of skill in determining success on these platforms. We construct and analyze a range of deterministic and stochastic team selection strategies, based on recent form, historical statistics, statistical optimization, and multi-criteria decision making. Strategy performance is evaluated based on points, ranks, and payoff under two contest structures Mega and 4x or Nothing. An extensive comparison between different strategies is made to find an optimal set of strategies. To capture adaptive behavior, we further introduce a dynamic tournament model in which agent populations evolve through a softmax reweighting mechanism proportional to positive payoff realizations. We demonstrate our work by running extensive numerical experiments on the IPL 2024 dataset.

Using two pharmacologic logic compliance tasks, we benchmark LSP against zero shot prompting, chain of thought prompting, and concise prompting across three open weight models: Gemma 2, Mistral, and Llama 3. Across both tasks and all models, LSP consistently achieves the highest accuracy (0.83 to 0.89) and F1 score (0.83 to 0.89), substantially outperforming zero shot prompting (0.24 to 0.60), concise prompts (0.16 to 0.30), and chain of thought prompting (0.56 to 0.75).

From spiral galaxies to the unfolding of leaves, this humble sequence reflects a universal grammar of balance. In this work, we introduce \\emph{Fibonacci Ensembles}, a mathematically principled yet philosophically inspired framework for ensemble learning that complements and extends classical aggregation schemes such as bagging, boosting, and random forests \\citep{Breiman1996Bagging, Breiman2001RandomForests, Friedman2001GBM, Zhou2012Ensemble, HastieTibshiraniFriedman2009ESL}. Two intertwined formulations unfold: (1) the use of normalized Fibonacci weights -- tempered through orthogonalization and Rao--Blackwell optimization -- to achieve systematic variance reduction among base learners, and (2) a second-order recursive ensemble dynamic that mirrors the Fibonacci flow itself, enriching representational depth beyond classical boosting. The resulting methodology is at once rigorous and poetic: a reminder that learning systems flourish when guided by the same intrinsic harmonies that shape the natural world. Through controlled one-dimensional regression experiments using both random Fourier feature ensembles \\citep{RahimiRecht2007RFF} and polynomial ensembles, we exhibit regimes in which Fibonacci weighting matches or improves upon uniform averaging and interacts in a principled way with orthogonal Rao--Blackwellization. These findings suggest that Fibonacci ensembles form a natural and interpretable design point within the broader theory of ensemble learning.",

        "abstract": "Ensemble learning is traditionally justified as a variance-reduction strategy, explaining its strong performance for unstable predictors such as decision trees. This explanation, however, does not account for ensembles constructed from intrinsically stable estimators-including smoothing splines, kernel ridge regression, Gaussian process regression, and other regularized reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) methods whose variance is already tightly controlled by regularization and spectral shrinkage. This paper develops a general weighting theory for ensemble learning that moves beyond classical variance-reduction arguments. We formalize ensembles as linear operators acting on a hypothesis space and endow the space of weighting sequences with geometric and spectral constraints. Within this framework, we derive a refined bias-variance approximation decomposition showing how non-uniform, structured weights can outperform uniform averaging by reshaping approximation geometry and redistributing spectral complexity, even when variance reduction is negligible. Our main results provide conditions under which structured weighting provably dominates uniform ensembles, and show that optimal weights arise as solutions to constrained quadratic programs. Classical averaging, stacking, and recently proposed Fibonacci-based ensembles appear as special cases of this unified theory, which further accommodates geometric, sub-exponential, and heavy-tailed weighting laws. Overall, the work establishes a principled foundation for structure-driven ensemble learning, explaining why ensembles remain effective for smooth, low-variance base learners and setting the stage for distribution-adaptive and dynamically evolving weighting schemes developed in subsequent work.",

This study proposes the creation of a model that allows the classification of people's emotions based on their EEG signals, for which the brain-computer interface EMOTIV EPOC was used. This allowed the collection of electroencephalographic information from 50 people, all of whom were shown audiovisual resources that helped to provoke the desired mood. The information obtained was stored in a database for the generation of the model and the corresponding classification analysis. Random Forest model was created for emotion prediction (happiness, sadness and relaxation), based on the signals of any person. The results obtained were 97.21% accurate for happiness, 76% for relaxation and 76% for sadness. Finally, the model was used to generate a real-time emotion prediction algorithm; it captures the person's EEG signals, executes the generated algorithm and displays the result on the screen with the help of images representative of each emotion.",

        "abstract": "We introduce the Self-Evaluating Model (Self-E), a novel, from-scratch training approach for text-to-image generation that supports any-step inference. Self-E learns from data similarly to a Flow Matching model, while simultaneously employing a novel self-evaluation mechanism: it evaluates its own generated samples using its current score estimates, effectively serving as a dynamic self-teacher. Unlike traditional diffusion or flow models, it does not rely solely on local supervision, which typically necessitates many inference steps. Unlike distillation-based approaches, it does not require a pretrained teacher. This combination of instantaneous local learning and self-driven global matching bridges the gap between the two paradigms, enabling the training of a high-quality text-to-image model from scratch that excels even at very low step counts. Extensive experiments on large-scale text-to-image benchmarks show that Self-E not only excels in few-step generation, but is also competitive with state-of-the-art Flow Matching models at 50 steps. We further find that its performance improves monotonically as inference steps increase, enabling both ultra-fast few-step generation and high-quality long-trajectory sampling within a single unified model. To our knowledge, Self-E is the first from-scratch, any-step text-to-image model, offering a unified framework for efficient and scalable generation.",

In this work, we propose PHANTOM, a physics-aware adversarial network that is trained and optimized through a multi-agent reinforcement learning model. PHANTOM integrates a physics-informed neural network (PINN) enabled by federated learning (FL) that functions as a digital twin of EVCS-integrated systems, ensuring physically consistent modeling of operational dynamics and constraints. Building on this digital twin, we construct a multi-agent RL environment that utilizes deep Q-networks (DQN) and soft actor-critic (SAC) methods to derive adversarial false data injection (FDI) strategies capable of bypassing conventional detection mechanisms. To examine the broader grid-level consequences, a transmission and distribution (T and D) dual simulation platform is developed, allowing us to capture cascading interactions between EVCS disturbances at the distribution level and the operations of the bulk transmission system. Results demonstrate how learned attack policies disrupt load balancing and induce voltage instabilities that propagate across T and D boundaries. These findings highlight the critical need for physics-aware cybersecurity to ensure the resilience of large-scale vehicle-grid integration.",

We printed and tested 155 specimens selected from a design space of 4,320 combinations using a Markforged Mark Two 3D printer. The processed data formed the input-output set for our proposed model. We compared the results with those from commonly used machine learning models, including feedforward neural networks, Kolmogorov-Arnold networks, XGBoost, CatBoost, and random forests. Our model achieved the lowest overall test error (MAPE = 12.33%) and showed statistically significant improvements over the baseline wide and deep neural network for several target variables (paired t-tests, p <= 0.05). SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis revealed that reinforcement strategy was the major influence on mechanical performance. Overall, this study demonstrates that the integration of LHS and SE-WDNN enables interpretable and sample-efficient multi-target predictions, guiding parameter selection in CFRC-AM with a balance between mechanical behavior and manufacturing metrics.",

LD-DIM couples a pretrained latent diffusion prior with an end-to-end differentiable numerical solver to reconstruct unknown heterogeneous parameter fields in a low-dimensional nonlinear manifold, improving numerical conditioning and enabling stable gradient-based optimization under sparse observations. The proposed framework integrates a latent diffusion model (LDM), trained in a compact latent space, with a differentiable finite-volume discretization of the forward PDE. Sensitivities are propagated through the discretization using adjoint-based gradients combined with reverse-mode automatic differentiation. Inversion is performed directly in latent space, which implicitly suppresses ill-conditioned degrees of freedom while preserving dominant structural modes, including sharp material interfaces. The effectiveness of LD-DIM is demonstrated using a representative inverse problem for flow in porous media, where heterogeneous conductivity fields are reconstructed from spatially sparse hydraulic head measurements. Numerical experiments assess convergence behavior and reconstruction quality for both Gaussian random fields and bimaterial coefficient distributions. The results show that LD-DIM achieves consistently improved numerical stability and reconstruction accuracy of both parameter fields and corresponding PDE solutions compared with physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and physics-embedded variational autoencoder (VAE) baselines, while maintaining sharp discontinuities and reducing sensitivity to initialization.",

Generic self-supervised learning (SSL) frameworks often yield suboptimal results on sEMG as they attempt to reconstruct noisy raw signals and lack the inductive bias to model the cylindrical topology of electrode arrays. To overcome these limitations, we introduce SPECTRE, a domain-specific SSL framework. SPECTRE features two primary contributions: a physiologically-grounded pre-training task and a novel positional encoding. The pre-training involves masked prediction of discrete pseudo-labels from clustered Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) representations, compelling the model to learn robust, physiologically relevant frequency patterns. Additionally, our Cylindrical Rotary Position Embedding (CyRoPE) factorizes embeddings along linear temporal and annular spatial dimensions, explicitly modeling the forearm sensor topology to capture muscle synergies. Evaluations on multiple datasets, including challenging data from individuals with amputation, demonstrate that SPECTRE establishes a new state-of-the-art for movement decoding, significantly outperforming both supervised baselines and generic SSL approaches. Ablation studies validate the critical roles of both spectral pre-training and CyRoPE.

Each party selects a real-valued policy vector as its strategy from a compact subset of Euclidean space, and a voter's utility for a policy is given by the inner product with their preference vector. To capture the uncertainty in the competition, we assume that a policy's winning probability increases monotonically with its total utility across all voters, and we formalize this via an affine isotonic function. A player's payoff is defined as the expected utility received by its supporters. In this work, we first test and validate the isotonicity hypothesis through voting simulations. Next, we prove the existence of a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium (PSNE) in both one- and multi-dimensional settings. Although we construct a counterexample demonstrating the game's non-monotonicity, our experiments show that a decentralized gradient-based algorithm typically converges rapidly to an approximate PSNE. Finally, we present a grid-based search algorithm that finds an $\\epsilon$-approximate PSNE of the game in time polynomial in the input size and $1/\\epsilon$.",

To address this, we introduce a framework that enhances the Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST) using Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM). Instead of merely minimizing the training loss, our approach optimizes the geometry of the loss surface, guiding the model toward flatter minima that generalize better to unseen patients. We also implement a weighted sampling strategy to handle class imbalance effectively. Our method achieves a state-of-the-art score of 68.10% on the ICBHI 2017 dataset, outperforming existing CNN and hybrid baselines. More importantly, it reaches a sensitivity of 68.31%, a crucial improvement for reliable clinical screening.

This paper develops a rigorous theory of likelihood-preserving embeddings: learned representations that can replace raw data in likelihood-based workflows -- hypothesis testing, confidence interval construction, model selection -- without altering inferential conclusions. We introduce the Likelihood-Ratio Distortion metric $\\Delta_n$, which measures the maximum error in log-likelihood ratios induced by an embedding. Our main theoretical contribution is the Hinge Theorem, which establishes that controlling $\\Delta_n$ is necessary and sufficient for preserving inference. Specifically, if the distortion satisfies $\\Delta_n = o_p(1)$, then (i) all likelihood-ratio based tests and Bayes factors are asymptotically preserved, and (ii) surrogate maximum likelihood estimators are asymptotically equivalent to full-data MLEs. We prove an impossibility result showing that universal likelihood preservation requires essentially invertible embeddings, motivating the need for model-class-specific guarantees. We then provide a constructive framework using neural networks as approximate sufficient statistics, deriving explicit bounds connecting training loss to inferential guarantees. Experiments on Gaussian and Cauchy distributions validate the sharp phase transition predicted by exponential family theory, and applications to distributed clinical inference demonstrate practical utility.",

        "abstract": "Clinical electroencephalography is routinely used to evaluate patients with diverse and often overlapping neurological conditions, yet interpretation remains manual, time-intensive, and variable across experts. While automated EEG analysis has been widely studied, most existing methods target isolated diagnostic problems, particularly seizure detection, and provide limited support for multi-disorder clinical screening. This study examines automated EEG-based classification across eleven clinically relevant neurological disorder categories, encompassing acute time-critical conditions, chronic neurocognitive and developmental disorders, and disorders with indirect or weak electrophysiological signatures. EEG recordings are processed using a standard longitudinal bipolar montage and represented through a multi-domain feature set capturing temporal statistics, spectral structure, signal complexity, and inter-channel relationships. Disorder-aware machine learning models are trained under severe class imbalance, with decision thresholds explicitly calibrated to prioritize diagnostic sensitivity. Evaluation on a large, heterogeneous clinical EEG dataset demonstrates that sensitivity-oriented modeling achieves recall exceeding 80% for the majority of disorder categories, with several low-prevalence conditions showing absolute recall gains of 15-30% after threshold calibration compared to default operating points. Feature importance analysis reveals physiologically plausible patterns consistent with established clinical EEG markers. These results establish realistic performance baselines for multi-disorder EEG classification and provide quantitative evidence that sensitivity-prioritized automated analysis can support scalable EEG screening and triage in real-world clinical settings.",

Catastrophe (CAT) bonds allow the transfer of part of this risk to investors, offering an alternative to traditional reinsurance. This paper examines the role of climate variability in CAT bond pricing and evaluates the predictive performance of various machine learning models in forecasting CAT bond coupons. We combine features typically used in the literature with a new set of climate indicators, including Oceanic Ni{ñ}o Index, Arctic Oscillation, North Atlantic Oscillation, Outgoing Longwave Radiation, Pacific-North American pattern, Pacific Decadal Oscillation, Southern Oscillation Index, and sea surface temperatures. We compare the performance of linear regression with several machine learning algorithms, such as random forest, gradient boosting, extremely randomized trees, and extreme gradient boosting. Our results show that including climate-related variables improves predictive accuracy across all models, with extremely randomized trees achieving the lowest root mean squared error (RMSE). These findings suggest that large-scale climate variability has a measurable influence on CAT bond pricing and that machine learning methods can effectively capture these complex relationships.",

        "abstract": "Structured width pruning of GLU-MLP layers, guided by the Maximum Absolute Weight (MAW) criterion, reveals a systematic dichotomy in how reducing the expansion ratio affects different model capabilities. While performance on tasks relying on parametric knowledge (e.g., MMLU, GSM8K) and perplexity metrics degrades predictably, instruction-following capabilities improve substantially (+46% to +75% in IFEval for Llama-3.2-1B and 3B models), and multi-step reasoning remains robust (MUSR). This pattern challenges the prevailing assumption that pruning induces uniform degradation. We evaluated seven expansion ratio configurations using comprehensive benchmarks assessing factual knowledge, mathematical reasoning, language comprehension, instruction-following, and truthfulness. Our analysis identifies the expansion ratio as a critical architectural parameter that selectively modulates cognitive capabilities, rather than merely serving as a compression metric. We provide the first systematic characterization of this selective preservation phenomenon. Notably, we document a robust inverse correlation (r = -0.864, p = 0.012 in Llama-3B) between factual knowledge capacity (MMLU) and truthfulness metrics (TruthfulQA-MC2): as knowledge degrades, the model's ability to discriminate misconceptions improves consistently. This connects two previously distinct research areas, demonstrating that MAW-guided width pruning acts as a selective filter, reducing parametric knowledge while preserving or enhancing behavioral alignment. Additionally, we quantify context-dependent efficiency trade-offs: pruned configurations achieve up to 23% reduction in energy consumption (J/token) but incur penalties in single-request latency, whereas batch processing workloads benefit uniformly.",

Although transformer-based architectures have proven to be effective in detecting hate and offensive speech, little has been done to apply them to hope speech or, more generally, to test them across a variety of linguistic settings. This paper presents a multilingual framework for hope speech detection with a focus on Urdu. Using pretrained transformer models such as XLM-RoBERTa, mBERT, EuroBERT, and UrduBERT, we apply simple preprocessing and train classifiers for improved results. Evaluations on the PolyHope-M 2025 benchmark demonstrate strong performance, achieving F1-scores of 95.2% for Urdu binary classification and 65.2% for Urdu multi-class classification, with similarly competitive results in Spanish, German, and English.

Despite ongoing efforts to understand the causes of negative pregnancy outcomes like miscarriage, stillbirths, birth defects, and premature birth, there is still a need for more comprehensive research and strategies for intervention. This paper introduces a novel approach that uses publicly available social media data, especially from platforms like Twitter, to enhance current datasets for studying negative pregnancy outcomes through observational research. The inherent challenges in utilizing social media data, including imbalance, noise, and lack of structure, necessitate robust preprocessing techniques and data augmentation strategies. By constructing a natural language processing (NLP) pipeline, we aim to automatically identify women sharing their pregnancy experiences, categorizing them based on reported outcomes. Women reporting full gestation and normal birth weight will be classified as positive cases, while those reporting negative pregnancy outcomes will be identified as negative cases. Furthermore, this study offers potential applications in assessing the causal impact of specific interventions, treatments, or prenatal exposures on maternal and fetal health outcomes. Additionally, it provides a framework for future health studies involving pregnant cohorts and comparator groups. In a broader context, our research showcases the viability of social media data as an adjunctive resource in epidemiological investigations about pregnancy outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Dynamical modeling of multisite human intracranial neural recordings is essential for developing neurotechnologies such as brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Linear dynamical models are widely used for this purpose due to their interpretability and their suitability for BCIs. In particular, these models enable flexible real-time inference, even in the presence of missing neural samples, which often occur in wireless BCIs. However, neural activity can exhibit nonlinear structure that is not captured by linear models. Furthermore, while recurrent neural network models can capture nonlinearity, their inference does not directly address handling missing observations. To address this gap, recent work introduced DFINE, a deep learning framework that integrates neural networks with linear state-space models to capture nonlinearities while enabling flexible inference. However, DFINE was developed for intracortical recordings that measure localized neuronal populations. Here we extend DFINE to modeling of multisite human intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings. We find that DFINE significantly outperforms linear state-space models (LSSMs) in forecasting future neural activity. Furthermore, DFINE matches or exceeds the accuracy of a gated recurrent unit (GRU) model in neural forecasting, indicating that a linear dynamical backbone, when paired and jointly trained with nonlinear neural networks, can effectively describe the dynamics of iEEG signals while also enabling flexible inference. Additionally, DFINE handles missing observations more robustly than the baselines, demonstrating its flexible inference and utility for BCIs. Finally, DFINE's advantage over LSSM is more pronounced in high gamma spectral bands. Taken together, these findings highlight DFINE as a strong and flexible framework for modeling human iEEG dynamics, with potential applications in next-generation BCIs.",

We observe data consisting of covariates, treatment assignments, and outcomes, where only the outcome corresponding to the assigned treatment is observed. The goal of policy learning is to train a policy from the observed data, where a policy is a function that recommends an optimal treatment for each individual, to maximize the policy value. In this study, we first show that maximizing the policy value is equivalent to minimizing the mean squared error for the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) under $\\{-1, 1\\}$ restricted regression models. Based on this finding, we modify the causal forest, an end-to-end CATE estimation algorithm, for policy learning. We refer to our algorithm as the causal-policy forest. Our algorithm has three advantages. First, it is a simple modification of an existing, widely used CATE estimation method, therefore, it helps bridge the gap between policy learning and CATE estimation in practice. Second, while existing studies typically estimate nuisance parameters for policy learning as a separate task, our algorithm trains the policy in a more end-to-end manner. Third, as in standard decision trees and random forests, we train the models efficiently, avoiding computational intractability.",

This paper presents a trust-based delegated consensus framework integrating Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) with Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) for privacy-preserving policy evaluation, combined with learning-based defense mechanisms. We systematically compare three reinforcement learning approaches -- tabular Q-learning (RL), Deep RL with Dueling Double DQN (DRL), and Multi-Agent RL (MARL) -- against five distinct attack families: Naive Malicious Attack (NMA), Collusive Rumor Attack (CRA), Adaptive Adversarial Attack (AAA), Byzantine Fault Injection (BFI), and Time-Delayed Poisoning (TDP). Experimental results on a 16-node simulated IoT network reveal significant performance variations: MARL achieves superior detection under collusive attacks (F1=0.85 vs. DRL's 0.68 and RL's 0.50), while DRL and MARL both attain perfect detection (F1=1.00) against adaptive attacks where RL fails (F1=0.50). All agents successfully defend against Byzantine attacks (F1=1.00). Most critically, the Time-Delayed Poisoning attack proves catastrophic for all agents, with F1 scores dropping to 0.11-0.16 after sleeper activation, demonstrating the severe threat posed by trust-building adversaries.

A key limitation of existing approaches like Ultra is their reliance on a single relational transformation (e.g., element-wise multiplication) in message passing, which can constrain expressiveness and fail to capture diverse relational and structural patterns exhibited on diverse graphs. In this paper, we propose Gamma, a novel foundation model that introduces multi-head geometric attention to knowledge graph reasoning. Gamma replaces the single relational transformation with multiple parallel ones, including real, complex, split-complex, and dual number based transformations, each designed to model different relational structures. A relational conditioned attention fusion mechanism then adaptively fuses them at link level via a lightweight gating with entropy regularization, allowing the model to robustly emphasize the most appropriate relational bias for each triple pattern. We present a full formalization of these algebraic message functions and discuss how their combination increases expressiveness beyond any single space. Comprehensive experiments on 56 diverse knowledge graphs demonstrate that Gamma consistently outperforms Ultra in zero-shot inductive link prediction, with a 5.5% improvement in mean reciprocal rank on the inductive benchmarks and a 4.4% improvement across all benchmarks, highlighting benefits from complementary geometric representations.",

This work investigates risk-averse online optimization in dynamic environments with varying risk levels, employing Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) as the risk measure. To capture the dynamics of the environment and risk levels, we employ the function variation metric and introduce a novel risk-level variation metric. Two information settings are considered: a first-order scenario, where the learner observes both function values and their gradients; and a zeroth-order scenario, where only function evaluations are available. For both cases, we develop risk-averse learning algorithms with a limited sampling budget and analyze their dynamic regret bounds in terms of function variation, risk-level variation, and the total number of samples. The regret analysis demonstrates the adaptability of the algorithms in non-stationary and risk-sensitive settings. Finally, numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the methods.",

We argue this metric confuses unfaithfulness with incompleteness, the lossy compression needed to turn distributed transformer computation into a linear natural language narrative. On multi-hop reasoning tasks with Llama-3 and Gemma-3, many CoTs flagged as unfaithful by Biasing Features are judged faithful by other metrics, exceeding 50% in some models. With a new faithful@k metric, we show that larger inference-time token budgets greatly increase hint verbalization (up to 90% in some settings), suggesting much apparent unfaithfulness is due to tight token limits. Using Causal Mediation Analysis, we further show that even non-verbalized hints can causally mediate prediction changes through the CoT. We therefore caution against relying solely on hint-based evaluations and advocate a broader interpretability toolkit, including causal mediation and corruption-based metrics.",

The unaddressed inherent sparsity in data and models often results in overly dense models and poor generalizability under data and client participation heterogeneity. We propose FL with an L0 constraint on the density of non-zero parameters, achieved through a reparameterization using probabilistic gates and their continuous relaxation: originally proposed for sparsity in centralized machine learning. We show that the objective for L0 constrained stochastic minimization naturally arises from an entropy maximization problem of the stochastic gates and propose an algorithm based on federated stochastic gradient descent for distributed learning. We demonstrate that the target density (rho) of parameters can be achieved in FL, under data and client participation heterogeneity, with minimal loss in statistical performance for linear and non-linear models: Linear regression (LR), Logistic regression (LG), Softmax multi-class classification (MC), Multi-label classification with logistic units (MLC), Convolution Neural Network (CNN) for multi-class classification (MC). We compare the results with a magnitude pruning-based thresholding algorithm for sparsity in FL. Experiments on synthetic data with target density down to rho = 0.05 and publicly available RCV1, MNIST, and EMNIST datasets with target density down to rho = 0.005 demonstrate that our approach is communication-efficient and consistently better in statistical performance.",

Generative artificial intelligence offers a promising approach for \\textit{de novo} molecular design but typically requires large sets of molecules to learn from. To address this problem, we present a framework combining a variational autoencoder (VAE) with a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model to generate novel odorants from limited training sets of odor molecules. The self-supervised learning capabilities of the VAE allow it to learn SMILES grammar from ChemBL database, while its training objective is augmented with a loss term derived from an external QSAR model to structure the latent representation according to odor probability. While the VAE demonstrated high internal consistency in learning the QSAR supervision signal, validation against an external, unseen ground truth dataset (Unique Good Scents) confirms the model generates syntactically valid structures (100\\% validity achieved via rejection sampling) and 94.8\\% unique structures. The latent space is effectively structured by odor likelihood, evidenced by a Fréchet ChemNet Distance (FCD) of $\\approx$ 6.96 between generated molecules and known odorants, compared to $\\approx$ 21.6 for the ChemBL baseline. Structural analysis via Bemis-Murcko scaffolds reveals that 74.4\\% of candidates possess novel core frameworks distinct from the training data, indicating the model performs extensive chemical space exploration beyond simple derivatization of known odorants.

Second, treating response generation in isolation fails to leverage comparative information in pairwise data, leaving the model's capacity for intrinsic self-reflection untapped. To address it, we propose Intrinsic Self-reflective Preference Optimization (\\q), deriving a globally optimal policy conditioning on both context and alternative responses. We prove this formulation superior to DPO/RLHF while guaranteeing invariance to scalarization and reference choices. \\q~serves as a plug-and-play enhancement without architectural changes or inference overhead.

Traditional cybersecurity lacks ML-specific threat modeling for foundation, multimodal, and RAG systems. Objective: Characterize ML security risks by identifying dominant TTPs, vulnerabilities, and targeted lifecycle stages. Methods: We extract 93 threats from MITRE ATLAS (26), AI Incident Database (12), and literature (55), and analyze 854 GitHub/Python repositories. A multi-agent RAG system (ChatGPT-4o, temp 0.4) mines 300+ articles to build an ontology-driven threat graph linking TTPs, vulnerabilities, and stages. Results: We identify unreported threats including commercial LLM API model stealing, parameter memorization leakage, and preference-guided text-only jailbreaks. Dominant TTPs include MASTERKEY-style jailbreaking, federated poisoning, diffusion backdoors, and preference optimization leakage, mainly impacting pre-training and inference. Graph analysis reveals dense vulnerability clusters in libraries with poor patch propagation.

For linear regression, this problem was solved by treating the true input values as latent variables to be estimated alongside model parameters. In this paper, we show that neural networks suffer from the same attenuation bias and that the latent variable solution generalizes directly to neural networks. We introduce LatentNN, a method that jointly optimizes network parameters and latent input values by maximizing the joint likelihood of observing both inputs and outputs. We demonstrate the correction on one-dimensional regression, multivariate inputs with correlated features, and stellar spectroscopy applications. LatentNN reduces attenuation bias across a range of signal-to-noise ratios where standard neural networks show large bias. This provides a framework for improved neural network inference in the low signal-to-noise regime characteristic of astronomical data. This bias correction is most effective when measurement errors are less than roughly half the intrinsic data range; in the regime of very low signal-to-noise and few informative features.

Drawing on qualitative reports in autism research that are especially salient, we propose a computational account in which paralysis arises from convergence failure in a hierarchical decision process. We separate intent selection (what to pursue) from affordance selection (how to pursue the goal) and formalize commitment as inference under a mixture of reverse- and forward-Kullback-Leibler (KL) objectives. Reverse KL is mode-seeking and promotes rapid commitment, whereas forward KL is mode-covering and preserves multiple plausible goals or actions. In static and dynamic (drift-diffusion) models, forward-KL-biased inference yields slow, heavy-tailed response times and two distinct failure modes, intent saturation and affordance saturation, when values are similar. Simulations in multi-option tasks reproduce key features of decision inertia and shutdown, treating autism as an extreme regime of a general, inference-based, decision-making continuum.",

        "abstract": "Federated unlearning has become an attractive approach to address privacy concerns in collaborative machine learning, for situations when sensitive data is remembered by AI models during the machine learning process. It enables the removal of specific data influences from trained models, aligning with the growing emphasis on the \"right to be forgotten.\" While extensively studied in horizontal federated learning, unlearning in vertical federated learning (VFL) remains challenging due to the distributed feature architecture. VFL unlearning includes sample unlearning that removes specific data points' influence and label unlearning that removes entire classes. Since different parties hold complementary features of the same samples, unlearning tasks require cross-party coordination, creating computational overhead and complexities from feature interdependencies. To address such challenges, we propose FedORA (Federated Optimization for data Removal via primal-dual Algorithm), designed for sample and label unlearning in VFL. FedORA formulates the removal of certain samples or labels as a constrained optimization problem solved using a primal-dual framework. Our approach introduces a new unlearning loss function that promotes classification uncertainty rather than misclassification. An adaptive step size enhances stability, while an asymmetric batch design, considering the prior influence of the remaining data on the model, handles unlearning and retained data differently to efficiently reduce computational costs. We provide theoretical analysis proving that the model difference between FedORA and Train-from-scratch is bounded, establishing guarantees for unlearning effectiveness. Experiments on tabular and image datasets demonstrate that FedORA achieves unlearning effectiveness and utility preservation comparable to Train-from-scratch with reduced computation and communication overhead.",

        "abstract": "Optimization under heavy-tailed noise has become popular recently, since it better fits many modern machine learning tasks, as captured by empirical observations. Concretely, instead of a finite second moment on gradient noise, a bounded ${\\frak p}$-th moment where ${\\frak p}\\in(1,2]$ has been recognized to be more realistic (say being upper bounded by $\\sigma_{\\frak l}^{\\frak p}$ for some $\\sigma_{\\frak l}\\ge0$). A simple yet effective operation, gradient clipping, is known to handle this new challenge successfully. Specifically, Clipped Stochastic Gradient Descent (Clipped SGD) guarantees a high-probability rate ${\\cal O}(\\sigma_{\\frak l}\\ln(1/\\delta)T^{1/{\\frak p}-1})$ (resp. ${\\cal O}(\\sigma_{\\frak l}^2\\ln^2(1/\\delta)T^{2/{\\frak p}-2})$) for nonsmooth convex (resp. strongly convex) problems, where $\\delta\\in(0,1]$ is the failure probability and $T\\in\\mathbb{N}$ is the time horizon. In this work, we provide a refined analysis for Clipped SGD and offer two faster rates, ${\\cal O}(\\sigma_{\\frak l}d_{\\rm eff}^{-1/2{\\frak p}}\\ln^{1-1/{\\frak p}}(1/\\delta)T^{1/{\\frak p}-1})$ and ${\\cal O}(\\sigma_{\\frak l}^2d_{\\rm eff}^{-1/{\\frak p}}\\ln^{2-2/{\\frak p}}(1/\\delta)T^{2/{\\frak p}-2})$, than the aforementioned best results, where $d_{\\rm eff}\\ge1$ is a quantity we call the $\\textit{generalized effective dimension}$. Our analysis improves upon the existing approach on two sides: better utilization of Freedman's inequality and finer bounds for clipping error under heavy-tailed noise. In addition, we extend the refined analysis to convergence in expectation and obtain new rates that break the known lower bounds. Lastly, to complement the study, we establish new lower bounds for both high-probability and in-expectation convergence. Notably, the in-expectation lower bounds match our new upper bounds, indicating the optimality of our refined analysis for convergence in expectation.",

We hypothesize that these errors stem from the flexibility of general-purpose languages, which permits multiple valid approaches and requires implicit state management. To test this hypothesis, we introduce Anka, a domain-specific language (DSL) for data transformation pipelines designed with explicit, constrained syntax that reduces ambiguity in code generation. Despite having zero prior training exposure to Anka, Claude 3.5 Haiku achieves 99.9% parse success and 95.8% overall task accuracy across 100 benchmark problems. Critically, Anka demonstrates a 40 percentage point accuracy advantage over Python on multi-step pipeline tasks (100% vs. 60%), where Python's flexible syntax leads to frequent errors in operation sequencing and variable management. Cross-model validation with GPT-4o-mini confirms this advantage (+26.7 percentage points on multi-step tasks). Our results demonstrate that: (1) LLMs can learn novel DSLs entirely from in-context prompts, achieving near-native accuracy; (2) constrained syntax significantly reduces errors on complex tasks; and (3) domain-specific languages purposefully designed for LLM generation can outperform general-purpose languages on which the LLM has extensive training.

Low-rank adaptation methods such as LoRA operate under the assumption that task-relevant weight updates reside in a low-rank subspace, yet this subspace is learned implicitly from data in a black-box manner, offering no interpretability or direct control. We hypothesize that this difficulty stems from polysemanticity--individual dimensions encoding multiple entangled concepts. To address this, we leverage pre-trained Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to identify task-relevant features in a disentangled feature space, then construct an explicit, interpretable low-rank subspace to guide adapter initialization. We provide theoretical analysis proving that under monosemanticity assumptions, SAE-based subspace identification achieves arbitrarily small recovery error, while direct identification in polysemantic space suffers an irreducible error floor. On safety alignment, our method achieves up to 99.6% safety rate--exceeding full fine-tuning by 7.4 percentage points and approaching RLHF-based methods--while updating only 0.19-0.24% of parameters. Crucially, our method provides interpretable insights into the learned alignment subspace through the semantic grounding of SAE features.

        "abstract": "Given the central role of green e-molecule imports in the European energy transition, many studies optimize import pathways and identify a single cost-optimal solution. However, cost optimality is fragile, as real-world implementation depends on regulatory, spatial, and stakeholder constraints that are difficult to represent in optimization models and can render cost-optimal designs infeasible. To address this limitation, we generate a diverse set of near-cost-optimal alternatives within an acceptable cost margin using Modeling to Generate Alternatives, accounting for unmodeled uncertainties. Interpretable machine learning is then applied to extract insights from the resulting solution space. The approach is applied to hydrogen import pathways considering hydrogen, ammonia, methane, and methanol as carriers. Results reveal a broad near-optimal space with great flexibility: solar, wind, and storage are not strictly required to remain within 10% of the cost optimum. Wind constraints favor solar-storage methanol pathways, while limited storage favors wind-based ammonia or methane pathways.",

        "abstract": "We study visual representation learning from a structural and topological perspective. We begin from a single hypothesis: that visual understanding presupposes a semantic language for vision, in which many perceptual observations correspond to a small number of discrete semantic states. Together with widely assumed premises on transferability and abstraction in representation learning, this hypothesis implies that the visual observation space must be organized in a fiber bundle like structure, where nuisance variation populates fibers and semantics correspond to a quotient base space. From this structure we derive two theoretical consequences. First, the semantic quotient $X/G$ is not a submanifold of $X$ and cannot be obtained through smooth deformation alone, semantic invariance requires a non-homeomorphic, discriminative target, for example, supervision via labels, cross instance identification, or multimodal alignment that supplies explicit semantic equivalence. Second, we show that approximating the quotient also places structural demands on the model architecture. Semantic abstraction requires not only an external semantic target, but a representation mechanism capable of supporting topology change: an expand-and-snap process in which the manifold is first geometrically expanded to separate structure and then collapsed to form discrete semantic regions. We emphasize that these results are interpretive rather than prescriptive: the framework provides a topological lens that aligns with empirical regularities observed in large-scale discriminative and multimodal models, and with classical principles in statistical learning theory.",

However, there are numerous underlying challenges in realizing the advantages associated with BD-RIS, prompting the research community to actively investigate cutting-edge schemes and algorithms in this direction. Particularly, the passive beamforming design for BD-RIS under specific environmental conditions has become a major focus in this research area. In this article, we provide a systematic introduction to BD-RIS, elaborating on its functional principles concerning architectural design, promising advantages, and classification. Subsequently, we present recent advances and identify a series of challenges and opportunities. Additionally, we consider a specific case study where beamforming is designed using four different algorithms, and we analyze their performance with respect to sum rate and computation cost. To augment the beamforming capabilities in 6G BD-RIS with quantum enhancement, we analyze various hybrid quantum-classical machine learning (ML) models to improve beam prediction performance, employing real-world communication Scenario 8 from the DeepSense 6G dataset.

In the joint prediction task involving four sequential conditions--curing and cooling, storage, overloading, and ignition--GrainGNet reduces the mean squared error by 62.8% compared to the baseline graph U-Net model, with only a 5.2% increase in parameter count and an approximately sevenfold improvement in training efficiency. Furthermore, in the high-strain regions of debonding seams, the prediction error is further reduced by 33% compared to the second-best method, offering a computationally efficient and high-fidelity approach to evaluate motor structural safety.",

Consequently, comprehensive testing methodologies are essential to evaluate the performance of autonomous vehicles in diverse and complex real-world scenarios. This study focuses on the behaviour coverage analysis of a multi-agent system simulation designed for autonomous vehicle testing, and provides a systematic approach to measure and assess behaviour coverage within the simulation environment. By defining a set of driving scenarios, and agent interactions, we evaluate the extent to which the simulation encompasses a broad range of behaviours relevant to autonomous driving. Our findings highlight the importance of behaviour coverage in validating the effectiveness and robustness of autonomous vehicle systems. Through the analysis of behaviour coverage metrics and coverage-based testing, we identify key areas for improvement and optimization in the simulation framework. Thus, a Model Predictive Control (MPC) pedestrian agent is proposed, where its objective function is formulated to encourage \\textit{interesting} tests while promoting a more realistic behaviour than other previously studied pedestrian agents. This research contributes to advancing the field of autonomous vehicle testing by providing insights into the comprehensive evaluation of system behaviour in simulated environments.

To address this, we propose expert-router coupling (ERC) loss, a lightweight auxiliary loss that tightly couples the router's decisions with expert capabilities. Our approach treats each expert's router embedding as a proxy token for the tokens assigned to that expert, and feeds perturbed router embeddings through the experts to obtain internal activations. The ERC loss enforces two constraints on these activations: (1) Each expert must exhibit higher activation for its own proxy token than for the proxy tokens of any other expert. (2) Each proxy token must elicit stronger activation from its corresponding expert than from any other expert. These constraints jointly ensure that each router embedding faithfully represents its corresponding expert's capability, while each expert specializes in processing the tokens actually routed to it. The ERC loss is computationally efficient, operating only on n^2 activations, where n is the number of experts. This represents a fixed cost independent of batch size, unlike prior coupling methods that scale with the number of tokens (often millions per batch). Through pre-training MoE-LLMs ranging from 3B to 15B parameters and extensive analysis on trillions of tokens, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the ERC loss. Moreover, the ERC loss offers flexible control and quantitative tracking of expert specialization levels during training, providing valuable insights into MoEs.",

Existing factor-based methods typically reduce alphas to numerical time series, overlooking the semantic rationale that determines when a factor is economically relevant. We propose Alpha-R1, an 8B-parameter reasoning model trained via reinforcement learning for context-aware alpha screening. Alpha-R1 reasons over factor logic and real-time news to evaluate alpha relevance under changing market conditions, selectively activating or deactivating factors based on contextual consistency.

Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that this approach balances misspecification error, estimation variance, and non-stationarity, performing close to the best model in hindsight. Applying our method to 17 industry portfolio returns, we consistently outperform standard rolling-window benchmarks, improving out-of-sample $R^2$ by 14-23% on average. During NBER- designated recessions, improvements are substantial: our method achieves positive $R^2$ during the Gulf War recession while benchmarks are negative, and improves $R^2$ in absolute terms by at least 80bps during the 2001 recession as well as superior performance during the 2008 Financial Crisis.

We first apply our framework to quantify memorization in existing methods. Next, through controlled experiments with a latent vector-set (Vecset) diffusion model, we find that, on the data side, memorization depends on data modality, and increases with data diversity and finer-grained conditioning; on the modeling side, it peaks at a moderate guidance scale and can be mitigated by longer Vecsets and simple rotation augmentation. Together, our framework and analysis provide an empirical understanding of memorization in 3D generative models and suggest simple yet effective strategies to reduce it without degrading generation quality.

        "abstract": "We present a theory for simultaneous approximation of the score function and its derivatives, enabling the handling of data distributions with low-dimensional structure and unbounded support. Our approximation error bounds match those in the literature while relying on assumptions that relax the usual bounded support requirement. Crucially, our bounds are free from the curse of dimensionality. Moreover, we establish approximation guarantees for derivatives of any prescribed order, extending beyond the commonly considered first-order setting.",

        "abstract": "We present an online method for guaranteeing calibration of quantile forecasts at multiple quantile levels simultaneously. A sequence of $\\alpha$-level quantile forecasts is calibrated if the forecasts are larger than the target value at an $\\alpha$-fraction of time steps. We introduce a lightweight method called Multi-Level Quantile Tracker (MultiQT) that wraps around any existing point or quantile forecaster to produce corrected forecasts guaranteed to achieve calibration, even against adversarial distribution shifts, while ensuring that the forecasts are ordered -- e.g., the 0.5-level quantile forecast is never larger than the 0.6-level forecast. Furthermore, the method comes with a no-regret guarantee that implies it will not worsen the performance of an existing forecaster, asymptotically, with respect to the quantile loss. In experiments, we find that MultiQT significantly improves the calibration of real forecasters in epidemic and energy forecasting problems.",

        "abstract": "We introduce Iterated Bellman Calibration, a simple, model-agnostic, post-hoc procedure for calibrating off-policy value predictions in infinite-horizon Markov decision processes. Bellman calibration requires that states with similar predicted long-term returns exhibit one-step returns consistent with the Bellman equation under the target policy. We adapt classical histogram and isotonic calibration to the dynamic, counterfactual setting by repeatedly regressing fitted Bellman targets onto a model's predictions, using a doubly robust pseudo-outcome to handle off-policy data. This yields a one-dimensional fitted value iteration scheme that can be applied to any value estimator. Our analysis provides finite-sample guarantees for both calibration and prediction under weak assumptions, and critically, without requiring Bellman completeness or realizability.",

        "abstract": "Identifying specific and often complex behaviors from large language models (LLMs) in conversational settings is crucial for their evaluation. Recent work proposes novel techniques to find natural language prompts that induce specific behaviors from a target model, yet they are mainly studied in single-turn settings. In this work, we study behavior elicitation in the context of multi-turn conversations. We first offer an analytical framework that categorizes existing methods into three families based on their interactions with the target model: those that use only prior knowledge, those that use offline interactions, and those that learn from online interactions. We then introduce a generalized multi-turn formulation of the online method, unifying single-turn and multi-turn elicitation. We evaluate all three families of methods on automatically generating multi-turn test cases. We investigate the efficiency of these approaches by analyzing the trade-off between the query budget, i.e., the number of interactions with the target model, and the success rate, i.e., the discovery rate of behavior-eliciting inputs. We find that online methods can achieve an average success rate of 45/19/77% with just a few thousand queries over three tasks where static methods from existing multi-turn conversation benchmarks find few or even no failure cases. Our work highlights a novel application of behavior elicitation methods in multi-turn conversation evaluation and the need for the community to move towards dynamic benchmarks.",
