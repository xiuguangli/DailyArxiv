        "abstract": "The accurate solution of nonlinear hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) remains a central challenge in computational science due to the presence of steep gradients, discontinuities, and multiscale structures that make conventional discretization-based solvers computationally demanding. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) embed the governing equations into the learning process, enabling mesh-free solution of PDEs, yet they often struggle to capture steep gradients, discontinuities, and complex nonlinear wave interactions. To address these limitations, this study employs the Extended Physics-Informed Neural Network (XPINN) framework to solve the nonlinear Buckley-Leverett equation with a nonconvex flux function, which models immiscible two-phase flow in porous media. The computational domain is dynamically decomposed in space and time into evolving pre-shock and post-shock regions, allowing localized subnetworks to efficiently learn distinct flow behaviors. Coupling between subnetworks is achieved through the Rankine-Hugoniot jump condition, which enforces physically consistent flux continuity across the moving shock interface. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed XPINN approach accurately captures discontinuous saturation fronts and compound wave interactions without requiring artificial diffusion or entropy corrections. Compared to standard PINNs, the XPINN framework achieves superior stability, faster convergence, and enhanced resolution of nonlinear wave dynamics using smaller, domain-specific models with fewer trainable parameters, establishing it as an effective and scalable tool for solving challenging hyperbolic PDEs in multiphase flow problems.

State-of-the-art (SOTA) TRL methods transform raw GPS trajectories to grid or road trajectories to capture high-level travel semantics, i.e., regions and roads. However, they lose fine-grained spatial-temporal details as multiple GPS points are grouped into a single grid cell or road segment. To tackle this problem, we propose the BLUrred Encoding method, dubbed BLUE, which gradually reduces the precision of GPS coordinates to create hierarchical patches with multiple levels. The low-level patches are small and preserve fine-grained spatial-temporal details, while the high-level patches are large and capture overall travel patterns. To complement different patch levels with each other, our BLUE is an encoder-decoder model with a pyramid structure. At each patch level, a Transformer is used to learn the trajectory embedding at the current level, while pooling prepares inputs for the higher level in the encoder, and up-resolution provides guidance for the lower level in the decoder. BLUE is trained using the trajectory reconstruction task with the MSE loss. We compare BLUE with 8 SOTA TRL methods for 3 downstream tasks, the results show that BLUE consistently achieves higher accuracy than all baselines, outperforming the best-performing baselines by an average of 30.90%.

Existing methods for analyzing these biases in diffusion models either focus narrowly on predefined categories or depend on manual interpretation of latent directions. These constraints limit scalability and hinder the discovery of subtle or unanticipated patterns. We introduce SCALEX, a framework for scalable and automated exploration of diffusion model latent spaces. SCALEX extracts semantically meaningful directions from H-space using only natural language prompts, enabling zero-shot interpretation without retraining or labelling. This allows systematic comparison across arbitrary concepts and large-scale discovery of internal model associations. We show that SCALEX detects gender bias in profession prompts, ranks semantic alignment across identity descriptors, and reveals clustered conceptual structure without supervision. By linking prompts to latent directions directly, SCALEX makes bias analysis in diffusion models more scalable, interpretable, and extensible than prior approaches.",

        "abstract": "The integration of large language models (LLMs) into automated driving systems has opened new possibilities for reasoning and decision-making by transforming complex driving contexts into language-understandable representations. Recent studies demonstrate that fine-tuned LLMs can accurately predict vehicle trajectories and lane-change intentions by gathering and transforming data from surrounding vehicles. However, the robustness of such LLM-based prediction models for safety-critical driving systems remains unexplored, despite the increasing concerns about the trustworthiness of LLMs. This study addresses this gap by conducting a systematic vulnerability analysis of LLM-enabled vehicle trajectory prediction. We propose a one-feature differential evolution attack that perturbs a single kinematic feature of surrounding vehicles within the LLM's input prompts under a black-box setting. Experiments on the highD dataset reveal that even minor, physically plausible perturbations can significantly disrupt model outputs, underscoring the susceptibility of LLM-based predictors to adversarial manipulation. Further analyses reveal a trade-off between accuracy and robustness, examine the failure mechanism, and explore potential mitigation solutions. The findings provide the very first insights into adversarial vulnerabilities of LLM-driven automated vehicle models in the context of vehicular interactions and highlight the need for robustness-oriented design in future LLM-based intelligent transportation systems.",

        "abstract": "Probabilistic forecasting is not only a way to add more information to a prediction of the future, but it also builds on weaknesses in point prediction. Sudden changes in a time series can still be captured by a cumulative distribution function (CDF), while a point prediction is likely to miss it entirely. The modeling of CDFs within forecasts has historically been limited to parametric approaches, but due to recent advances, this no longer has to be the case. We aim to advance the fields of probabilistic forecasting and monotonic networks by connecting them and propose an approach that permits the forecasting of implicit, complete, and nonparametric CDFs. For this purpose, we propose an adaptation to deep lattice networks (DLN) for monotonically constrained simultaneous/implicit quantile regression in time series forecasting. Quantile regression usually produces quantile crossovers, which need to be prevented to achieve a legitimate CDF. By leveraging long short term memory units (LSTM) as the embedding layer, and spreading quantile inputs to all sub-lattices of a DLN with an extended output size, we can produce a multi-horizon forecast of an implicit CDF due to the monotonic constraintability of DLNs that prevent quantile crossovers. We compare and evaluate our approach's performance to relevant state of the art within the context of a highly relevant application of time series forecasting: Day-ahead, hourly forecasts of solar irradiance observations. Our experiments show that the adaptation of a DLN performs just as well or even better than an unconstrained approach. Further comparison of the adapted DLN against a scalable monotonic neural network shows that our approach performs better. With this adaptation of DLNs, we intend to create more interest and crossover investigations in techniques of monotonic neural networks and probabilistic forecasting.",

However, these models often produce chemically invalid molecules, which limits the usable scope of the learned chemical space and poses significant challenges for practical applications. To address this issue, we propose ChemFixer, a framework designed to correct invalid molecules into valid ones. ChemFixer is built on a transformer architecture, pre-trained using masking techniques, and fine-tuned on a large-scale dataset of valid/invalid molecular pairs that we constructed. Through comprehensive evaluations across diverse generative models, ChemFixer improved molecular validity while effectively preserving the chemical and biological distributional properties of the original outputs. This indicates that ChemFixer can recover molecules that could not be previously generated, thereby expanding the diversity of potential drug candidates. Furthermore, ChemFixer was effectively applied to a drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction task using limited data, improving the validity of generated ligands and discovering promising ligand-protein pairs. These results suggest that ChemFixer is not only effective in data-limited scenarios, but also extensible to a wide range of downstream tasks. Taken together, ChemFixer shows promise as a practical tool for various stages of deep learning-based drug discovery, enhancing molecular validity and expanding accessible chemical space.",

        "abstract": "Test-Time adaptation (TTA) has proven effective in mitigating performance drops under single-domain distribution shifts by updating model parameters during inference. However, real-world deployments often involve mixed distribution shifts, where test samples are affected by diverse and potentially conflicting domain factors, posing significant challenges even for SOTA TTA methods. A key limitation in existing approaches is their reliance on a unified adaptation path, which fails to account for the fact that optimal gradient directions can vary significantly across different domains. Moreover, current benchmarks focus only on synthetic or homogeneous shifts, failing to capture the complexity of real-world heterogeneous mixed distribution shifts. To address this, we propose MoETTA, a novel entropy-based TTA framework that integrates the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. Rather than enforcing a single parameter update rule for all test samples, MoETTA introduces a set of structurally decoupled experts, enabling adaptation along diverse gradient directions. This design allows the model to better accommodate heterogeneous shifts through flexible and disentangled parameter updates. To simulate realistic deployment conditions, we introduce two new benchmarks: potpourri and potpourri+. While classical settings focus solely on synthetic corruptions, potpourri encompasses a broader range of domain shifts--including natural, artistic, and adversarial distortions--capturing more realistic deployment challenges. Additionally, potpourri+ further includes source-domain samples to evaluate robustness against catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments across three mixed distribution shifts settings show that MoETTA consistently outperforms strong baselines, establishing SOTA performance and highlighting the benefit of modeling multiple adaptation directions via expert-level diversity.",

This paper introduces a compilation scheme that automatically generates scalable, high-performance microkernels by leveraging the MLIR dialects to bridge domain-level operations and processor capabilities. Our approach removes dependence on low-level libraries by enabling the compiler to auto-generate near-optimal code directly. At its core is a mechanism for composing nanokernels from low-level IR constructs with near-optimal register utilization, forming efficient microkernels tailored to each target. We implement this technique in an MLIR-based compiler supporting both vector and tile based CPU instructions. Experiments show that the generated nanokernels are of production-quality, and competitive with state-of-the-art microkernel libraries.",

Instead of a single softmax probability distribution, CREDIT predicts class-wise probability intervals that define a credal set, a convex set of probability distributions, for uncertainty quantification.

Instead, we rely on an indirect style where learning algorithms, like gradient descent, determine a neural network's function by learning from data. This indirect style is often a virtue; it empowers us to solve problems that were previously impossible. But it lacks discrete structure. We can't compile most algorithms into a neural network -- even if these algorithms could help the network learn. This limitation occurs because discrete algorithms are not obviously differentiable, making them incompatible with the gradient-based learning algorithms that determine a neural network's function. To address this, we introduce $\\textsf{Cajal}$: a typed, higher-order and linear programming language intended to be a minimal vehicle for exploring a direct style of programming neural networks. We prove $\\textsf{Cajal}$ programs compile to linear neurons, allowing discrete algorithms to be expressed in a differentiable form compatible with gradient-based learning. With our implementation of $\\textsf{Cajal}$, we conduct several experiments where we link these linear neurons against other neural networks to determine part of their function prior to learning. Linking with these neurons allows networks to learn faster, with greater data-efficiency, and in a way that's easier to debug. A key lesson is that linear programming languages provide a path towards directly programming neural networks, enabling a rich interplay between learning and the discrete structures of ordinary programming.",

This study examines whether larger models can systematically jailbreak smaller ones - eliciting harmful or restricted behavior despite alignment safeguards. Using standardized adversarial tasks from JailbreakBench, we simulate over 6,000 multi-turn attacker-target exchanges across major LLM families and scales (0.6B-120B parameters), measuring both harm score and refusal behavior as indicators of adversarial potency and alignment integrity. Each interaction is evaluated through aggregated harm and refusal scores assigned by three independent LLM judges, providing a consistent, model-based measure of adversarial outcomes. Aggregating results across prompts, we find a strong and statistically significant correlation between mean harm and the logarithm of the attacker-to-target size ratio (Pearson r = 0.51, p < 0.001; Spearman rho = 0.52, p < 0.001), indicating that relative model size correlates with the likelihood and severity of harmful completions. Mean harm score variance is higher across attackers (0.18) than across targets (0.10), suggesting that attacker-side behavioral diversity contributes more to adversarial outcomes than target susceptibility. Attacker refusal frequency is strongly and negatively correlated with harm (rho = -0.93, p < 0.001), showing that attacker-side alignment mitigates harmful responses. These findings reveal that size asymmetry influences robustness and provide exploratory evidence for adversarial scaling patterns, motivating more controlled investigations into inter-model alignment and safety.",

        "abstract": "Reinforcement learning(RL) post-training has become essential for aligning large language models (LLMs), yet its efficiency is increasingly constrained by the rollout phase, where long trajectories are generated token by token. We identify a major bottleneck:the long-tail distribution of rollout lengths, where a small fraction of long generations dominates wall clock time and a complementary opportunity; the availability of historical rollouts that reveal stable prompt level patterns across training epochs. Motivated by these observations, we propose DAS, a Distribution Aware Speculative decoding framework that accelerates RL rollouts without altering model outputs. DAS integrates two key ideas: an adaptive, nonparametric drafter built from recent rollouts using an incrementally maintained suffix tree, and a length aware speculation policy that allocates more aggressive draft budgets to long trajectories that dominate makespan. This design exploits rollout history to sustain acceptance while balancing base and token level costs during decoding. Experiments on math and code reasoning tasks show that DAS reduces rollout time up to 50% while preserving identical training curves, demonstrating that distribution-aware speculative decoding can significantly accelerate RL post training without compromising learning quality.",

Forecasting of energy mix and energy use decades ahead is nontrivial. Classical approaches focus on generating a finite number of scenarios (modeled as a mixture of Diracs in statistical theory terms), which limits insight into scenario-specific volatility and hinders robust decision-making. We propose an alternative using tractable probabilistic models (TPMs), particularly sum-product networks (SPNs). These models enable exact, scalable inference of key quantities such as scenario likelihoods, marginals, and conditional probabilities, supporting robust scenario expansion and risk assessment. This framework enables direct embedding of chance-constrained optimization into investment planning, enforcing safety or reliability with prescribed confidence levels. TPMs allow both scenario analysis and volatility quantification by compactly representing high-dimensional uncertainties. We demonstrate the approach's effectiveness through a representative power system planning case study, illustrating computational and reliability advantages over traditional scenario-based models.",

However, we argue that this conclusion is incomplete and overlooks the challenge of densely correlated datasets, where intricate dependencies can overwhelm statistical models. In such complex scenarios, neural networks are more suitable due to their capacity to fit complex distributions by learning directly from samples. Despite this potential, existing NN-based algorithms still suffer from significant limitations. We therefore propose MargNet, incorporating successful algorithmic designs of statistical models into neural networks. MargNet applies an adaptive marginal selection strategy and trains the neural networks to generate data that conforms to the selected marginals. On sparsely correlated datasets, our approach achieves utility close to the best statistical method while offering an average 7$\\times$ speedup over it. More importantly, on densely correlated datasets, MargNet establishes a new state-of-the-art, reducing fidelity error by up to 26\\% compared to the previous best.

To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework that equips graphs with a complex-weighted structure, assigning each edge a complex number to drive a diffusion process that extends random walks into the complex domain. We prove that this diffusion is highly expressive: with appropriately chosen complex weights, any node-classification task can be solved in the steady state of a complex random walk. Building on this insight, we propose the Complex-Weighted Convolutional Network (CWCN), which learns suitable complex-weighted structures directly from data while enriching diffusion with learnable matrices and nonlinear activations. CWCN is simple to implement, requires no additional hyperparameters beyond those of standard GNNs, and achieves competitive performance on benchmark datasets. Our results demonstrate that complex-weighted diffusion provides a principled and general mechanism for enhancing GNN expressiveness, opening new avenues for models that are both theoretically grounded and practically effective.",

Our results demonstrate that tuning the BR can yield significant improvements over the default: the best setup relied on BR \\leq 1.0 for 24 datasets, BR > 1.0 for 15, and BR = 1.0 was optimal in 4 cases only. We establish a link between dataset characteristics and the preferred BR: datasets with strong global feature-target relationships favor higher BRs, while those with higher local target variance benefit from lower BRs. To further investigate this relationship, we conducted experiments on synthetic datasets with controlled noise levels. These experiments reproduce the observed bias-variance trade-off: in low-noise scenarios, higher BRs effectively reduce model bias, whereas in high-noise settings, lower BRs help reduce model variance. Overall, BR is an influential hyperparameter that should be tuned to optimize RF regression models.",

Our approach proceeds in two stages. First, we introduce a semantically aware labeling algorithm that, given a generated SQL and a gold reference, assigns node-level correctness without over-penalizing structural containers or alias variation. Second, we represent each node with a rich set of schema-aware and lexical features - capturing identifier validity, alias resolution, type compatibility, ambiguity in scope, and typo signals - and train a supervised classifier to predict per-node error probabilities. We interpret these probabilities as calibrated uncertainty, enabling fine-grained diagnostics that pinpoint exactly where a query is likely to be wrong. Across multiple databases and datasets, our method substantially outperforms token log-probabilities: average AUC improves by +27.44% while maintaining robustness under cross-database evaluation. Beyond serving as an accuracy signal, node-level uncertainty supports targeted repair, human-in-the-loop review, and downstream selective execution. Together, these results establish node-centric, semantically grounded uncertainty estimation as a strong and interpretable alternative to aggregate sequence level confidence measures.",

We first consider the setting where the loss is non-smooth and the optimizer interacts with a private proxy oracle, which sends only private messages about a minibatch of gradients. In this setting, we show that expected running time $\\Omega(\\min\\{\\frac{\\sqrt{d}}{\\alpha^2}, \\frac{d}{\\log(1/\\alpha)}\\})$ is necessary to achieve $\\alpha$ excess risk on problems of dimension $d$ when $d \\geq 1/\\alpha^2$. Upper bounds via DP-SGD show these results are tight when $d>\\tilde{\\Omega}(1/\\alpha^4)$. We further show our lower bound can be strengthened to $\\Omega(\\min\\{\\frac{d}{\\bar{m}\\alpha^2}, \\frac{d}{\\log(1/\\alpha)} \\})$ for algorithms which use minibatches of size at most $\\bar{m} < \\sqrt{d}$. We next consider smooth losses, where we relax the private oracle assumption and give lower bounds under only the condition that the optimizer is private. Here, we lower bound the expected number of first order oracle calls by $\\tilde{\\Omega}\\big(\\frac{\\sqrt{d}}{\\alpha} + \\min\\{\\frac{1}{\\alpha^2}, n\\}\\big)$, where $n$ is the size of the dataset. Modifications to existing algorithms show this bound is nearly tight. Compared to non-private lower bounds, our results show that differentially private optimizers pay a dimension dependent runtime penalty. Finally, as a natural extension of our proof technique, we show lower bounds in the non-smooth setting for optimizers interacting with information limited oracles. Specifically, if the proxy oracle transmits at most $\\Gamma$-bits of information about the gradients in the minibatch, then $\\Omega\\big(\\min\\{\\frac{d}{\\alpha^2\\Gamma}, \\frac{d}{\\log(1/\\alpha)}\\}\\big)$ oracle calls are needed.

This paper introduces SmallML, a Bayesian transfer learning framework achieving enterprise-level prediction accuracy with datasets as small as 50-200 observations. We develop a three-layer architecture integrating transfer learning, hierarchical Bayesian modeling, and conformal prediction. Layer 1 extracts informative priors from 22,673 public records using a SHAP-based procedure transferring knowledge from gradient boosting to logistic regression. Layer 2 implements hierarchical pooling across J=5-50 SMEs with adaptive shrinkage, balancing population patterns with entity-specific characteristics. Layer 3 provides conformal sets with finite-sample coverage guarantees P(y in C(x)) >= 1-alpha for distribution-free uncertainty quantification. Validation on customer churn data demonstrates 96.7% +/- 4.2% AUC with 100 observations per business -- a +24.2 point improvement over independent logistic regression (72.5% +/- 8.1%), with p < 0.000001. Conformal prediction achieves 92% empirical coverage at 90% target. Training completes in 33 minutes on standard CPU hardware. By enabling enterprise-grade predictions for 33 million U.S. SMEs previously excluded from machine learning, SmallML addresses a critical gap in AI democratization.

Traditional motion analysis systems are often expensive and intrusive, limiting their use in natural training environments. To address this limitation, we propose a machine learning-based multimodal framework that integrates wearable sensor data for simultaneous action recognition and stress estimation. Using a self-developed wrist-worn device equipped with an accelerometer and photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor, we collected synchronized motion and physiological data during real archery sessions. For motion recognition, we introduce a novel feature--Smoothed Differential Acceleration (SmoothDiff)--and employ a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to identify motion phases, achieving 96.8% accuracy and 95.9% F1-score. For stress estimation, we extract heart rate variability (HRV) features from PPG signals and apply a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier, achieving 80% accuracy in distinguishing high- and low-stress levels. The proposed framework demonstrates that integrating motion and physiological sensing can provide meaningful insights into athletes' technical and mental states. This approach offers a foundation for developing intelligent, real-time feedback systems for training optimization in archery and other precision sports.",

        "abstract": "Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) has become a mainstream approach for simultaneously improving prompt fidelity and generation quality in conditional generative models. During training, CFG stochastically alternates between conditional and null prompts to enable both conditional and unconditional generation. However, during sampling, CFG outputs both null and conditional prompts simultaneously, leading to inconsistent noise estimates between the training and sampling processes. To reduce this error, we propose CFG-EC, a versatile correction scheme augmentable to any CFG-based method by refining the unconditional noise predictions. CFG-EC actively realigns the unconditional noise error component to be orthogonal to the conditional error component. This corrective maneuver prevents interference between the two guidance components, thereby constraining the sampling error's upper bound and establishing more reliable guidance trajectories for high-fidelity image generation. Our numerical experiments show that CFG-EC handles the unconditional component more effectively than CFG and CFG++, delivering a marked performance increase in the low guidance sampling regime and consistently higher prompt alignment across the board.",

However, these studies primarily focus on variations in environmental layouts while overlooking the impact of changes in device configurations, such as bandwidth, the number of access points (APs), and the number of antennas used. Unlike environmental changes, variations in device configurations affect the dimensionality of channel state information (CSI), thereby compromising neural network usability. To address this issue, we propose Meta-SimGNN, a novel WiFi localization system that integrates graph neural networks with meta-learning to improve localization generalization and robustness. First, we introduce a fine-grained CSI graph construction scheme, where each AP is treated as a graph node, allowing for adaptability to changes in the number of APs. To structure the features of each node, we propose an amplitude-phase fusion method and a feature extraction method. The former utilizes both amplitude and phase to construct CSI images, enhancing data reliability, while the latter extracts dimension-consistent features to address variations in bandwidth and the number of antennas. Second, a similarity-guided meta-learning strategy is developed to enhance adaptability in diverse scenarios. The initial model parameters for the fine-tuning stage are determined by comparing the similarity between the new scenario and historical scenarios, facilitating rapid adaptation of the model to the new localization scenario. Extensive experimental results over commodity WiFi devices in different scenarios show that Meta-SimGNN outperforms the baseline methods in terms of localization generalization and accuracy.",

        "abstract": "The immense memory requirements of state-of-the-art Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models present a significant challenge for inference, often exceeding the capacity of a single accelerator. While offloading experts to host memory is a common solution, it introduces a severe I/O bottleneck over the PCIe bus, as the data-dependent nature of expert selection places these synchronous transfers directly on the critical path of execution, crippling performance. This paper argues that the I/O bottleneck can be overcome by trading a small amount of cheap, on-device computation to hide the immense cost of data movement. We present MoE-SpeQ, a new inference system built on a novel co-design of speculative execution and expert offloading. MoE-SpeQ employs a small, on-device draft model to predict the sequence of required experts for future tokens. This foresight enables a runtime orchestrator to prefetch these experts from host memory, effectively overlapping the expensive I/O with useful computation and hiding the latency from the critical path. To maximize performance, an adaptive governor, guided by an Amortization Roofline Model, dynamically tunes the speculation strategy to the underlying hardware. Our evaluation on memory-constrained devices shows that for the Phi-MoE model, MoE-SpeQ achieves at most 2.34x speedup over the state-of-the-art offloading framework. Our work establishes a new, principled approach for managing data-dependent memory access in resource-limited environments, making MoE inference more accessible on commodity hardware.",

The need for answering such \"when-if\" questions--how the timing of an event would change under a specified intervention--commonly arises in real-world settings with heterogeneous treatment adoption and confounding. To address these challenges, we propose Synthetic Survival Control (SSC) to estimate counterfactual hazard trajectories in a panel data setting where multiple units experience potentially different treatments over multiple periods. In such a setting, SSC estimates the counterfactual hazard trajectory for a unit of interest as a weighted combination of the observed trajectories from other units. To provide formal justification, we introduce a panel framework with a low-rank structure for causal survival analysis. Indeed, such a structure naturally arises under classical parametric survival models. Within this framework, for the causal estimand of interest, we establish identification and finite sample guarantees for SSC. We validate our approach using a multi-country clinical dataset of cancer treatment outcomes, where the staggered introduction of new therapies creates a quasi-experimental setting. Empirically, we find that access to novel treatments is associated with improved survival, as reflected by lower post-intervention hazard trajectories relative to their synthetic counterparts. Given the broad relevance of survival analysis across medicine, economics, and public policy, our framework offers a general and interpretable tool for counterfactual survival inference using observational data.",

Existing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approaches steer fairness by shaping reward through post hoc orchestrations, leaving no certifiable self-enforceable fairness that is immutable by individual agents at runtime. Contextualized within a setting where each agent shares resources with others, we address this shortcoming with a learning enabled optimization scheme among self-interested decision makers whose individual actions affect those of other agents. This extends the problem to a generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) game-theoretic framework where we steer group policy to a safe and locally efficient equilibrium, so that no agent can improve its utility function by unilaterally changing its decisions. Fair-GNE models MARL as a constrained generalized Nash equilibrium-seeking (GNE) game, prescribing an ideal equitable collective equilibrium within the problem's natural fabric. Our hypothesis is rigorously evaluated in our custom-designed high-fidelity resuscitation simulator. Across all our numerical experiments, Fair-GNE achieves significant improvement in workload balance over fixed-penalty baselines (0.89 vs.\\ 0.33 JFI, $p < 0.01$) while maintaining 86\\% task success, demonstrating statistically significant fairness gains through adaptive constraint enforcement. Our results communicate our formulations, evaluation metrics, and equilibrium-seeking innovations in large multi-agent learning-based healthcare systems with clarity and principled fairness enforcement.",

This study highlights the need to address biases in LLMs amid growing generative AI. We studied bias-specific benchmarks such as StereoSet and CrowSPairs to evaluate the existence of various biases in multiple generative models such as BERT and GPT 3.5. We proposed an automated Bias-Identification Framework to recognize various social biases in LLMs such as gender, race, profession, and religion. We adopted a two-pronged approach to detect explicit and implicit biases in text data. Results indicated fine-tuned models struggle with gender biases but excelled at identifying and avoiding racial biases. Our findings illustrated that despite having some success, LLMs often over-relied on keywords. To illuminate the capability of the analyzed LLMs in detecting implicit biases, we employed Bag-of-Words analysis and unveiled indications of implicit stereotyping within the vocabulary. To bolster the model performance, we applied an enhancement strategy involving fine-tuning models using prompting techniques and data augmentation of the bias benchmarks. The fine-tuned models exhibited promising adaptability during cross-dataset testing and significantly enhanced performance on implicit bias benchmarks, with performance gains of up to 20%.",

It characterizes hidden layer dynamics by analyzing the APT (Angular-Probabilistic Trajectory) of latent representations and introducing the JSS (Jensen-Shannon Separability) metric. Experiments on over 40 models and 20 red teaming strategies demonstrate that the JSS metric exhibits high consistency with the safety rankings derived from Red Teaming.

        "abstract": "Deep neural networks achieve outstanding performance in visual recognition tasks, yet their large number of parameters makes them less practical for real-world applications. Recently, one-shot pruning has emerged as an effective strategy for reducing model size without additional training. However, models trained with standard objective functions often suffer a significant drop in accuracy after aggressive pruning. Some existing pruning-robust optimizers, such as SAM, and CrAM, mitigate this accuracy drop by guiding the model toward flatter regions of the parameter space, but they inevitably incur non-negligible additional computations. We propose a Variance Amplifying Regularizer (VAR) that deliberately increases the variance of model parameters during training. Our study reveals an intriguing finding that parameters with higher variance exhibit greater pruning robustness. VAR exploits this property by promoting such variance in the weight distribution, thereby mitigating the adverse effects of pruning. We further provide a theoretical analysis of its convergence behavior, supported by extensive empirical results demonstrating the superior pruning robustness of VAR.",

Small, imbalanced, and noisy datasets, coupled with high-dimensional and weakly identified clinical features, amplify this multiplicity and make conventional validation schemes unreliable. As a result, selecting among equally performing models becomes uncertain, particularly when resource constraints and operational priorities are not considered by conventional metrics like F1 score. To address these issues, we propose two complementary tools for robust model assessment and selection: Intervention Efficiency (IE) and the Perturbation Validation Framework (PVF). IE is a capacity-aware metric that quantifies how efficiently a model identifies actionable true positives when only limited interventions are feasible, thereby linking predictive performance with clinical utility. PVF introduces a structured approach to assess the stability of models under data perturbations, identifying models whose performance remains most invariant across noisy or shifted validation sets. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world healthcare datasets show that using these tools facilitates the selection of models that generalize more robustly and align with capacity constraints, offering a new direction for tackling the Rashomon Effect in clinical settings.",

The prevalent approach to handle this challenge is to aggregate a weighted combination of requirement violation penalties into the training objective. To be effective, this approach requires careful tuning of these hyperparameters (weights), involving trial-and-error and cross-validation, which becomes ineffective even for a moderate number of requirements. These issues are exacerbated when the requirements involve parities or equalities, as is the case in fairness and boundary value problems. An alternative technique uses constrained optimization to formulate these learning problems. Yet, existing approximation and generalization guarantees do not apply to problems involving equality constraints. In this work, we derive a generalization theory for equality-constrained statistical learning problems, showing that their solutions can be approximated using samples and rich parametrizations. Using these results, we propose a practical algorithm based on solving a sequence of unconstrained, empirical learning problems. We showcase its effectiveness and the new formulations enabled by equality constraints in fair learning, interpolating classifiers, and boundary value problems.",

In this paper, we identify this critical gap and introduce a simple, generalized, yet robust irreversibility-regularized strategy that enforces hidden physical laws as soft constraints during training. This approach ensures that the learned solutions consistently respect the intrinsic one-way nature of irreversible physical processes. Across a wide range of benchmarks spanning traveling wave propagation, steady combustion, ice melting, corrosion evolution, and crack propagation, we demonstrate that our regularization scheme reduces predictive errors by more than an order of magnitude, while requiring only minimal modification to existing PINN frameworks. We believe that the proposed framework is broadly applicable to a wide class of PDE-governed physical systems and will have significant impact within the scientific machine learning community.",

We present the first analysis of the influence of LoRA on state-of-the-art backdoor attacks targeting model adaptation in FL. Specifically, we focus on backdoor lifespan, a critical characteristic in FL, that can vary depending on the attack scenario and the attacker's ability to effectively inject the backdoor. A key finding in our experiments is that for an optimally injected backdoor, the backdoor persistence after the attack is longer when the LoRA's rank is lower. Importantly, our work highlights evaluation issues of backdoor attacks against FL and contributes to the development of more robust and fair evaluations of backdoor attacks, enhancing the reliability of risk assessments for critical FL systems.

        "abstract": "Recently, the general-to-customized paradigm has emerged as the dominant approach for Cross-Modal Retrieval (CMR), which reconciles the distribution shift problem between the source domain and the target domain. However, existing general-to-customized CMR methods typically assume that the entire target-domain data is available, which is easily violated in real-world scenarios and thus inevitably suffer from the query shift (QS) problem. Specifically, query shift embraces the following two characteristics and thus poses new challenges to CMR. i) Online Shift: real-world queries always arrive in an online manner, rendering it impractical to access the entire query set beforehand for customization approaches; ii) Diverse Shift: even with domain customization, the CMR models struggle to satisfy queries from diverse users or scenarios, leaving an urgent need to accommodate diverse queries. In this paper, we observe that QS would not only undermine the well-structured common space inherited from the source model, but also steer the model toward forgetting the indispensable general knowledge for CMR. Inspired by the observations, we propose a novel method for achieving online and harmonious adaptation against QS, dubbed Robust adaptation with quEry ShifT (REST). To deal with online shift, REST first refines the retrieval results to formulate the query predictions and accordingly designs a QS-robust objective function on these predictions to preserve the well-established common space in an online manner. As for tackling the more challenging diverse shift, REST employs a gradient decoupling module to dexterously manipulate the gradients during the adaptation process, thus preventing the CMR model from forgetting the general knowledge. Extensive experiments on 20 benchmarks across three CMR tasks verify the effectiveness of our method against QS.",

Recently, we introduced ComplexEye, a multi-lens array microscope comprising 16 independent aberration-corrected glass lenses arranged at the pitch of a 96-well plate, capable of capturing high-resolution movies of migrating cells. This architecture enables high-throughput live-cell video microscopy for migration analysis, supporting routine quantification of autonomous motility with strong potential for clinical translation. However, ComplexEye and similar high-throughput imaging platforms generate data at an exponential rate, imposing substantial burdens on storage and transmission. To address this challenge, we present FlowRoI, a fast optical-flow-based region of interest (RoI) extraction framework designed for high-throughput image compression in immune cell migration studies. FlowRoI estimates optical flow between consecutive frames and derives RoI masks that reliably cover nearly all migrating cells. The raw image and its corresponding RoI mask are then jointly encoded using JPEG2000 to enable RoI-aware compression. FlowRoI operates with high computational efficiency, achieving runtimes comparable to standard JPEG2000 and reaching an average throughput of about 30 frames per second on a modern laptop equipped with an Intel i7-1255U CPU. In terms of image quality, FlowRoI yields higher peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) in cellular regions and achieves 2.0-2.2x higher compression rates at matched PSNR compared to standard JPEG2000.",

As a non-invasive alternative, photoplethysmography (PPG) measurements are routinely collected in hospital settings. Unfortunately, the prediction of key cardiac biomarkers from PPG instead of APW remains an open challenge, further complicated by the scarcity of annotated PPG measurements. As a solution, we propose a hybrid approach that uses hemodynamic simulations and unlabeled clinical data to estimate cardiovascular biomarkers directly from PPG signals. Our hybrid model combines a conditional variational autoencoder trained on paired PPG-APW data with a conditional density estimator of cardiac biomarkers trained on labeled simulated APW segments. As a key result, our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach can detect fluctuations of cardiac output and stroke volume and outperform a supervised baseline in monitoring temporal changes in these biomarkers.",

Recent offloading systems migrate the KVCache to CPU memory and incorporate top-k attention to reduce the volume of data transferred from the CPU, while further applying system-level optimizations such as on-GPU caching and prefetching to lower transfer overhead. However, they overlook the CPU bottleneck in three aspects: (1) substantial overhead of fine-grained dynamic cache management performed on the CPU side, (2) significant transfer overhead from poor PCIe bandwidth utilization caused by heavy gathering operations at the CPU side, and (3) GPU runtime bubbles introduced by coarse-grained CPU-centric synchronization. To address these challenges, we propose CLO, a CPU-light KVCache offloading system via algorithm-system co-design. CLO features: (1) a coarse-grained head-wise approximate on-GPU caching strategy with negligible cache management cost, (2) seamless combination of data prefetching and on-GPU persistent caching for lower transfer overhead, (3) a zero-copy transfer engine to fully exploit PCIe bandwidth, and a GPU-centric synchronization method to eliminate GPU stalls. Evaluation on two widely-used LLMs demonstrates that CLO achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art systems, while substantially minimizing CPU overhead, fully utilizing PCIe bandwidth, thus improving decoding throughput by 9.3%-66.6%. Our results highlight that algorithm-system co-design is essential for memory-constrained LLM inference on modern GPU platforms. We open source CLO at this https URL.",

        "abstract": "Diffusion and flow matching models have recently emerged as promising approaches for peptide binder design. Despite their progress, these models still face two major challenges. First, categorical sampling of discrete residue types collapses their continuous parameters into onehot assignments, while continuous variables (e.g., atom positions) evolve smoothly throughout the generation process. This mismatch disrupts the update dynamics and results in suboptimal performance. Second, current models assume unimodal distributions for side-chain torsion angles, which conflicts with the inherently multimodal nature of side chain rotameric states and limits prediction accuracy. To address these limitations, we introduce PepBFN, the first Bayesian flow network for full atom peptide design that directly models parameter distributions in fully continuous space. Specifically, PepBFN models discrete residue types by learning their continuous parameter distributions, enabling joint and smooth Bayesian updates with other continuous structural parameters. It further employs a novel Gaussian mixture based Bayesian flow to capture the multimodal side chain rotameric states and a Matrix Fisher based Riemannian flow to directly model residue orientations on the $\\mathrm{SO}(3)$ manifold. Together, these parameter distributions are progressively refined via Bayesian updates, yielding smooth and coherent peptide generation. Experiments on side chain packing, reverse folding, and binder design tasks demonstrate the strong potential of PepBFN in computational peptide design.",

        "abstract": "Incomplete data are common in real-world tabular applications, where numerical, categorical, and discrete attributes coexist within a single dataset. This heterogeneous structure presents significant challenges for existing diffusion-based imputation models, which typically assume a homogeneous feature space and rely on stochastic denoising trajectories. Such assumptions make it difficult to maintain conditional consistency, and they often lead to information collapse for categorical variables or instability when numerical variables require deterministic updates. These limitations indicate that a single diffusion process is insufficient for mixed-type tabular imputation. We propose a hybrid deterministic diffusion framework that separates heterogeneous features into two complementary generative channels. A continuous DDIM-based channel provides efficient and stable deterministic denoising for numerical variables, while a discrete latent-path diffusion channel, inspired by loopholing-based discrete diffusion, models categorical and discrete features without leaving their valid sample manifolds. The two channels are trained under a unified conditional imputation objective, enabling coherent reconstruction of mixed-type incomplete data. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets show that the proposed framework achieves higher imputation accuracy, more stable sampling trajectories, and improved robustness across MCAR, MAR, and MNAR settings compared with existing diffusion-based and classical methods. These results demonstrate the importance of structure-aware diffusion processes for advancing deep learning approaches to incomplete tabular data.",

However, projecting datasets in lower dimensions often entails some distortion, which is not necessarily easy to recognize but can lead users to misleading conclusions. Several Projection Quality Metrics (PQMs) have been developed as tools to quantify the goodness-of-fit of a DR projection; however, they mostly focus on measuring how well the projection captures the global or local structure of the data, without taking into account the visual distortion of the resulting plots, thus often ignoring the presence of outliers or artifacts that can mislead a visual analysis of the projection. In this work, we introduce the Warping Index (WI), a new metric for measuring the quality of DR projections onto the 2D plane, based on the assumption that the correct preservation of empty regions between points is of crucial importance towards a faithful visual representation of the data.",

However, despite the abundance of \\textit{closed-vocabulary} models that are not pre-trained with language supervision, applying task arithmetic to these models remains unexplored. In this paper, we deploy and study task addition in closed-vocabulary image classification models. We consider different pre-training schemes and find that \\textit{weight disentanglement} -- the property enabling task arithmetic -- is a general consequence of pre-training, as it appears in different pre-trained closed-vocabulary models. In fact, we find that pre-trained closed-vocabulary vision transformers can also be edited with task arithmetic, achieving high task addition performance and enabling the efficient deployment of multi-task models. Finally, we demonstrate that simple linear probing is a competitive baseline to task addition. Overall, our findings expand the applicability of task arithmetic to a broader class of pre-trained models and open the way for more efficient use of pre-trained models in diverse settings.",

        "abstract": "In multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF), accurately modeling the intricate dependencies among multiple variables remains a significant challenge due to the inherent limitations of traditional approaches. Most existing models adopt either \\textbf{channel-independent} (CI) or \\textbf{channel-dependent} (CD) strategies, each presenting distinct drawbacks. CI methods fail to leverage the potential insights from inter-channel interactions, resulting in models that may not fully exploit the underlying statistical dependencies present in the data. Conversely, CD approaches often incorporate too much extraneous information, risking model overfitting and predictive inefficiency. To address these issues, we introduce the Adaptive Forecasting Transformer (\\textbf{Adapformer}), an advanced Transformer-based framework that merges the benefits of CI and CD methodologies through effective channel management. The core of Adapformer lies in its dual-stage encoder-decoder architecture, which includes the \\textbf{A}daptive \\textbf{C}hannel \\textbf{E}nhancer (\\textbf{ACE}) for enriching embedding processes and the \\textbf{A}daptive \\textbf{C}hannel \\textbf{F}orecaster (\\textbf{ACF}) for refining the predictions. ACE enhances token representations by selectively incorporating essential dependencies, while ACF streamlines the decoding process by focusing on the most relevant covariates, substantially reducing noise and redundancy. Our rigorous testing on diverse datasets shows that Adapformer achieves superior performance over existing models, enhancing both predictive accuracy and computational efficiency, thus making it state-of-the-art in MTSF.",

However, current medical screening methods often miss the early warning signs of smoking-related health problems, leading to late-stage diagnoses when treatment options become limited. This study presents a systematic comparative evaluation of machine learning approaches for smoking-related health risk assessment, emphasizing clinical interpretability and practical deployment over algorithmic innovation. We analyzed health screening data from 55,691 individuals, examining various health indicators, including body measurements, blood tests, and demographic information. We tested three advanced prediction algorithms - Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM - to determine which could most accurately identify people at high risk. This study employed a cross-sectional design to classify current smoking status based on health screening biomarkers, not to predict future disease development. Our Random Forest model performed best, achieving an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.926, meaning it could reliably distinguish between high-risk and lower-risk individuals. Using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis to understand what the model was detecting, we found that key health markers played crucial roles in prediction: blood pressure levels, triglyceride concentrations, liver enzyme readings, and kidney function indicators (serum creatinine) were the strongest signals of declining health in smokers.",

        "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training while preserving data privacy. However, it remains vulnerable to malicious clients who compromise model integrity through Byzantine attacks, data poisoning, or adaptive adversarial behaviors. Existing defense mechanisms rely on static thresholds and binary classification, failing to adapt to evolving client behaviors in real-world deployments. We propose FLARE, an adaptive reputation-based framework that transforms client reliability assessment from binary decisions to a continuous, multi-dimensional trust evaluation. FLARE integrates: (i) a multi-dimensional reputation score capturing performance consistency, statistical anomaly indicators, and temporal behavior, (ii) a self-calibrating adaptive threshold mechanism that adjusts security strictness based on model convergence and recent attack intensity, (iii) reputation-weighted aggregation with soft exclusion to proportionally limit suspicious contributions rather than eliminating clients outright, and (iv) a Local Differential Privacy (LDP) mechanism enabling reputation scoring on privatized client updates. We further introduce a highly evasive Statistical Mimicry (SM) attack, a benchmark adversary that blends honest gradients with synthetic perturbations and persistent drift to remain undetected by traditional filters. Extensive experiments with 100 clients on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and SVHN demonstrate that FLARE maintains high model accuracy and converges faster than state-of-the-art Byzantine-robust methods under diverse attack types, including label flipping, gradient scaling, adaptive attacks, ALIE, and SM. FLARE improves robustness by up to 16% and preserves model convergence within 30% of the non-attacked baseline, while achieving strong malicious-client detection performance with minimal computational overhead. this https URL",

        "abstract": "Adaptive optimizers with decoupled weight decay, such as AdamW, are the de facto standard for pre-training large transformer-based generative models. Yet the quadratic nature of the $\\ell_2$ penalty embedded in weight decay drives all parameters toward the origin at the same rate, making the update vulnerable to rare but extreme gradient directions and often over-penalizing well-conditioned coordinates. We propose AdamHuberDecay, a drop-in replacement for AdamW that substitutes the $\\ell_2$ penalty with a decoupled smooth Huber regularizer. The resulting update decays parameters quadratically while their magnitude remains below a threshold $\\delta$, and linearly ($\\ell_1$-like) once they exceed $\\delta$, yielding (i) bounded regularization gradients, (ii) invariance to per-coordinate second-moment rescaling, and (iii) stronger sparsity pressure on overgrown weights. We derive the closed-form decoupled Huber decay step and show how to integrate it with any Adam-family optimizer at $O(1)$ extra cost. Extensive experiments on GPT-2 and GPT-3 pre-training demonstrate that AdamHuberDecay (a) converges 10-15% faster in wall-clock time, (b) reduces validation perplexity by up to 4 points, (c) delivers performance improvements of 2.5-4.7% across downstream tasks, and (d) yields visibly sparser weight histograms that translate into 20-30% memory savings after magnitude pruning, without tuning the decay coefficient beyond the default grid used for AdamW. Ablations confirm robustness to outlier gradients and large-batch regimes, together with theoretical analyses that bound the expected parameter norm under noisy updates. AdamHuberDecay therefore provides a simple, principled path toward more efficient and resilient training of next-generation foundational generative transformers.",

For drug discovery specifically, a key inflection - akin to vision's \"ImageNet moment\" - arrived in 2015, when deep neural networks surpassed traditional approaches on the Tox21 Data Challenge. This milestone accelerated the adoption of deep learning across the pharmaceutical industry, and today most major companies have integrated these methods into their research pipelines. After the Tox21 Challenge concluded, its dataset was included in several established benchmarks, such as MoleculeNet and the Open Graph Benchmark. However, during these integrations, the dataset was altered and labels were imputed or manufactured, resulting in a loss of comparability across studies. Consequently, the extent to which bioactivity and toxicity prediction methods have improved over the past decade remains unclear. To this end, we introduce a reproducible leaderboard, hosted on Hugging Face with the original Tox21 Challenge dataset, together with a set of baseline and representative methods. The current version of the leaderboard indicates that the original Tox21 winner - the ensemble-based DeepTox method - and the descriptor-based self-normalizing neural networks introduced in 2017, continue to perform competitively and rank among the top methods for toxicity prediction, leaving it unclear whether substantial progress in toxicity prediction has been achieved over the past decade. As part of this work, we make all baselines and evaluated models publicly accessible for inference via standardized API calls to Hugging Face Spaces.",

        "abstract": "On many learning platforms, the optimization criteria guiding model training reflect the priorities of the designer rather than those of the individuals they affect. Consequently, users may act strategically to obtain more favorable outcomes, effectively contesting the platform's predictions. While past work has studied strategic user behavior on learning platforms, the focus has largely been on strategic responses to a deployed model, without considering the behavior of other users. In contrast, look-ahead reasoning takes into account that user actions are coupled, and -- at scale -- impact future predictions. Within this framework, we first formalize level-$k$ thinking, a concept from behavioral economics, where users aim to outsmart their peers by looking one step ahead. We show that, while convergence to an equilibrium is accelerated, the equilibrium remains the same, providing no benefit of higher-level reasoning for individuals in the long run. Then, we focus on collective reasoning, where users take coordinated actions by optimizing through their joint impact on the model. By contrasting collective with selfish behavior, we characterize the benefits and limits of coordination; a new notion of alignment between the learner's and the users' utilities emerges as a key concept. We discuss connections to several related mathematical frameworks, including strategic classification, performative prediction, and algorithmic collective action.",

        "abstract": "Spatiotemporal data mining (STDM) has a wide range of applications in various complex physical systems (CPS), i.e., transportation, manufacturing, healthcare, etc. Among all the proposed methods, the Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) has proved to be generalizable and extendable in different applications and has multiple variants achieving state-of-the-art performance in various STDM applications. However, ConvLSTM and its variants are computationally expensive, which makes them inapplicable in edge devices with limited computational resources. With the emerging need for edge computing in CPS, efficient AI is essential to reduce the computational cost while preserving the model performance. Common methods of efficient AI are developed to reduce redundancy in model capacity (i.e., model pruning, compression, etc.). However, spatiotemporal data mining naturally requires extensive model capacity, as the embedded dependencies in spatiotemporal data are complex and hard to capture, which limits the model redundancy. Instead, there is a fairly high level of data and feature redundancy that introduces an unnecessary computational burden, which has been largely overlooked in existing research. Therefore, we developed a novel framework SparseST, that pioneered in exploiting data sparsity to develop an efficient spatiotemporal model. In addition, we explore and approximate the Pareto front between model performance and computational efficiency by designing a multi-objective composite loss function, which provides a practical guide for practitioners to adjust the model according to computational resource constraints and the performance requirements of downstream tasks.",

However, these single-filter models suffer from a \"compromise\" problem, as their single adaptive parameter (e.g., alpha) must learn a suboptimal, averaged response across the entire graph spectrum. In this paper, we propose DualLaguerreNet, a novel GNN architecture that solves this by introducing \"Decoupled Spectral Flexibility.\" DualLaguerreNet splits the graph Laplacian into two operators, L_low (low-frequency) and L_high (high-frequency), and learns two independent, adaptive Laguerre polynomial filters, parameterized by alpha_1 and alpha_2, respectively. This work, however, uncovers a deeper finding. While our experiments show DualLaguerreNet's flexibility allows it to achieve state-of-the-art results on complex heterophilic tasks (outperforming LaguerreNet), it simultaneously underperforms on simpler, homophilic tasks. We identify this as a fundamental \"Flexibility-Stability Trade-off\". The increased parameterization (2x filter parameters and 2x model parameters) leads to overfitting on simple tasks, demonstrating that the \"compromise\" of simpler models acts as a crucial regularizer. This paper presents a new SOTA architecture for heterophily while providing a critical analysis of the bias-variance trade-off inherent in adaptive GNN filter design.",

        "abstract": "Spectral Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) operating in the canonical [-1, 1] domain (like ChebyNet and its adaptive generalization, L-JacobiNet) face a fundamental Flexibility-Stability Trade-off. Our previous work revealed a critical puzzle: the 2-parameter adaptive L-JacobiNet often suffered from high variance and was surprisingly outperformed by the 0-parameter, stabilized-static S-JacobiNet. This suggested that stabilization was more critical than adaptation in this domain. In this paper, we propose \\textbf{GegenbauerNet}, a novel GNN filter based on the Gegenbauer polynomials, to find the Optimal Compromise in this trade-off. By enforcing symmetry (alpha=beta) but allowing a single shape parameter (lambda) to be learned, GegenbauerNet limits flexibility (variance) while escaping the fixed bias of S-JacobiNet. We demonstrate that GegenbauerNet (1-parameter) achieves superior performance in the key local filtering regime (K=2 on heterophilic graphs) where overfitting is minimal, validating the hypothesis that a controlled, symmetric degree of freedom is optimal. Furthermore, our comprehensive K-ablation study across homophilic and heterophilic graphs, using 7 diverse datasets, clarifies the domain's behavior: the fully adaptive L-JacobiNet maintains the highest performance on high-K filtering tasks, showing the value of maximum flexibility when regularization is managed. This study provides crucial design principles for GNN developers, showing that in the [-1, 1] spectral domain, the optimal filter depends critically on the target locality (K) and the acceptable level of design bias.",

However, for speech LLMs that generate acoustic tokens, exact token matching is overly restrictive: many discrete tokens are acoustically or semantically interchangeable, reducing acceptance rates and limiting speedups. We introduce Principled Coarse-Graining (PCG), which verifies proposals at the level of Acoustic Similarity Groups (ASGs) derived from the target model's embedding space. By splitting each token's probability mass across the overlapping groups that contain it, we define an overlap-aware coarse-grained distribution and perform rejection sampling on the resulting group variable. This yields an exactness guarantee at the group level while allowing the accepted draft token to stand in for any member of the group in practice. On LibriTTS, PCG increases acceptance and throughput relative to standard speculative decoding and prior speech-specific relaxations while maintaining intelligibility and speaker similarity. These results suggest acoustically aware, group-level acceptance as a simple and general way to accelerate speech token generation while maintaining speech quality.",

However, most existing methods, particularly autoregressive (AR) frameworks, primarily rely on straightforward temporal sequencing of multi-channel EEG data, which fails to capture the rich physiological characteristics inherent to EEG signals. Moreover, their time-centered modeling approach also limits the effective representation of the dynamic spatial topology of brain activity. To address these challenges and fully exploit the potential of large-scale EEG models, we propose a novel Topology Hierarchical Derived Brain Autoregressive Modeling (THD-BAR) for EEG generic representations. The core innovation of THD-BAR lies in the introduction of the Brain Topology Hierarchy (BTH), which establishes a multi-scale spatial order for EEG channels. This hierarchical structure enables a redefinition of autoregressive learning as a \"next-scale-time prediction\" problem, effectively capturing both spatial and temporal dynamics. Based on BTH, we design a Topology-Hierarchical Vector Quantized-Variational Autoencoder (THVQ-VAE) for multi-scale tokenization and develop an enhanced Brain Autoregressive (BAR) module with specialized masking strategies for prediction. Through extensive large-scale pre-training on 17 datasets, followed by rigorous validation on 10 downstream datasets spanning 5 distinct tasks, THD-BAR consistently outperforms existing methods.

We use the open-source nanochat project, a compact 8K-line full-stack ChatGPT-like implementation containing tokenization, pretraining, fine-tuning, and serving, as a controlled baseline. We implement the DiLoCo algorithm as a lightweight wrapper over nanochat's training loop, performing multiple local steps per worker before synchronization with an outer optimizer, effectively reducing communication by orders of magnitude. This inner-outer training is compared against a standard data-parallel (DDP) setup. Because nanochat is small and inspectable, it enables controlled pipeline adaptations and allows direct comparison with the conventional centralized baseline. DiLoCo achieves stable convergence and competitive loss in pretraining but yields worse MMLU, GSM8K, and HumanEval scores after mid-training and SFT. We discover that using DiLoCo-pretrained weights and running mid- and post-training with DDP fails to recover performance, revealing irreversible representation drift from asynchronous updates that impairs downstream alignment. We provide this implementation as an official fork of nanochat on GitHub.",

Analytically, for unequal service rates and total-time patience, we show that total wait grows linearly so abandonment is inevitable and the probability of a successful jockey vanishes as the backlog approaches towards infinity. Furthermore, under a mild sub-linear error condition both information models yield the same asymptotic limits (robustness). We empirically validate these limits and quantify finite backlog differences. Our findings show that learned and analytic feeds produce different delays, reneging rates and transient jockeying behavior at practical sizes, but converge to the same asymptotic outcome implied by our theory. The results characterize when value-of-information matters (finite regimes) and when it does not (asymptotics), informing lightweight telemetry and decision-logic design for low-cost, jockeying-aware systems.",

        "abstract": "Mobile devices increasingly require the parallel execution of several computing tasks offloaded at the wireless edge. Existing communication systems only support parallel transmissions at the bit level, which fundamentally limits the number of tasks that can be concurrently processed. To address this bottleneck, this paper introduces the new concept of Semantic Multiplexing. Our approach shifts stream multiplexing from bits to tasks by merging multiple task-related compressed representations into a single semantic representation. As such, Semantic Multiplexing can multiplex more tasks than the number of physical channels without adding antennas or widening bandwidth by extending the effective degrees of freedom at the semantic layer, without contradicting Shannon capacity rules. We have prototyped Semantic Multiplexing on an experimental testbed with Jetson Orin Nano and millimeter-wave software-defined radios and tested its performance on image classification and sentiment analysis while comparing to several existing baselines in semantic communications. Our experiments demonstrate that Semantic Multiplexing allows jointly processing multiple tasks at the semantic level while maintaining sufficient task accuracy. For example, image classification accuracy drops by less than 4% when increasing from 2 to 8 the number of tasks multiplexed over a 4$\\times$4 channel. Semantic Multiplexing reduces latency, energy consumption, and communication load respectively by up to 8$\\times$, 25$\\times$, and 54$\\times$ compared to the baselines while keeping comparable performance. We pledge to publicly share the complete software codebase and the collected datasets for reproducibility.",

However, current technologies provide only sparse, static snapshots of cell states and are inherently influenced by technical noise, complicating the inference and representation of continuous transcriptional dynamics. Although embedding methods can reduce dimensionality and mitigate technical noise, the majority of existing approaches typically treat trajectory inference separately from embedding construction, often neglecting temporal structure. To address this challenge, here we introduce CellStream, a novel deep learning framework that jointly learns embedding and cellular dynamics from single-cell snapshot data by integrating an autoencoder with unbalanced dynamical optimal transport. Compared to existing methods, CellStream generates dynamics-informed embeddings that robustly capture temporal developmental processes while maintaining high consistency with the underlying data manifold. We demonstrate CellStream's effectiveness on both simulated datasets and real scRNA-seq data, including spatial transcriptomics. Our experiments indicate significant quantitative improvements over state-of-the-art methods in representing cellular trajectories with enhanced temporal coherence and reduced noise sensitivity. Overall, CellStream provides a new tool for learning and representing continuous streams from the noisy, static snapshots of single-cell gene expression.",

However, capturing the complex spatial and temporal dependencies of HIV transmission remains challenging. Conventional Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) models rely on a fixed binary adjacency matrix that only encodes geographic adjacency, which is unable to represent interactions between non-contiguous counties. Our study proposes a deep learning architecture Mobility-Aware Transformer-Message Passing Neural Network (MAT-MPNN) framework to predict county-level HIV diagnosis rates across California, Florida, and the New England region. The model combines temporal features extracted by a Transformer encoder with spatial relationships captured through a Mobility Graph Generator (MGG). The MGG improves conventional adjacency matrices by combining geographic and demographic information. Compared with the best-performing hybrid baseline, the Transformer MPNN model, MAT-MPNN reduced the Mean Squared Prediction Error (MSPE) by 27.9% in Florida, 39.1% in California, and 12.5% in New England, and improved the Predictive Model Choice Criterion (PMCC) by 7.7%, 3.5%, and 3.9%, respectively. MAT-MPNN also achieved better results than the Spatially Varying Auto-Regressive (SVAR) model in Florida and New England, with comparable performance in California. These results demonstrate that applying mobility-aware dynamic spatial structures substantially enhances predictive accuracy and calibration in spatiotemporal epidemiological prediction.",

Because the Zipfian distribution well models the distribution of n-grams, we exploit its properties to develop a new top-k n-gram extractor that is up to $35\\times$ faster than the previous best alternative.

This paper introduces Quasi-Adaptive Search with Asymptotic Reinitialization (QUASAR), an evolutionary algorithm to accelerate convergence in complex, non-differentiable problems afflicted by the curse of dimensionality. Evaluated on the notoriously difficult CEC2017 benchmark suite of 29 functions, QUASAR achieved the lowest overall rank sum (150) using the Friedman test, significantly outperforming L-SHADE (229) and standard DE (305) in the dimension-variant trials. QUASAR also proves computationally efficient, with run times averaging $1.4 \\text{x}$ faster than DE and $7.8 \\text{x}$ faster than L-SHADE ($p \\ll 0.001$) in the population-variant trials. Building upon Differential Evolution (DE), QUASAR introduces a highly stochastic architecture to dynamically balance exploration and exploitation. Inspired by the probabilistic behavior of quantum particles in a stellar core, the algorithm implements three primary components that augment standard DE mechanisms: 1) probabilistically selected mutation strategies and scaling factors; 2) rank-based crossover rates; 3) asymptotically decaying reinitialization that leverages a covariance matrix of the best solutions to introduce high-quality genetic diversity. QUASAR's performance establishes it as an effective, user-friendly optimizer for complex high-dimensional problems.",

To address this, we propose the Disentangled Recurrent Neural Network (DisRNN), a generative lrRNN framework that assumes group-wise independence among latent dynamics while allowing flexible within-group entanglement. These independent latent groups allow latent dynamics to evolve separately, but are internally rich for complex computation. We reformulate the lrRNN under a variational autoencoder (VAE) framework, enabling us to introduce a partial correlation penalty that encourages disentanglement between groups of latent dimensions. Experiments on synthetic, monkey M1, and mouse voltage imaging data show that DisRNN consistently improves the disentanglement and interpretability of learned neural latent trajectories in low-dimensional space and low-rank connectivity over baseline lrRNNs that do not encourage partial disentanglement.",

To enable safe and reliable use of such predictions in healthcare, we introduce a conformal method for uncertainty-calibrated prediction of biomarker trajectories resulting from randomly-timed clinical visits of patients. Our approach extends conformal prediction to the setting of randomly-timed trajectories via a novel nonconformity score that produces prediction bands guaranteed to cover the unknown biomarker trajectories with a user-prescribed probability. We apply our method across a wide range of standard and state-of-the-art predictors for two well-established brain biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease, using neuroimaging data from real clinical studies. We observe that our conformal prediction bands consistently achieve the desired coverage, while also being tighter than baseline prediction bands. To further account for population heterogeneity, we develop group-conditional conformal bands and test their coverage guarantees across various demographic and clinically relevant subpopulations. Moreover, we demonstrate the clinical utility of our conformal bands in identifying subjects at high risk of progression to Alzheimer's disease. Specifically, we introduce an uncertainty-calibrated risk score that enables the identification of 17.5% more high-risk subjects compared to standard risk scores, highlighting the value of uncertainty calibration in real-world clinical decision making.

        "abstract": "Real-time imaging sonar has become an important tool for underwater monitoring in environments where optical sensing is unreliable. Its broader use is constrained by two coupled challenges: highly limited uplink bandwidth and severe sonar-specific artifacts (speckle, motion blur, reverberation, acoustic shadows) that affect up to 98% of frames. We present SCOPE, a self-supervised framework that jointly performs compression and artifact correction without clean-noise pairs or synthetic assumptions. SCOPE combines (i) Adaptive Codebook Compression (ACC), which learns frequency-encoded latent representations tailored to sonar, with (ii) Frequency-Aware Multiscale Segmentation (FAMS), which decomposes frames into low-frequency structure and sparse high-frequency dynamics while suppressing rapidly fluctuating artifacts. A hedging training strategy further guides frequency-aware learning using low-pass proxy pairs generated without labels. Evaluated on months of in-situ ARIS sonar data, SCOPE achieves a structural similarity index (SSIM) of 0.77, representing a 40% improvement over prior self-supervised denoising baselines, at bitrates down to <= 0.0118 bpp. It reduces uplink bandwidth by more than 80% while improving downstream detection. The system runs in real time, with 3.1 ms encoding on an embedded GPU and 97 ms full multi-layer decoding on the server end. SCOPE has been deployed for months in three Pacific Northwest rivers to support real-time salmon enumeration and environmental monitoring in the wild. Results demonstrate that learning frequency-structured latents enables practical, low-bitrate sonar streaming with preserved signal details under real-world deployment conditions.",

        "abstract": "Human emotions are difficult to convey through words and are often abstracted in the process; however, electroencephalogram (EEG) signals can offer a more direct lens into emotional brain activity. Recent studies show that deep learning models can process these signals to perform emotion recognition with high accuracy. However, many existing approaches overlook the dynamic interplay between distinct brain regions, which can be crucial to understanding how emotions unfold and evolve over time, potentially aiding in more accurate emotion recognition. To address this, we propose RBTransformer, a Transformer-based neural network architecture that models inter-cortical neural dynamics of the brain in latent space to better capture structured neural interactions for effective EEG-based emotion recognition. First, the EEG signals are converted into Band Differential Entropy (BDE) tokens, which are then passed through Electrode Identity embeddings to retain spatial provenance. These tokens are processed through successive inter-cortical multi-head attention blocks that construct an electrode x electrode attention matrix, allowing the model to learn the inter-cortical neural dependencies. The resulting features are then passed through a classification head to obtain the final prediction. We conducted extensive experiments, specifically under subject-dependent settings, on the SEED, DEAP, and DREAMER datasets, over all three dimensions, Valence, Arousal, and Dominance (for DEAP and DREAMER), under both binary and multi-class classification settings. The results demonstrate that the proposed RBTransformer outperforms all previous state-of-the-art methods across all three datasets, over all three dimensions under both classification settings.

A model trained yesterday to map a developer's natural-language question to the exact set of repository file paths that matter will degrade tomorrow, even if the questions themselves look unchanged. In this paper we study, at system scale and across several widely used repositories, how to keep such a model fresh without surrendering retention on earlier code. We frame freshness as a form of domain drift between a base snapshot and the current HEAD, and we compare three families of update strategies: (A) Full Refresh, retraining the entire model at the new snapshot; (B) In-Context Learning (ICL) that injects recent deltas (raw git diffs or concise English summaries) at inference; and (C) Incremental Fine-Tuning (Inc-FT) on delta-derived training sets, with carefully controlled NEW:OLD mixing to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. We contribute an alias-aware evaluation protocol that credits rename while never rewarding deleted paths, and a practical Forgetting Probe that quantifies residual emissions of obsolete paths. Across Flask, SQLAlchemy, Pandas, and Poetry, Inc-FT with old-aware mixes delivers the best overall balance on mixed sets, ICL with English delta summaries delivers the fastest new-code lift when training is not feasible, and Full Refresh remains the ceiling when maximum NEW accuracy matters. We also compare Git-diff Inc-FT to full-file Inc-FT, showing that diffs excel in rename/delete-heavy windows while full-file context wins in behavior-change-heavy windows.",

The power of splat modeling lies in its ability to locally adjust the scale and direction of each splat, achieving both high interpretability and accuracy. Fitting splat models reduces to optimization over the space of mixing measures, which can be implemented using Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao gradient flows. As a byproduct, we recover the popular Gaussian Splatting methodology as a special case, providing a unified theoretical framework for this state-of-the-art technique that clearly disambiguates the inverse problem, the model, and the optimization algorithm.

        "abstract": "Log anomaly detection, which is critical for identifying system failures and preempting security breaches, detects irregular patterns within large volumes of log data, and impacts domains such as service reliability, performance optimization, and database log analysis. Modern log anomaly detection methods rely on training deep learning models on clean, anomaly-free log sequences. However, obtaining such clean log data requires costly and tedious human labeling, and existing automatic cleaning methods fail to fully integrate the specific characteristics and actual semantics of logs in their purification process. In this paper, we propose a cost-aware, rule-enhanced purification framework, LogPurge, that automatically selects a sufficient subset of normal log sequences from contamination log sequences to train a anomaly detection model. Our approach involves a two-stage filtering algorithm: In the first stage, we use a large language model (LLM) to remove clustered anomalous patterns and enhance system rules to improve LLM's understanding of system logs; in the second stage, we utilize a divide-and-conquer strategy that decomposes the remaining contaminated regions into smaller subproblems, allowing each to be effectively purified through the first stage procedure. Our experiments, conducted on two public datasets and one industrial dataset, show that our method significantly removes an average of 98.74% of anomalies while retaining 82.39% of normal samples. Compared to the latest unsupervised log sample selection algorithms, our method achieves F-1 score improvements of 35.7% and 84.11% on the public datasets, and an impressive 149.72% F-1 improvement on the private dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.",

        "abstract": "Neonates are highly susceptible to seizures, often leading to short or long-term neurological impairments. However, clinical manifestations of neonatal seizures are subtle and often lead to misdiagnoses. This increases the risk of prolonged, untreated seizure activity and subsequent brain injury. Continuous video electroencephalogram (cEEG) monitoring is the gold standard for seizure detection. However, this is an expensive evaluation that requires expertise and time. In this study, we propose a convolutional neural network-based model for early prediction of neonatal seizures by distinguishing between interictal and preictal states of the EEG. Our model is patient-independent, enabling generalization across multiple subjects, and utilizes mel-frequency cepstral coefficient matrices extracted from multichannel EEG and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals as input features. Trained and validated on the Helsinki neonatal EEG dataset with 10-fold cross-validation, the proposed model achieved an average accuracy of 97.52%, sensitivity of 98.31%, specificity of 96.39%, and F1-score of 97.95%, enabling accurate seizure prediction up to 30 minutes before onset. The inclusion of ECG alongside EEG improved the F1-score by 1.42%, while the incorporation of an attention mechanism yielded an additional 0.5% improvement. To enhance transparency, we incorporated SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) as an explainable artificial intelligence method to interpret the model and provided localization of seizure focus using scalp plots. The overall results demonstrate the model's potential for minimally supervised deployment in neonatal intensive care units, enabling timely and reliable prediction of neonatal seizures, while demonstrating strong generalization capability across unseen subjects through transfer learning.",

While GPU memory offloading to CPU and NVMe has made large-scale training more feasible, existing approaches suffer from high tensor migration latency and suboptimal device memory utilization, ultimately increasing training time and cloud costs. To address these challenges, we present 10Cache, a resource-aware tensor caching and migration system that accelerates LLM training by intelligently coordinating memory usage across GPU, CPU, and NVMe tiers. 10Cache profiles tensor execution order to construct prefetch policies, allocates memory buffers in pinned memory based on tensor size distributions, and reuses memory buffers to minimize allocation overhead. Designed for cloud-scale deployments, 10Cache improves memory efficiency and reduces reliance on high-end GPUs. Across diverse LLM workloads, it achieves up to 2x speedup in training time, improves GPU cache hit rate by up to 86.6x, and increases CPU/GPU memory utilization by up to 2.15x and 1.33x, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art offloading methods. These results demonstrate that 10Cache is a practical and scalable solution for optimizing LLM training throughput and resource efficiency in cloud environments.",

        "abstract": "Fine-grained identification of IDS-flagged suspicious traffic is crucial in cybersecurity. In practice, cyber threats evolve continuously, making the discovery of novel malicious traffic a critical necessity as well as the identification of known classes. Recent studies have advanced this goal with deep models, but they often rely on task-specific architectures that limit transferability and require per-dataset tuning. In this paper we introduce MalRAG, the first LLM driven retrieval-augmented framework for open-set malicious traffic identification. MalRAG freezes the LLM and operates via comprehensive traffic knowledge construction, adaptive retrieval, and prompt engineering. Concretely, we construct a multi-view traffic database by mining prior malicious traffic from content, structural, and temporal perspectives. Furthermore, we introduce a Coverage-Enhanced Retrieval Algorithm that queries across these views to assemble the most probable candidates, thereby improving the inclusion of correct evidence. We then employ Traffic-Aware Adaptive Pruning to select a variable subset of these candidates based on traffic-aware similarity scores, suppressing incorrect matches and yielding reliable retrieved evidence. Moreover, we develop a suite of guidance prompts where task instruction, evidence referencing, and decision guidance are integrated with the retrieved evidence to improve LLM performance. Across diverse real-world datasets and settings, MalRAG delivers state-of-the-art results in both fine-grained identification of known classes and novel malicious traffic discovery. Ablation and deep-dive analyses further show that MalRAG effective leverages LLM capabilities yet achieves open-set malicious traffic identification without relying on a specific LLM.",

We present HyperABSA, a dynamic hypergraph framework that induces aspect-opinion structures through sample-specific hierarchical clustering. To construct these hyperedges, we introduce a novel acceleration-fallback cutoff for hierarchical clustering, which adaptively determines the level of granularity. Experiments on three benchmarks (Lap14, Rest14, MAMS) show consistent improvements over strong graph baselines, with substantial gains when paired with RoBERTa backbones.

The radius of the ambiguity set is measured via convex spectral divergence. We demonstrate that the proposed distributionally robust estimation model can be reduced to a convex optimization problem, thereby yielding quasi-analytical estimators. The joint estimators are shown to be nonlinear shrinkage estimators. The eigenvalues of the estimators are shrunk nonlinearly towards a positive scalar, where the scalar is determined by the weight coefficient of the loss terms. By tuning the coefficient carefully, the shrinkage corrects the spectral bias of the empirical covariance/precision matrix estimator. By this property, we call the proposed joint estimator the Spectral concentrated COvariance and Precision matrix Estimator (SCOPE). We demonstrate that the shrinkage effect improves the condition number of the estimator. We provide a parameter-tuning scheme that adjusts the shrinkage target and intensity that is asymptotically optimal. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real data show that our shrinkage estimators perform competitively against state-of-the-art estimators in practical applications.",

However, traditional VLA models that generate actions through flow matching (FM) typically rely on rigid and uniform time schedules, i.e., synchronous FM (SFM). Without action context awareness and asynchronous self-correction, SFM becomes unstable in long-horizon tasks, where a single action error can cascade into failure. In this work, we propose asynchronous flow matching VLA (AsyncVLA), a novel framework that introduces temporal flexibility in asynchronous FM (AFM) and enables self-correction in action generation. AsyncVLA breaks from the vanilla SFM in VLA models by generating the action tokens in a non-uniform time schedule with action context awareness. Besides, our method introduces the confidence rater to extract confidence of the initially generated actions, enabling the model to selectively refine inaccurate action tokens before execution. Moreover, we propose a unified training procedure for SFM and AFM that endows a single model with both modes, improving KV-cache utilization. Extensive experiments on robotic manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that AsyncVLA is data-efficient and exhibits self-correction ability. AsyncVLA achieves state-of-the-art results across general embodied evaluations due to its asynchronous generation in AFM. Our code is available at this https URL.",

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in finance and economics, where prompt-based attempts against look-ahead bias implicitly assume that models understand chronology. We test this fundamental question with a series of chronological ordering tasks with increasing complexities over facts the model already knows from pre-training. Our tasks cover (1) chronological ordering, (2) conditional sorting (filter, then order), and (3) anachronism detection. We evaluate GPT-4.1, Claude-3.7 Sonnet, with and without Extended Thinking (ET), and GPT-5 across multiple reasoning-effort settings. Across models, Exact match rate drops sharply as sequences lengthen even while rank correlations stay high as LLMs largely preserve local order but struggle to maintain a single globally consistent timeline. In conditional sorting, most failures stem from the filtering step rather than the ordering step, but GPT-5 and Claude-3.7 Sonnet with Extended Thinking outshine normal models significantly. Lastly, anachronism detection is found to be the easiest task for the LLMs but performance still declines with increasingly overlapping timelines or entities. Overall, our main contribution is showing that allocating explicit reasoning budget helps with chronological ordering with GPT-5 at medium/high reasoning effort achieving flawless ordering at all lengths and perfect conditional sorting (both self-filtered and given-subset), whereas low/minimal effort degrades with longer lists, mirroring earlier models. Our findings delineate limits of current LLMs on chronological tasks, providing insights into task complexity, and demonstrate scenarios in which reasoning helps. These patterns are important for the real-time application of LLMs in finance. We release all code and evaluation templates to support full reproducibility.",

However, given access to some data from downstream tasks, a natural question arises: can the performance of these models be further improved? To this end, we propose WeSTAR, a parameter-efficient framework that performs Weakly supervised Self-Training Adaptation with Regularization, designed to enhance the robustness of MDE foundation models in unseen and diverse domains. We first adopt a dense self-training objective as the primary source of structural self-supervision. To further improve robustness, we introduce semantically-aware hierarchical normalization, which exploits instance-level segmentation maps to perform more stable and multi-scale structural normalization. Beyond dense supervision, we introduce a cost-efficient weak supervision in the form of pairwise ordinal depth annotations to further guide the adaptation process, which enforces informative ordinal constraints to mitigate local topological errors. Finally, a weight regularization loss is employed to anchor the LoRA updates, ensuring training stability and preserving the model's generalizable knowledge. Extensive experiments on both realistic and corrupted out-of-distribution datasets under diverse and challenging scenarios demonstrate that WeSTAR consistently improves generalization and achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of benchmarks.",

Training deep neural networks (DNNs) for AMT typically requires strongly aligned training pairs with precise frame-level annotations. Since creating such datasets is costly and impractical for many musical contexts, weakly aligned approaches using segment-level annotations have gained traction. However, existing methods often rely on Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) or soft alignment loss functions, both of which still require local semantic correspondences, making them error-prone and computationally expensive. In this article, we introduce CountEM, a novel AMT framework that eliminates the need for explicit local alignment by leveraging note event histograms as supervision, enabling lighter computations and greater flexibility. Using an Expectation-Maximization (EM) approach, CountEM iteratively refines predictions based solely on note occurrence counts, significantly reducing annotation efforts while maintaining high transcription accuracy. Experiments on piano, guitar, and multi-instrument datasets demonstrate that CountEM matches or surpasses existing weakly supervised methods, improving AMT's robustness, scalability, and efficiency.

Microstructure characterization and reconstruction provide effective means for modeling these materials, which are critical for conducting physical property simulations, structure-property linkage studies, and enhancing their performance across different applications. To achieve superior controllability and applicability with small sample sizes, we propose a statistically controllable microstructure reconstruction framework that integrates neural networks with sliced-Wasserstein metric. Specifically, our approach leverages local pattern distribution for microstructure characterization and employs a controlled sampling strategy to generate target distributions that satisfy given conditional parameters. A neural network-based model establishes the mapping from the input distribution to the target local pattern distribution, enabling microstructure reconstruction. Combinations of sliced-Wasserstein metric and gradient optimization techniques minimize the distance between these distributions, leading to a stable and reliable model. Our method can perform stochastic and controllable reconstruction tasks even with small sample sizes. Additionally, it can generate large-size (e.g. 512 and 1024) 3D microstructures using a chunking strategy. By introducing spatial location masks, our method excels at generating spatially heterogeneous and complex microstructures. We conducted experiments on stochastic reconstruction, controllable reconstruction, heterogeneous reconstruction, and large-size microstructure reconstruction across various materials. Comparative analysis through visualization, statistical measures, and physical property simulations demonstrates the effectiveness, providing new insights and possibilities for research on structure-property linkage and material inverse design.",

To strengthen the ability to prevent such compromises, recent research has focused on designing increasingly stealthy attacks to stress-test existing defenses, pairing backdoor behaviors with stylized artifact or token-level perturbation triggers. However, this trend diverts attention from the harder and more realistic case: making the model respond to semantic triggers such as specific names or entities, where a successful backdoor could manipulate outputs tied to real people or events in deployed systems. Motivated by this growing disconnect, we introduce SteganoBackdoor, bringing stealth techniques back into line with practical threat models. Leveraging innocuous properties from natural-language steganography, SteganoBackdoor applies a gradient-guided data optimization process to transform semantic trigger seeds into steganographic carriers that embed a high backdoor payload, remain fluent, and exhibit no representational resemblance to the trigger. Across diverse experimental settings, SteganoBackdoor achieves over 99% attack success at an order-of-magnitude lower data-poisoning rate than prior approaches while maintaining unparalleled evasion against a comprehensive suite of data-level defenses. By revealing this practical and covert attack, SteganoBackdoor highlights an urgent blind spot in current defenses and demands immediate attention to adversarial data defenses and real-world threat modeling.",

        "abstract": "Effective contact-rich manipulation requires robots to synergistically leverage vision, force, and proprioception. However, Reinforcement Learning agents struggle to learn in such multisensory settings, especially amidst sensory noise and dynamic changes. We propose MultiSensory Dynamic Pretraining (MSDP), a novel framework for learning expressive multisensory representations tailored for task-oriented policy learning. MSDP is based on masked autoencoding and trains a transformer-based encoder by reconstructing multisensory observations from only a subset of sensor embeddings, leading to cross-modal prediction and sensor fusion. For downstream policy learning, we introduce a novel asymmetric architecture, where a cross-attention mechanism allows the critic to extract dynamic, task-specific features from the frozen embeddings, while the actor receives a stable pooled representation to guide its actions. Our method demonstrates accelerated learning and robust performance under diverse perturbations, including sensor noise, and changes in object dynamics. Evaluations in multiple challenging, contact-rich robot manipulation tasks in simulation and the real world showcase the effectiveness of MSDP. Our approach exhibits strong robustness to perturbations and achieves high success rates on the real robot with as few as 6,000 online interactions, offering a simple yet powerful solution for complex multisensory robotic control.",

        "abstract": "To distinguish Markov equivalent graphs in causal discovery, it is necessary to restrict the structural causal model. Crucially, we need to be able to distinguish cause $X$ from effect $Y$ in bivariate models, that is, distinguish the two graphs $X \\to Y$ and $Y \\to X$. Location-scale noise models (LSNMs), in which the effect $Y$ is modeled based on the cause $X$ as $Y = f(X) + g(X)N$, form a flexible class of models that is general and identifiable in most cases. Estimating these models for arbitrary noise terms $N$, however, is challenging. Therefore, practical estimators are typically restricted to symmetric distributions, such as the normal distribution. As we showcase in this paper, when $N$ is a skewed random variable, which is likely in real-world domains, the reliability of these approaches decreases. To approach this limitation, we propose SkewD, a likelihood-based algorithm for bivariate causal discovery under LSNMs with skewed noise distributions. SkewD extends the usual normal-distribution framework to the skew-normal setting, enabling reliable inference under symmetric and skewed noise. For parameter estimation, we employ a combination of a heuristic search and an expectation conditional maximization algorithm. We evaluate SkewD on novel synthetically generated datasets with skewed noise as well as established benchmark datasets. Throughout our experiments, SkewD exhibits a strong performance and, in comparison to prior work, remains robust under high skewness.",

As the performance of query execution critically depends on this choice, join ordering lies at the core of query optimization. Traditional approaches cast this problem as a discrete combinatorial search over binary trees guided by a cost model, but they often suffer from high computational complexity and limited scalability. We show that, when the cost model is differentiable, the query plans can be continuously relaxed into a soft adjacency matrix representing a superposition of plans. This continuous relaxation, together with a Gumbel-Softmax parameterization of the adjacency matrix and differentiable constraints enforcing plan validity, enables gradient-based search for plans within this relaxed space. Using a learned Graph Neural Network as the cost model, we demonstrate that this gradient-based approach can find comparable and even lower-cost plans compared to traditional discrete local search methods on two different graph datasets. Furthermore, we empirically show that the runtime of this approach scales linearly with query size, in contrast to quadratic or exponential runtimes of classical approaches. We believe this first step towards gradient-based join ordering can lead to more effective and efficient query optimizers in the future.",

        "abstract": "Communication compression is essential for scalable distributed training of modern machine learning models, but it often degrades convergence due to the noise it introduces. Error Feedback (EF) mechanisms are widely adopted to mitigate this issue of distributed compression algorithms. Despite their popularity and training efficiency, existing distributed EF algorithms often require prior knowledge of problem parameters (e.g., smoothness constants) to fine-tune stepsizes. This limits their practical applicability especially in large-scale neural network training. In this paper, we study normalized error feedback algorithms that combine EF with normalized updates, various momentum variants, and parameter-agnostic, time-varying stepsizes, thus eliminating the need for problem-dependent tuning. We analyze the convergence of these algorithms for minimizing smooth functions, and establish parameter-agnostic complexity bounds that are close to the best-known bounds with carefully-tuned problem-dependent stepsizes. Specifically, we show that normalized EF21 achieve the convergence rate of near ${O}(1/T^{1/4})$ for Polyak's heavy-ball momentum, ${O}(1/T^{2/7})$ for Iterative Gradient Transport (IGT), and ${O}(1/T^{1/3})$ for STORM and Hessian-corrected momentum.

A particular strength of SNMMs is to break the joint effect of treatment sequences over time into localized, time-specific ``blip effects''. This decomposition promotes interpretability through the incremental effects and enables the efficient offline evaluation of optimal treatment policies without re-computation. However, neural frameworks for SNMMs are lacking, as their inherently sequential g-estimation scheme prevents end-to-end, gradient-based training. Here, we propose DeepBlip, the first neural framework for SNMMs, which overcomes this limitation with a novel double optimization trick to enable simultaneous learning of all blip functions. Our DeepBlip seamlessly integrates sequential neural networks like LSTMs or transformers to capture complex temporal dependencies. By design, our method correctly adjusts for time-varying confounding to produce unbiased estimates, and its Neyman-orthogonal loss function ensures robustness to nuisance model misspecification. Finally, we evaluate our DeepBlip across various clinical datasets, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance.",

Here, we propose Apo2Mol, a diffusion-based generative framework for 3D molecule design that explicitly accounts for conformational flexibility in protein binding pockets. To support this, we curate a dataset of over 24,000 experimentally resolved apo-holo structure pairs from the Protein Data Bank, enabling the characterization of protein structure changes associated with ligand binding. Apo2Mol employs a full-atom hierarchical graph-based diffusion model that simultaneously generates 3D ligand molecules and their corresponding holo pocket conformations from input apo states.

Recent advances have demonstrated that SGS models trained via ``online'' end-to-end learning -- where the dynamical solver operating on the filtered equations participates in the training -- can outperform traditional physics-based approaches. Most studies, however, have focused on idealised periodic domains, neglecting the mechanical boundaries present e.g. in planetary interiors. To address this issue, we consider two-dimensional quasi-geostrophic turbulent flow in an axisymmetric bounded domain that we model using a pseudo-spectral differentiable solver, thereby enabling online learning. We examine three configurations, varying the geometry (between an exponential container and a spherical shell) and the rotation rate. Flow is driven by a prescribed analytical forcing, allowing for precise control over the energy injection scale and an exact estimate of the power input. We evaluate the accuracy of the online-trained SGS model against the reference direct numerical simulation using integral quantities and spectral diagnostics. In all configurations, we show that an SGS model trained on data spanning only one turnover time remains stable and accurate over integrations at least a hundred times longer than the training period. Moreover, we demonstrate the model's remarkable ability to reproduce slow processes occurring on time scales far exceeding the training duration, such as the inward drift of jets in the spherical shell. These results suggest a promising path towards developing SGS models for planetary and stellar interior dynamics, including dynamo processes.",

Although recent advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) have enabled automatic bias classification, the extent to which large language models (LLMs) align with human judgment still remains relatively underexplored and not yet well understood. This study aims to present a comparative framework for evaluating the detection of political bias across human annotations and multiple LLMs, including GPT, BERT, RoBERTa, and FLAN. We construct a manually annotated dataset of news articles and assess annotation consistency, bias polarity, and inter-model agreement to quantify divergence between human and model perceptions of bias. Experimental results show that among traditional transformer-based models, RoBERTa achieves the highest alignment with human labels, whereas generative models such as GPT demonstrate the strongest overall agreement with human annotations in a zero-shot setting. Among all transformer-based baselines, our fine-tuned RoBERTa model acquired the highest accuracy and the strongest alignment with human-annotated labels. Our findings highlight systematic differences in how humans and LLMs perceive political slant, underscoring the need for hybrid evaluation frameworks that combine human interpretability with model scalability in automated media bias detection.",

        "abstract": "Seismic sensing has emerged as a promising solution for border surveillance and monitoring; the seismic sensors that are often buried underground are small and cannot be noticed easily, making them difficult for intruders to detect, avoid, or vandalize. This significantly enhances their effectiveness compared to highly visible cameras or fences. However, accurately detecting and distinguishing between overlapping activities that are happening simultaneously, such as human intrusions, animal movements, and vehicle rumbling, remains a major challenge due to the complex and noisy nature of seismic signals. Correctly identifying simultaneous activities is critical because failing to separate them can lead to misclassification, missed detections, and an incomplete understanding of the situation, thereby reducing the reliability of surveillance systems. To tackle this problem, we propose HyMAD (Hybrid Multi-Activity Detection), a deep neural architecture based on spatio-temporal feature fusion. The framework integrates spectral features extracted with SincNet and temporal dependencies modeled by a recurrent neural network (RNN). In addition, HyMAD employs self-attention layers to strengthen intra-modal representations and a cross-modal fusion module to achieve robust multi-label classification of seismic events. e evaluate our approach on a dataset constructed from real-world field recordings collected in the context of border surveillance and monitoring, demonstrating its ability to generalize to complex, simultaneous activity scenarios involving humans, animals, and vehicles.

        "abstract": "We establish the first global convergence result of neural networks for two stage least squares (2SLS) approach in nonparametric instrumental variable regression (NPIV). This is achieved by adopting a lifted perspective through mean-field Langevin dynamics (MFLD), unlike standard MFLD, however, our setting of 2SLS entails a \\emph{bilevel} optimization problem in the space of probability measures. To address this challenge, we leverage the penalty gradient approach recently developed for bilevel optimization which formulates bilevel optimization as a Lagrangian problem. This leads to a novel fully first-order algorithm, termed \\texttt{F$^2$BMLD}. Apart from the convergence bound, we further provide a generalization bound, revealing an inherent trade-off in the choice of the Lagrange multiplier between optimization and statistical guarantees. Finally, we empirically validate the effectiveness of the proposed method on an offline reinforcement learning benchmark.",

        "abstract": "As perception-based controllers for autonomous systems become increasingly popular in the real world, it is important that we can formally verify their safety and performance despite perceptual uncertainty. Unfortunately, the verification of such systems remains challenging, largely due to the complexity of the controllers, which are often nonlinear, nonconvex, learning-based, and/or black-box. Prior works propose verification algorithms that are based on approximate reachability methods, but they often restrict the class of controllers and systems that can be handled or result in overly conservative analyses. Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis is a popular formal verification tool for general nonlinear systems that can compute optimal reachable sets under worst-case system uncertainties; however, its application to perception-based systems is currently underexplored. In this work, we propose RoVer-CoRe, a framework for the Robust Verification of Controllers via HJ Reachability. To the best of our knowledge, RoVer-CoRe is the first HJ reachability-based framework for the verification of perception-based systems under perceptual uncertainty. Our key insight is to concatenate the system controller, observation function, and the state estimation modules to obtain an equivalent closed-loop system that is readily compatible with existing reachability frameworks. Within RoVer-CoRe, we propose novel methods for formal safety verification and robust controller design. We demonstrate the efficacy of the framework in case studies involving aircraft taxiing and NN-based rover navigation. Code is available at the link in the footnote.",
