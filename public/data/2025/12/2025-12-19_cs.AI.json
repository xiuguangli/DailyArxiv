        "abstract": "We present Anubuddhi, a multi-agent AI system that designs and simulates quantum optics experiments from natural language prompts without requiring specialized programming knowledge. The system composes optical layouts by arranging components from a three-tier toolbox via semantic retrieval, then validates designs through physics simulation with convergent refinement. The architecture combines intent routing, knowledge-augmented generation, and dual-mode validation (QuTiP and FreeSim). We evaluated 13 experiments spanning fundamental optics (Hong-Ou-Mandel interference, Michelson/Mach-Zehnder interferometry, Bell states, delayed-choice quantum eraser), quantum information protocols (BB84 QKD, Franson interferometry, GHZ states, quantum teleportation, hyperentanglement), and advanced technologies (boson sampling, electromagnetically induced transparency, frequency conversion). The system achieves design-simulation alignment scores of 8--9/10, with simulations faithfully modeling intended physics. A critical finding distinguishes structural correctness from quantitative accuracy: high alignment confirms correct physics architecture, while numerical predictions require expert review. Free-form simulation outperformed constrained frameworks for 11/13 experiments, revealing that quantum optics diversity demands flexible mathematical representations. The system democratizes computational experiment design for research and pedagogy, producing strong initial designs users can iteratively refine through conversation.",

        "abstract": "Traditional ethical frameworks often struggle to model decision-making under uncertainty, treating it as a simple constraint on action. This paper introduces the Principle of Proportional Duty (PPD), a novel framework that models how ethical responsibility scales with an agent's epistemic state. The framework reveals that moral duty is not lost to uncertainty but transforms: as uncertainty increases, Action Duty (the duty to act decisively) is proportionally converted into Repair Duty (the active duty to verify, inquire, and resolve uncertainty). This dynamic is expressed by the equation D_total = K[(1-HI) + HI * g(C_signal)], where Total Duty is a function of Knowledge (K), Humility/Uncertainty (HI), and Contextual Signal Strength (C_signal). Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that systems maintaining a baseline humility coefficient (lambda > 0) produce more stable duty allocations and reduce the risk of overconfident decision-making. By formalizing humility as a system parameter, the PPD offers a mathematically tractable approach to moral responsibility that could inform the development of auditable AI decision systems. This paper applies the framework across four domains, clinical ethics, recipient-rights law, economic governance, and artificial intelligence, to demonstrate its cross-disciplinary validity. The findings suggest that proportional duty serves as a stabilizing principle within complex systems, preventing both overreach and omission by dynamically balancing epistemic confidence against contextual risk.",

Unlike unconstrained text-to-3D approaches, our method operates within a discrete parts vocabulary, enforcing geometric validity, connection constraints, and buildability ordering. Using LDraw as a text-rich intermediate representation, we demonstrate that large language models can be guided with tools to produce valid step-by-step construction sequences and assembly instructions for brick-based prototypes of more than 3000 assembly parts. We introduce a Python library for programmatic model generation and evaluate buildable outputs on complex satellites, aircraft, and architectural domains. The approach aims for demonstrable scalability, modularity, and fidelity that bridges the gap between semantic design intent and manufacturable output. Physical prototyping follows from natural language specifications. The work proposes a novel elemental lingua franca as a key missing piece from the previous pixel-based diffusion methods or computer-aided design (CAD) models that fail to support complex assembly instructions or component exchange. Across four original designs, this novel \"bag of bricks\" method thus functions as a physical API: a constrained vocabulary connecting precisely oriented brick locations to a \"bag of words\" through which arbitrary functional requirements compile into material reality.

The approach mirrors the way in which epidemiologists enable public health interventions through statistical evidence before molecular mechanisms are understood. This bypasses the problem of model complexity which plagues current interpretability methods (such as SHAP and mechanistic interpretability) at the scale of deployed models. AI Epidemiology achieves this population-level surveillance by standardising capture of AI-expert interactions into structured assessment fields: risk level, alignment score, and accuracy score. These function as exposure variables which predict output failure through statistical associations, much like cholesterol and blood pressure act as exposure variables predicting cardiac events. Output-failure associations are subsequently validated against expert overrides and real-world outcomes. The framework places zero burden on experts and provides automatic audit trails by passively tracking expert convergence and divergence with AI recommendations. Since it analyses outputs rather than internal model computations, it also provides governance continuity when institutions update models and switch vendors. Finally, by providing reliability scores and semantic assessments (e.g. 'this recommendation resembles 500 cases overridden by experts due to guideline violations'), it enables experts and institutions to detect unreliable AI outputs before they cause harm. This democratises AI oversight by enabling domain experts to govern AI systems without requiring machine learning expertise.",

        "abstract": "Large Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed to automate complex workflows in mobile and desktop environments. However, current model-centric agent architectures struggle to self-evolve post-deployment: improving personalization, capability, and efficiency typically requires continuous model retraining/fine-tuning, which incurs prohibitive computational overheads and suffers from an inherent trade-off between model accuracy and inference efficiency. To enable iterative self-evolution without model retraining, we propose MOBIMEM, a memory-centric agent system. MOBIMEM first introduces three specialized memory primitives to decouple agent evolution from model weights: (1) Profile Memory uses a lightweight distance-graph (DisGraph) structure to align with user preferences, resolving the accuracy-latency trade-off in user profile retrieval; (2) Experience Memory employs multi-level templates to instantiate execution logic for new tasks, ensuring capability generalization; and (3) Action Memory records fine-grained interaction sequences, reducing the reliance on expensive model inference. Building upon this memory architecture, MOBIMEM further integrates a suite of OS-inspired services to orchestrate execution: a scheduler that coordinates parallel sub-task execution and memory operations; an agent record-and-replay (AgentRR) mechanism that enables safe and efficient action reuse; and a context-aware exception handling that ensures graceful recovery from user interruptions and runtime errors. Evaluation on AndroidWorld and top-50 apps shows that MOBIMEM achieves 83.1% profile alignment with 23.83 ms retrieval time (280x faster than GraphRAG baselines), improves task success rates by up to 50.3%, and reduces end-to-end latency by up to 9x on mobile devices.",

Effective CE triage requires adaptive decisions that balance retained value against the costs and constraints of processing and labour. This paper presents a novel decision-making framework as a simple deterministic solver over a state-augmented Disassembly Sequencing Planning (DSP) graph. By encoding the disassembly history into the state, our framework enforces the Markov property, enabling optimal, recursive evaluation by ensuring each decision only depends on the previous state. The triage decision involves choices between continuing disassembly or committing to a CE option. The model integrates condition-aware utility based on diagnostic health scores and complex operational constraints. We demonstrate the framework's flexibility with a worked example: the hierarchical triage of electric vehicle (EV) batteries, where decisions are driven by the recursive valuation of components. The example illustrates how a unified formalism enables the accommodation of varying mechanical complexity, safety requirements, and economic drivers. This unified formalism therefore provides a tractable and generalisable foundation for optimising CE triage decisions across diverse products and operational contexts.",

Two Llama models (70B and 8B) were assessed using a multi-dimensional safety framework covering diagnostic restraint, referral adherence, hedging, and emergency recognition. Adversarial queries incorporated parental pressure patterns, including urgency, economic barriers, and challenges to disclaimers. Mean safety score was 5.50/15 (SD=2.41). The 70B model outperformed the 8B model (6.26 vs 4.95, p<0.001) with lower critical failures (4.8% vs 12.0%, p=0.02). Adversarial queries reduced safety by 8% (p=0.03), with urgency causing the largest drop (-1.40). Vulnerabilities appeared in seizures (33.3% inappropriate diagnosis) and post-vaccination queries. Hedging strongly correlated with safety (r=0.68, p<0.001), while emergency recognition was absent.

Darth Vecdor (DV) was designed to extract this knowledge into a structured, terminology-mapped, SQL database (\"knowledge base\" or \"knowledge graph\"). Knowledge graphs may be useful in many domains, including healthcare. Although one might query an LLM directly rather than a SQL-based knowledge graph, concerns such as cost, speed, safety, and confidence may arise, especially in high-volume operations. These may be mitigated when the information is pre-extracted from the LLM and becomes query-able through a standard database. However, the author found the need to address several issues. These included erroneous, off-topic, free-text, overly general, and inconsistent LLM responses, as well as allowing for multi-element responses. DV was built with features intended to mitigate these issues. To facilitate ease of use, and to allow for prompt engineering by those with domain expertise but little technical background, DV provides a simple, browser-based graphical user interface. DV has been released as free, open-source, extensible software, on an \"as is\" basis, without warranties or conditions of any kind, either express or implied. Users need to be cognizant of the potential risks and benefits of using DV and its outputs, and users are responsible for ensuring any use is safe and effective. DV should be assumed to have bugs, potentially very serious ones. However, the author hopes that appropriate use of current and future versions of DV and its outputs can help improve healthcare.",

Most of the standard RAG frameworks regard all retrieved information as equally reliable, overlooking the varying credibility and interconnected nature of large textual corpora. GraphRAG approaches offer potential improvement to RAG systems by integrating knowledge graphs, which structure information into nodes and edges, capture entity relationships, and enable multi-step logical traversal. However, GraphRAG is not always an ideal solution as it depends on high-quality graph representations of the corpus, which requires either pre-existing knowledge graphs that are expensive to build and update, or automated graph construction pipelines that are often unreliable. Moreover, systems following this paradigm typically use large language models to guide graph traversal and evidence retrieval, leading to challenges similar to those encountered with standard RAG. In this paper, we propose a novel RAG framework that employs the spreading activation algorithm to retrieve information from a corpus of documents interconnected by automatically constructed knowledge graphs, thereby enhancing the performance of large language models on complex tasks such as multi-hop question answering. Experiments show that our method achieves better or comparable performance to iterative RAG methodologies, while also being easily integrable as a plug-and-play module with a wide range of RAG-based approaches. Combining our method with chain-of-thought iterative retrieval yields up to a 39\\% absolute gain in answer correctness compared to naive RAG, achieving these results with small open-weight language models and highlighting its effectiveness in resource-constrained settings.",

While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities across diverse tasks, their extensive computational requirements make them cost-prohibitive for routine enterprise use. This limitation motivates the exploration of Small Language Models (SLMs), which can deliver comparable performance in targeted applications while drastically reducing infrastructure overhead (Irugalbandara et al., 2023). In this work, we investigate the feasibility of replacing LLM-driven workflows with optimized SLMs. We trained a domain-adapted SLM to execute representative tasks traditionally handled by LLMs, such as document summarization, query answering, and structured data interpretation. As part of the experiment, we investigated the fine-tuning of facebook/opt-350m model (single epoch only) using the Hugging Face TRL (Transformer Reinforcement Learning), specifically the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) trainer. The OPT-350M model was released by Meta AI in 2022 as part of the OPT (Open Pretrained Transformer) family of models. Similar studies demonstrate that even models at the 350M parameter scale can meaningfully contribute to instruction-tuning pipelines (Mekala et al., 2024). Experimental results demonstrated that our fine-tuned SLM achieves exceptional performance with a 77.55\\% pass rate on ToolBench evaluation, significantly outperforming all baseline models including ChatGPT-CoT (26.00\\%), ToolLLaMA-DFS (30.18\\%), and ToolLLaMA-CoT (16.27\\%). These findings emphasize that thoughtful design and targeted training of SLMs can significantly lower barriers to adoption, enabling cost-effective, large-scale integration of generative AI into production systems.",

        "abstract": "The proliferation of time series foundation models has created a landscape where no single method achieves consistent superiority, framing the central challenge not as finding the best model, but as orchestrating an optimal ensemble with interpretability. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer powerful reasoning capabilities, their direct application to time series forecasting has proven ineffective. We address this gap by repositioning the LLM as an intelligent judge that evaluates, explains, and strategically coordinates an ensemble of foundation models. To overcome the LLM's inherent lack of domain-specific knowledge on time series, we introduce an R1-style finetuning process, guided by SHAP-based faithfulness scores, which teaches the model to interpret ensemble weights as meaningful causal statements about temporal dynamics. The trained agent then engages in iterative, multi-turn conversations to perform forward-looking assessments, provide causally-grounded explanations for its weighting decisions, and adaptively refine the optimization strategy. Validated on the GIFT-Eval benchmark on 23 datasets across 97 settings, our approach significantly outperforms leading time series foundation models on both CRPS and MASE metrics, establishing new state-of-the-art results.",

While large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across diverse tasks, their epistemic calibration remains poorly understood. We introduce \\textbf{KalshiBench}, a benchmark of 300 prediction market questions from Kalshi, a CFTC-regulated exchange, with verifiable real-world outcomes occurring after model training cutoffs. Unlike traditional benchmarks measuring accuracy on static knowledge, KalshiBench evaluates whether models can appropriately quantify uncertainty about genuinely unknown future events. We evaluate five frontier models -- Claude Opus 4.5, GPT-5.2, DeepSeek-V3.2, Qwen3-235B, and Kimi-K2 -- and find \\textbf{systematic overconfidence across all models}. Even the best-calibrated model (Claude Opus 4.5, ECE=0.120) shows substantial calibration errors, while reasoning-enhanced models like GPT-5.2-XHigh exhibit \\emph{worse} calibration (ECE=0.395) despite comparable accuracy. Critically, only one model achieves a positive Brier Skill Score, indicating most models perform worse than simply predicting base rates. Our findings suggest that scaling and enhanced reasoning do not automatically confer calibration benefits, highlighting epistemic calibration as a distinct capability requiring targeted development.",

They use GenAI to clarify concepts, solve complex problems, and, in some cases, complete assignments by copying and pasting model-generated contents. While GenAI has the potential to enhance learning experience, it also raises concerns around misinformation, hallucinated outputs, and its potential to undermine critical thinking and problem-solving skills. In response, many universities, colleges, departments, and instructors have begun to develop and adopt policies to guide responsible integration of GenAI into learning environments. However, these policies vary widely across institutions and contexts, and their evolving nature often leaves students uncertain about expectations and best practices. To address this challenge, the authors designed and implemented an automated system for discovering and categorizing AI-related policies found in course syllabi and institutional policy websites. The system combines unsupervised topic modeling techniques to identify key policy themes with large language models (LLMs) to classify the level of GenAI allowance and other requirements in policy texts. The developed application achieved a coherence score of 0.73 for topic discovery. In addition, GPT-4.0-based classification of policy categories achieved precision between 0.92 and 0.97, and recall between 0.85 and 0.97 across eight identified topics. By providing structured and interpretable policy information, this tool promotes the safe, equitable, and pedagogically aligned use of GenAI technologies in education. Furthermore, the system can be integrated into educational technology platforms to help students understand and comply with relevant guidelines.",

Under this framework, we present WeMusic-Agent-M1, an agentic model that internalizes extensive musical knowledge via continued pretraining on 50B music-related corpus while acquiring the ability to invoke external tools when necessary. Additionally, considering the lack of open-source benchmarks for conversational music recommendation, we also construct a benchmark for personalized music recommendations derived from real-world data in WeChat Listen.

Unlike classical K-means and constrained K-means, WKHM admits a direct interpretation in wireless networks: its weights are exactly equivalent to fractional user association based on received signal strength. We establish rigorous convergence guarantees under both deterministic and stochastic settings, addressing key technical challenges arising from non-convexity and random initialization. Specifically, we prove monotone descent to a local minimum under fixed initialization, convergence in probability under Binomial Point Process (BPP) initialization, and almost sure convergence under mild decay conditions. These results provide the first stochastic convergence guarantees for harmonic-mean-based clustering. Finally, through extensive simulations with diverse user distributions, we show that WKHM achieves a superior tradeoff between minimum signal strength and load fairness compared to classical and modern clustering baselines, making it a principled tool for joint radio node placement and user association in wireless networks.",

Traditional methods for PDE solving are cumbersome, relying on manual setup and domain expertise. While Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINNs) introduced end-to-end neural network-based solutions, and frameworks like DeepXDE further enhanced automation, these approaches still depend on expert knowledge and lack full autonomy. In this work, we frame PDE solving as tool invocation via LLM-driven agents and introduce PDE-Agent, the first toolchain-augmented multi-agent collaboration framework, inheriting the reasoning capacity of LLMs and the controllability of external tools and enabling automated PDE solving from natural language descriptions. PDE-Agent leverages the strengths of multi-agent and multi-tool collaboration through two key innovations: (1) A Prog-Act framework with graph memory for multi-agent collaboration, which enables effective dynamic planning and error correction via dual-loop mechanisms (localized fixes and global revisions). (2) A Resource-Pool integrated with a tool-parameter separation mechanism for multi-tool collaboration. This centralizes the management of runtime artifacts and resolves inter-tool dependency gaps in existing frameworks. To validate and evaluate this new paradigm for PDE solving , we develop PDE-Bench, a multi-type PDE Benchmark for agent-based tool collaborative solving, and propose multi-level metrics for assessing tool coordination. Evaluations verify that PDE-Agent exhibits superior applicability and performance in complex multi-step, cross-step dependent tasks. This new paradigm of toolchain-augmented multi-agent PDE solving will further advance future developments in automated scientific computing.

Prevailing efforts to address this through enhancing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are trapped in a dilemma: template-based datasets are scalable but structurally rigid, while manual annotation is linguistically diverse but unscalable and, critically, computationally imprecise. We introduce SPRITE, a novel framework that overcomes this dilemma by leveraging simulators and large models to programmatically synthesize scalable, diverse, and high-quality spatial reasoning data. The core innovation of SPRITE is to reframe ground-truth generation as a code-generation task. We utilize LLMs to compile complex spatial questions into executable programs, which are then verified against high-precision scene meta-information extracted from simulators. This ensures our ground truth is both computationally precise and verifiable, while the generative power of LLMs provides vast linguistic diversity. Leveraging this pipeline, we have curated a dataset encompassing 3 simulators, 11k+ scenes, and 300k+ image/video instruction-tuning pairs. We demonstrate that a VLM trained on our data achieves significant performance gains on multiple spatial benchmarks and outperforms other open-source datasets of equivalent size. Furthermore, a scalability analysis confirms our hypothesis that overcoming the low-diversity nature of traditional template methods is essential for building robust, generalizable spatial intelligence. We will make the SPRITE framework code and the full 300k+ dataset publicly available to facilitate future research in spatial intelligence.",

Yet standard schemes (linear weight soups, task vectors, and Fisher-weighted averaging) can preserve loss while quietly destroying alignment. We argue that merging is not a numerical trick but a geometry-constrained operation around an already-aligned anchor: fusion must be steered to respect safety geometry, not validated post hoc. We introduce AlignMerge, a geometry-aware merging framework that makes alignment an explicit invariant. In a local Fisher chart around an instruction-tuned base, we estimate an alignment subspace with projector P_A and optimize: L_AlignMerge = L_geo + lambda_align * L_align + lambda_bud * L_bud, where L_geo keeps the merge close to its experts in Fisher-Rao geometry, L_align penalizes motion along alignment-sensitive directions, and L_bud enforces a soft alignment budget. As the alignment functional we use the decoding-invariant Alignment Quality Index (AQI), a latent-space criterion that captures how cleanly aligned and misaligned behaviors separate in representation space. Across five model families (LLaMA-3 8B, Mistral 7B, Qwen 2, Phi-3.5, Gemma 2), merging safety anchors with task experts, AlignMerge improves alignment metrics (AQI, toxicity, LLM-judge alignment) while matching or exceeding the best expert on instruction-following, reasoning, and helpfulness. It also exhibits smaller alignment-subspace drift and fewer budget violations than Fisher soups, TIES, SafeMerge, and MergeAlign. These results make alignment-preserving merging a first-class design goal and suggest a path to geometry-aware composition of future foundation models.",

These scenarios are central to multimodal audio-video understanding, where models must jointly reason over audio and visual streams in applications such as conversational video assistants and meeting analytics. We introduce AMUSE, a benchmark designed around tasks that are inherently agentic, requiring models to decompose complex audio-visual interactions into planning, grounding, and reflection steps. It evaluates MLLMs across three modes zero-shot, guided, and agentic and six task families, including spatio-temporal speaker grounding and multimodal dialogue summarization. Across all modes, current models exhibit weak multi-speaker reasoning and inconsistent behavior under both non-agentic and agentic evaluation. Motivated by the inherently agentic nature of these tasks and recent advances in LLM agents, we propose RAFT, a data-efficient agentic alignment framework that integrates reward optimization with intrinsic multimodal self-evaluation as reward and selective parameter adaptation for data and parameter efficient updates. Using RAFT, we achieve up to 39.52\\% relative improvement in accuracy on our benchmark.

In this work, we propose an \\textbf{Agent-side Approach} that empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) to actively align their \\textit{Cognitive Timeline} with the physical world. By extending the Code-as-Action paradigm to the temporal domain, agents utilize semantic priors and In-Context Learning (ICL) to predict precise waiting durations (\\texttt{this http URL(t)}), effectively synchronizing with asynchronous environment without exhaustive checking. Experiments in a simulated Kubernetes cluster demonstrate that agents can precisely calibrate their internal clocks to minimize both query overhead and execution latency, validating that temporal awareness is a learnable capability essential for autonomous evolution in open-ended environments.",

However, deployer-written policies in natural language are ambiguous and context dependent, so they map poorly to machine-checkable rules, and runtime enforcement is unreliable. Expressing safety policies as sequents, we propose \\textsc{QuadSentinel}, a four-agent guard (state tracker, policy verifier, threat watcher, and referee) that compiles these policies into machine-checkable rules built from predicates over observable state and enforces them online. Referee logic plus an efficient top-$k$ predicate updater keeps costs low by prioritizing checks and resolving conflicts hierarchically. Measured on ST-WebAgentBench (ICML CUA~'25) and AgentHarm (ICLR~'25), \\textsc{QuadSentinel} improves guardrail accuracy and rule recall while reducing false positives. Against single-agent baselines such as ShieldAgent (ICML~'25), it yields better overall safety control. Near-term deployments can adopt this pattern without modifying core agents by keeping policies separate and machine-checkable. Our code will be made publicly available at this https URL.",

        "abstract": "With VLM-powered computer-using agents (CUAs) becoming increasingly capable at graphical user interface (GUI) navigation and manipulation, reliable step-level decision-making has emerged as a key bottleneck for real-world deployment. In long-horizon workflows, errors accumulate quickly and irreversible actions can cause unintended consequences, motivating critic models that assess each action before execution. While critic models offer a promising solution, their effectiveness is hindered by the lack of diverse, high-quality GUI feedback data and public critic benchmarks for step-level evaluation in computer use. To bridge these gaps, we introduce OS-Oracle that makes three core contributions: (1) a scalable data pipeline for synthesizing cross-platform GUI critic data; (2) a two-stage training paradigm combining supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and consistency-preserving group relative policy optimization (CP-GRPO); (3) OS-Critic Bench, a holistic benchmark for evaluating critic model performance across Mobile, Web, and Desktop platforms. Leveraging this framework, we curate a high-quality dataset containing 310k critic samples. The resulting critic model, OS-Oracle-7B, achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source VLMs on OS-Critic Bench, and surpasses proprietary models on the mobile domain. Furthermore, when serving as a pre-critic, OS-Oracle-7B improves the performance of native GUI agents such as UI-TARS-1.5-7B in OSWorld and AndroidWorld environments.

Although naturally complementary, these two information streams are highly heterogeneous in both paradigm and reasoning, making it difficult for existing methods to unify them or effectively model their cross-level interactions. To address this gap, we propose ForenAgent, a multi-round interactive IFD framework that enables MLLMs to autonomously generate, execute, and iteratively refine Python-based low-level tools around the detection objective, thereby achieving more flexible and interpretable forgery analysis. ForenAgent follows a two-stage training pipeline combining Cold Start and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning to enhance its tool interaction capability and reasoning adaptability progressively. Inspired by human reasoning, we design a dynamic reasoning loop comprising global perception, local focusing, iterative probing, and holistic adjudication, and instantiate it as both a data-sampling strategy and a task-aligned process reward. For systematic training and evaluation, we construct FABench, a heterogeneous, high-quality agent-forensics dataset comprising 100k images and approximately 200k agent-interaction question-answer pairs. Experiments show that ForenAgent exhibits emergent tool-use competence and reflective reasoning on challenging IFD tasks when assisted by low-level tools, charting a promising route toward general-purpose IFD.

We further decompose these into tool-execution-signaled and agent-output-signaled forms of agent adaptation, as well as agent-agnostic and agent-supervised forms of tool adaptation. We demonstrate that this framework helps clarify the design space of adaptation strategies in agentic AI, makes their trade-offs explicit, and provides practical guidance for selecting or switching among strategies during system design. We then review the representative approaches in each category, analyze their strengths and limitations, and highlight key open challenges and future opportunities.

Proof of Quality (PoQ) replaces cryptographic verification of computation with consensus over output quality, but the original formulation ignores heterogeneous computational costs across inference and evaluator nodes. This paper introduces a cost-aware PoQ framework that integrates explicit efficiency measurements into the reward mechanism for both types of nodes. The design combines ground truth token level F1, lightweight learned evaluators, and GPT based judgments within a unified evaluation pipeline, and adopts a linear reward function that balances normalized quality and cost. Experiments on extractive question answering and abstractive summarization use five instruction tuned LLMs ranging from TinyLlama-1.1B to Llama-3.2-3B and three evaluation models spanning cross encoder and bi encoder architectures. Results show that a semantic textual similarity bi encoder achieves much higher correlation with both ground truth and GPT scores than cross encoders, indicating that evaluator architecture is a critical design choice for PoQ. Quality-cost analysis further reveals that the largest models in the pool are also the most efficient in terms of quality per unit latency. Monte Carlo simulations over 5\\,000 PoQ rounds demonstrate that the cost-aware reward scheme consistently assigns higher average rewards to high quality low cost inference models and to efficient evaluators, while penalizing slow low quality nodes. These findings suggest that cost-aware PoQ provides a practical foundation for economically sustainable decentralized LLM inference.",

We argue that while current AI may influence physics, physics has significantly more to offer this generation of AI. Current architectures - large language models, reasoning models, and agentic AI - can depend on trillions of meaningless parameters, suffer from distributional bias, lack uncertainty quantification, provide no mechanistic insights, and fail to capture even elementary scientific laws. We review critiques of these limits, highlight opportunities in quantum AI and analogue computing, and lay down a roadmap for the adoption of 'Big AI': a synthesis of theory-based rigour with the flexibility of machine learning.",

PCIA generates a random population to find the best route toward the destination, similar to swarm-based algorithms. Each particle represents a path toward the destination.

However, imaginary opponents of MARL algorithms are practically configured and controlled in a fixed built-in AI mode, which causes less diversity and versatility in algorithm evaluation. To address this issue, in this work, we establish a multi-agent algorithm-vs-algorithm environment, named StarCraft II battle arena (SC2BA), to refresh the benchmarking of MARL algorithms in an adversary paradigm. Taking StarCraft as infrastructure, the SC2BA environment is specifically created for inter-algorithm adversary with the consideration of fairness, usability and customizability, and meantime an adversarial PyMARL (APyMARL) library is developed with easy-to-use interfaces/modules. Grounding in SC2BA, we benchmark those classic MARL algorithms in two types of adversarial modes: dual-algorithm paired adversary and multi-algorithm mixed adversary, where the former conducts the adversary of pairwise algorithms while the latter focuses on the adversary to multiple behaviors from a group of algorithms. The extensive benchmark experiments exhibit some thought-provoking observations/problems in the effectivity, sensibility and scalability of these completed algorithms.

Here, we present TimeSeries2Report (TS2R), a prompting framework that converts raw lithium-ion battery operational time-series into structured, semantically enriched reports, enabling LLMs to reason, predict, and make decisions in BESS management scenarios. TS2R encodes short-term temporal dynamics into natural language through a combination of segmentation, semantic abstraction, and rule-based interpretation, effectively bridging low-level sensor signals with high-level contextual insights. We benchmark TS2R across both lab-scale and real-world datasets, evaluating report quality and downstream task performance in anomaly detection, state-of-charge prediction, and charging/discharging management. Compared with vision-, embedding-, and text-based prompting baselines, report-based prompting via TS2R consistently improves LLM performance in terms of across accuracy, robustness, and explainability metrics. Notably, TS2R-integrated LLMs achieve expert-level decision quality and predictive consistency without retraining or architecture modification, establishing a practical path for adaptive, LLM-driven battery intelligence.",

This work identifies these mismatches and proposes cuPilot, a strategy-coordinated multi-agent framework that introduces strategy as an intermediate semantic representation for kernel evolution. Key contributions include a strategy-coordinated evolution algorithm, roofline-guided prompting, and strategy-level population initialization. Experimental results show that the generated kernels by cuPilot achieve an average speed up of 3.09$\\times$ over PyTorch on a benchmark of 100 kernels. On the GEMM tasks, cuPilot showcases sophisticated optimizations and achieves high utilization of critical hardware units. The generated kernels are open-sourced at this https URL.",

Despite progress in improving visual realism through advanced simulators and generative AI, recent studies reveal that pixel-level fidelity alone does not ensure reliable transfer from simulation to the real world. What truly matters is whether the system-under-test (SUT) bases its decisions on the same causal evidence in both real and simulated environments - not just whether images \"look real\" to humans. This paper addresses the lack of such a behavior-grounded fidelity measure by introducing Decisive Feature Fidelity (DFF), a new SUT-specific metric that extends the existing fidelity spectrum to capture mechanism parity - the agreement in causal evidence underlying the SUT's decisions across domains. DFF leverages explainable-AI (XAI) methods to identify and compare the decisive features driving the SUT's outputs for matched real-synthetic pairs. We further propose practical estimators based on counterfactual explanations, along with a DFF-guided calibration scheme to enhance simulator fidelity. Experiments on 2126 matched KITTI-VirtualKITTI2 pairs demonstrate that DFF reveals discrepancies overlooked by conventional output-value fidelity. Furthermore, results show that DFF-guided calibration improves decisive-feature and input-level fidelity without sacrificing output value fidelity across diverse SUTs.",

Although graphics processors dominate modern artificial-intelligence deployment, most consumer hardware--including laptops, desktops, industrial controllers, and embedded systems--relies on central processing units. Despite this, the computational laws governing central-processing-unit-only inference for local language and vision-language workloads remain largely unexplored. We systematically benchmark large language and vision-language models on two representative central-processing-unit tiers widely used for local inference: a MacBook Pro M2, reflecting mainstream laptop-class deployment, and a Raspberry Pi 5, representing constrained, low-power embedded settings. Using a unified methodology based on continuous sampling of processor and memory usage together with area-under-curve integration, we characterize how computational load scales with input text length for language models and with image resolution for vision-language models. We uncover two empirical scaling laws: (1) computational cost for language-model inference scales approximately linearly with token length; and (2) vision-language models exhibit a preprocessing-driven \"resolution knee\", where compute remains constant above an internal resolution clamp and decreases sharply below it. Beyond these laws, we show that quantum-inspired compression reduces processor and memory usage by up to 71.9% and energy consumption by up to 62%, while preserving or improving semantic accuracy. These results provide a systematic quantification of multimodal central-processing-unit-only scaling for local language and vision-language workloads, and they identify model compression and input-resolution preprocessing as effective, low-cost levers for sustainable edge inference.",

To address this gap, we introduce Needle in the Web, a novel benchmark specifically designed to evaluate modern search agents and LLM-based systems on their ability to retrieve and reason over real-world web content in response to ambiguous, exploratory queries under varying levels of difficulty. Needle in the Web comprises 663 questions spanning seven distinct domains. To ensure high query quality and answer uniqueness, we employ a flexible methodology that reliably generates queries of controllable difficulty based on factual claims of web contents. We benchmark three leading LLMs and three agent-based search systems on Needle in the Web, finding that most models struggle: many achieve below 35% accuracy, and none consistently excel across domains or difficulty levels. These findings reveal that Needle in the Web presents a significant challenge for current search systems and highlights the open problem of effective fuzzy retrieval under semantic ambiguity.",

During inference, the method requires only a single log-probability computation over the probe prefixes to produce a harmfulness score and apply a threshold, without invoking any additional models or multi-stage inference. To further enhance the discriminative power of the prefixes, we design an efficient prefix construction algorithm that automatically discovers highly informative prefixes, substantially improving detection performance.

We are witnessing the rise of a dangerous literacy gap, where a focus on the functional, operational skills of using AI tools is eclipsing the development of critical and ethical reasoning about them. This position paper argues for a systemic shift toward comprehensive AI literacy that centers human agency - the empowered capacity for intentional, critical, and responsible choice. This principle applies to all stakeholders in the educational ecosystem: it is the student's agency to question, create with, or consciously decide not to use AI based on the task; it is the teacher's agency to design learning experiences that align with instructional values, rather than ceding pedagogical control to a tool. True literacy involves teaching about agency itself, framing technology not as an inevitability to be adopted, but as a choice to be made. This requires a deep commitment to critical thinking and a robust understanding of epistemology. Through the AI Literacy, Fluency, and Competency frameworks described in this paper, educators and students will become agents in their own human-centric approaches to AI, providing necessary pathways to clearly articulate the intentions informing decisions and attitudes toward AI and the impact of these decisions on academic work, career, and society.",

        "abstract": "This research stems from the urgency to automate the thematic grouping of hadith in line with the growing digitalization of Islamic texts. Based on a literature review, the unsupervised learning approach with the Apriori algorithm has proven effective in identifying association patterns and semantic relations in unlabeled text data. The dataset used is the Indonesian Translation of the hadith of Bukhari, which first goes through preprocessing stages including case folding, punctuation cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming. Next, an association rule mining analysis was conducted using the Apriori algorithm with support, confidence, and lift parameters. The results show the existence of meaningful association patterns such as the relationship between rakaat-prayer, verse-revelation, and hadith-story, which describe the themes of worship, revelation, and hadith narration. These findings demonstrate that the Apriori algorithm has the ability to automatically uncover latent semantic relationships, while contributing to the development of digital Islamic studies and technology-based learning systems.",

We systematically compare single-agent and multi-agent pipelines on four visual math benchmarks: Geometry3K, MathVerse, OlympiadBench, and We-Math. For open-source models, multi-agent consistently improves performance. For example, Qwen-2.5-VL (7B) gains +6.8 points and Qwen-2.5-VL (32B) gains +3.3 on Geometry3K, and both Qwen-2.5-VL variants see further gains on OlympiadBench and We-Math. In contrast, the closed-source Gemini-2.0-Flash generally performs better in single-agent mode on classic benchmarks, while multi-agent yields only modest improvements on the newer We-Math dataset. These findings show that multi-agent pipelines provide clear benefits for open-source models and can assist strong proprietary systems on newer, less familiar benchmarks, but agentic decomposition is not universally optimal.

Rather than adding another digital tool, large language models reconfigure reading, writing, and coding into hybrid human-AI workflows, raising concerns about epistemic automation, cognitive offloading, and the de-professiona\\-lisation of teachers. This paper proposes \\emph{Cyber Humanism in Education} as a framework for reclaiming human agency in this landscape. We conceptualise AI-enabled learning environments as socio-technical infrastructures co-authored by humans and machines, and position educators and learners as epistemic agents and \\emph{algorithmic citizens} who have both the right and the responsibility to shape these infrastructures. We articulate three pillars for cyber-humanist design, \\emph{reflexive competence}, \\emph{algorithmic citizenship}, and \\emph{dialogic design}, and relate them to major international digital and AI competence frameworks. We then present higher-education case studies that operationalise these ideas through \\emph{prompt-based learning} and a new \\emph{Conversational AI Educator} certification within the EPICT ecosystem. The findings show how such practices can strengthen epistemic agency while surfacing tensions around workload, equity, and governance, and outline implications for the future of AI-rich, human-centred education.",

The machine learning module captured temporal medication trends, while the large language model interpreted ambiguous dosing records and free-text clinical notes. Integrating these modalities improved sensitivity and interpretability. Our framework achieved an accuracy of 0.874 (48h) and 0.917 (72h), with an improvement in sensitivity of 8.6% and 10.4% due to the augmentation of large language model.

CitySeeker includes 6,440 trajectories across 8 cities, capturing diverse visual characteristics and implicit needs in 7 goal-driven scenarios. Extensive experiments reveal that even top-performing models (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL-32B-Instruct) achieve only 21.1% task completion. We find key bottlenecks in error accumulation in long-horizon reasoning, inadequate spatial cognition, and deficient experiential recall. To further analyze them, we investigate a series of exploratory strategies-Backtracking Mechanisms, Enriching Spatial Cognition, and Memory-Based Retrieval (BCR), inspired by human cognitive mapping's emphasis on iterative observation-reasoning cycles and adaptive path optimization. Our analysis provides actionable insights for developing VLMs with robust spatial intelligence required for tackling \"last-mile\" navigation challenges.",

Evaluating TOGGLE on four LLM architectures (GPT-2, DeepSeek-V2 7B, LLaMA 3 8B, and Mistral 7B), we achieve up to 3.3x reduction in computational costs (FLOPs) and up to a 68.8% reduction in model size while satisfying all linguistic properties.

Here we argue that this patchwork AGI hypothesis needs to be given serious consideration, and should inform the development of corresponding safeguards and mitigations. The rapid deployment of advanced AI agents with tool-use capabilities and the ability to communicate and coordinate makes this an urgent safety consideration. We therefore propose a framework for distributional AGI safety that moves beyond evaluating and aligning individual agents. This framework centers on the design and implementation of virtual agentic sandbox economies (impermeable or semi-permeable), where agent-to-agent transactions are governed by robust market mechanisms, coupled with appropriate auditability, reputation management, and oversight to mitigate collective risks.",

In this paper, we introduce Generative Adversarial Reasoner, an on-policy joint training framework designed to enhance reasoning by co-evolving an LLM reasoner and an LLM-based discriminator through adversarial reinforcement learning. A compute-efficient review schedule partitions each reasoning chain into logically complete slices of comparable length, and the discriminator evaluates each slice's soundness with concise, structured justifications. Learning couples complementary signals: the LLM reasoner is rewarded for logically consistent steps that yield correct answers, while the discriminator earns rewards for correctly detecting errors or distinguishing traces in the reasoning process. This produces dense, well-calibrated, on-policy step-level rewards that supplement sparse exact-match signals, improving credit assignment, increasing sample efficiency, and enhancing overall reasoning quality of LLMs. Across various mathematical benchmarks, the method delivers consistent gains over strong baselines with standard RL post-training. Specifically, on AIME24, we improve DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B from 54.0 to 61.3 (+7.3) and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B from 43.7 to 53.7 (+10.0).

To address this limitation, this study proposes a weakly supervised deep learning framework for pneumonia classification and localization using Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM). Instead of relying on costly pixel-level annotations, the proposed method utilizes image-level labels to generate clinically meaningful heatmaps that highlight pneumonia-affected regions. Furthermore, we evaluate seven pre-trained deep learning models, including a Vision Transformer, under identical training conditions, using focal loss and patient-wise splits to prevent data leakage. Experimental results suggest that all models achieved high classification accuracy (96--98\\%), with ResNet-18 and EfficientNet-B0 showing the best overall performance and MobileNet-V3 providing an efficient lightweight alternative. Grad-CAM heatmap visualizations confirm that the proposed methods focus on clinically relevant lung regions, supporting the use of explainable AI for radiological diagnostics. Overall, this work highlights the potential of weakly supervised, explainable models that enhance transparency and clinical trust in AI-assisted pneumonia screening.",

This paper argues that large artificial intelligence models (LAMs) can endow base stations with perception, reasoning, and acting capabilities, thus transforming them into intelligent base station agents (IBSAs). We first review the historical evolution of BSs from single-functional analog infrastructure to distributed, software-defined, and finally LAM-empowered IBSA, highlighting the accompanying changes in architecture, hardware platforms, and deployment. We then present an IBSA architecture that couples a perception-cognition-execution pipeline with cloud-edge-end collaboration and parameter-efficient adaptation. Subsequently,we study two representative scenarios: (i) cooperative vehicle-road perception for autonomous driving, and (ii) ubiquitous base station support for low-altitude uncrewed aerial vehicle safety monitoring and response against unauthorized drones. On this basis, we analyze key enabling technologies spanning LAM design and training, efficient edge-cloud inference, multi-modal perception and actuation, as well as trustworthy security and governance. We further propose a holistic evaluation framework and benchmark considerations that jointly cover communication performance, perception accuracy, decision-making reliability, safety, and energy efficiency. Finally, we distill open challenges on benchmarks, continual adaptation, trustworthy decision-making, and standardization. Together, this work positions LAM-enabled IBSAs as a practical path toward integrated perception, communication, and computation native, safety-critical 6G systems.",

In this context, systems must assess how well their decisions reflect human values. To achieve this, it is essential to identify whether each available action promotes or undermines these values. This article presents Value Lens, a text-based model designed to detect human values using generative artificial intelligence, specifically Large Language Models (LLMs). The proposed model operates in two stages: the first aims to formulate a formal theory of values, while the second focuses on identifying these values within a given text. In the first stage, an LLM generates a description based on the established theory of values, which experts then verify. In the second stage, a pair of LLMs is employed: one LLM detects the presence of values, and the second acts as a critic and reviewer of the detection process. The results indicate that Value Lens performs comparably to, and even exceeds, the effectiveness of other models that apply different methods for similar tasks.",

        "abstract": "Surface electromyography (EMG) is a non-invasive sensing modality used in several domains, including biomechanics, rehabilitation, prosthetic control, and emerging human-machine interaction paradigms. Despite decades of use, significant challenges remain in achieving robust generalization across subjects, recording systems, and acquisition protocols. To tackle these challenges, foundation models (FMs) are gaining traction when targeting end-to-end applications based on EMG signals. Yet, existing EMG FMs remain limited to single downstream tasks and lack deployability on embedded platforms. In this work, we present TinyMyo, a lightweight FM based on a Transformer encoder architecture. The model is pre-trained in a self-supervised manner on publicly available datasets and achieves high reconstruction fidelity with only 3.6M parameters. With minimal task-specific head adaptations, the same backbone is used to tackle multiple downstream tasks, leveraging datasets acquired from diverse sensing locations and hardware platforms. We demonstrate generalization across hand gesture classification, hand kinematic regression, speech production and recognition, with performance comparable to or surpassing the state of the art (SoA), and model size below 5M parameters. We achieve SoA results compared to previous FM-based works on the NinaPro DB5 ($89.4\\pm0.16\\%$), UCI-EMG ($97.56\\pm0.32\\%$), and EPN-612 ($96.74\\pm0.09\\%$) datasets. We report, to the best of our knowledge, the first deployment of an EMG FM on an ultra-low-power microcontroller (GAP9), achieving an average power envelope of 36.45mW. By open-sourcing the pre-trained and the downstream task architectures (this https URL), we aim to provide a flexible resource that can accelerate future research and serve as a common foundation for the EMG community.",

The ESO is utilized to estimate the system states and the lumped disturbance in real time, forming the foundation for effective disturbance compensation. To obtain near-optimal behavior without an accurate system description, a value-iteration-based Adaptive Dynamic Programming (ADP) method is adopted for policy approximation. The inclusion of the ETM ensures that parameter updates of the learning module are executed only when the state deviation surpasses a predefined bound, thereby preventing excessive learning activity and substantially reducing computational load. A Lyapunov-oriented analysis is used to characterize the stability properties of the resulting closed-loop system. Numerical experiments further confirm that the developed approach maintains strong control performance and disturbance tolerance, while achieving a significant reduction in sampling and processing effort compared with standard time-triggered ADP schemes.",

Formal tests of unconditional (Kupiec) and conditional (Christoffersen) coverage reveal that an LSTM baseline achieves near-nominal calibration. In contrast, a GARCH(1,1) model with Student-t innovations underestimates tail risk. Our proposed discount-factor DLM model produces a slightly liberal VaR estimate, with evidence of clustered violations. Bayesian logistic regression improves recall and AUC-ROC for fraud detection, and a hierarchical Beta state-space model provides transparent and adaptive compliance risk assessment. The pipeline is distinguished by precise uncertainty quantification, interpretability, and GPU-accelerated analysis, delivering up to 50x speedup. Remaining challenges include sparse fraud data and proxy compliance labels, but the framework enables actionable risk insights.

However, the scalability of automating their generation is severely constrained by the high cost and latency of execution-based evaluation.

To address this limitation, we propose GLOW, a unified framework for AW performance prediction that combines the graph-structure modeling capabilities of GNNs with the reasoning power of LLMs. Specifically, we introduce a graph-oriented LLM, instruction-tuned on graph tasks, to extract topologically aware semantic features, which are fused with GNN-encoded structural representations. A contrastive alignment strategy further refines the latent space to distinguish high-quality AWs. Extensive experiments on FLORA-Bench show that GLOW outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in prediction accuracy and ranking utility.",

        "abstract": "Encrypted traffic classification aims to identify applications or services by analyzing network traffic data. One of the critical challenges is the continuous emergence of new applications, which generates Out-of-Distribution (OOD) traffic patterns that deviate from known categories and are not well represented by predefined models. Current approaches rely on predefined categories, which limits their effectiveness in handling unknown traffic types. Although some methods mitigate this limitation by simply classifying unknown traffic into a single \"Other\" category, they fail to make a fine-grained classification. In this paper, we propose a Two-stage Adaptive OOD classification Network (TAO-Net) that achieves accurate classification for both In-Distribution (ID) and OOD encrypted traffic. The method incorporates an innovative two-stage design: the first stage employs a hybrid OOD detection mechanism that integrates transformer-based inter-layer transformation smoothness and feature analysis to effectively distinguish between ID and OOD traffic, while the second stage leverages large language models with a novel semantic-enhanced prompt strategy to transform OOD traffic classification into a generation task, enabling flexible fine-grained classification without relying on predefined labels. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate that TAO-Net achieves 96.81-97.70% macro-precision and 96.77-97.68% macro-F1, outperforming previous methods that only reach 44.73-86.30% macro-precision, particularly in identifying emerging network applications.",

Traditional deterministic, metaheuristic, and machine-learning-assisted methods search within fixed, human-defined configuration spaces, limiting their ability to discover fundamentally new design topologies. Here we introduce ReactorFold, a generative framework that reformulates fuel-assembly design as a sequence modeling problem for language models. Using Monte Carlo data, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), the model learns the latent structure of a pressurized-water-reactor assembly and generates candidate layouts in a single forward pass. Notably, the DPO-aligned model exhibits emergent design-space expansion: despite being trained exclusively on configurations with a fixed number of gadolinium burnable absorber (Gd) rods, it autonomously adjusts Gd inventory to satisfy strict power-peaking constraints. The model also discovers high-performing asymmetric configurations that challenge conventional symmetric loading heuristics, accessing design regimes inaccessible to conventional search methods and demonstrating that language models can internalize causal physical relationships and transcend human-imposed design constraints.",

While test-time adaptation (TTA) offers a promising approach for personalized prediction, the rarity of IOH events often leads to unreliable test-time training. To address this, we propose CSA-TTA, a novel Cross-Sample Augmented Test-Time Adaptation framework that enhances training by incorporating hypotension events from other individuals. Specifically, we first construct a cross-sample bank by segmenting historical data into hypotensive and non-hypotensive samples. Then, we introduce a coarse-to-fine retrieval strategy for building test-time training data: we initially apply K-Shape clustering to identify representative cluster centers and subsequently retrieve the top-K semantically similar samples based on the current patient signal. Additionally, we integrate both self-supervised masked reconstruction and retrospective sequence forecasting signals during training to enhance model adaptability to rapid and subtle intraoperative dynamics. We evaluate the proposed CSA-TTA on both the VitalDB dataset and a real-world in-hospital dataset by integrating it with state-of-the-art time series forecasting models, including TimesFM and UniTS. CSA-TTA consistently enhances performance across settings-for instance, on VitalDB, it improves Recall and F1 scores by +1.33% and +1.13%, respectively, under fine-tuning, and by +7.46% and +5.07% in zero-shot scenarios-demonstrating strong robustness and generalization.",

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) can perform many NLP tasks well, but fully fine-tuning them is expensive and requires a lot of memory. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods such as LoRA reduce this cost by adding small low-rank updates to frozen model weights. However, these methods restrict the training to a limited subspace, which can sometimes reduce performance. For Small Language Models (SLMs), where efficiency gains matter even more, we introduce AdaGradSelect, an adaptive method that selects which transformer blocks to update based on gradients. Early observations showed that updating only the transformer blocks with the highest gradient norms can achieve performance close to full fine-tuning. Building on this insight, AdaGradSelect adaptively chooses which blocks to train. It uses a combination of Dirichlet-based sampling, which depends on how frequently blocks were updated in the past, and an epsilon-greedy exploration strategy. This lets the method explore different blocks in early training and gradually focus on the most important ones in later epochs. Experiments show that AdaGradSelect trains about 12 percent faster and uses 35 percent less GPU memory while delivering performance very close to full fine-tuning. On the GSM8K dataset, it outperforms LoRA (rank 256) by about 3 percent on average across models such as Qwen2.5-0.5B, LLaMA3.2-1B, and Phi4-mini-3.8B. It also achieves similar accuracy on the MATH dataset. Overall, AdaGradSelect provides a more effective and resource-efficient alternative to traditional fine-tuning methods.",

        "abstract": "Loop transformations are semantics-preserving optimization techniques, widely used to maximize objectives such as parallelism. Despite decades of research, applying the optimal composition of loop transformations remains challenging due to inherent complexities, including cost modeling for optimization objectives. Recent studies have explored the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) for code optimization. However, our key observation is that LLMs often struggle with effective loop transformation optimization, frequently leading to errors or suboptimal optimization, thereby missing opportunities for performance improvements. To bridge this gap, we propose LOOPRAG, a novel retrieval-augmented generation framework designed to guide LLMs in performing effective loop optimization on Static Control Part. We introduce a parameter-driven method to harness loop properties, which trigger various loop transformations, and generate diverse yet legal example codes serving as a demonstration source. To effectively obtain the most informative demonstrations, we propose a loop-aware algorithm based on loop features, which balances similarity and diversity for code retrieval. To enhance correct and efficient code generation, we introduce a feedback-based iterative mechanism that incorporates compilation, testing and performance results as feedback to guide LLMs. Each optimized code undergoes mutation, coverage and differential testing for equivalence checking. We evaluate LOOPRAG on PolyBench, TSVC and LORE benchmark suites, and compare it against compilers (GCC-Graphite, Clang-Polly, Perspective and ICX) and representative LLMs (DeepSeek and GPT-4). The results demonstrate average speedups over base compilers of up to 11.20$\\times$, 14.34$\\times$, and 9.29$\\times$ for PolyBench, TSVC, and LORE, respectively, and speedups over base LLMs of up to 11.97$\\times$, 5.61$\\times$, and 11.59$\\times$.",

        "abstract": "Simulating complex unsteady physical phenomena relies on detailed mathematical models, simulated for instance by using the Finite Element Method (FEM). However, these models often exhibit discrepancies from the reality due to unmodeled effects or simplifying assumptions. We refer to this gap as the ignorance model. While purely data-driven approaches attempt to learn full system behavior, they require large amounts of high-quality data across the entire spatial and temporal domain. In real-world scenarios, such information is unavailable, making full data-driven modeling unreliable. To overcome this limitation, we model of the ignorance component using a hybrid twin approach, instead of simulating phenomena from scratch. Since physics-based models approximate the overall behavior of the phenomena, the remaining ignorance is typically lower in complexity than the full physical response, therefore, it can be learned with significantly fewer data. A key difficulty, however, is that spatial measurements are sparse, also obtaining data measuring the same phenomenon for different spatial configurations is challenging in practice. Our contribution is to overcome this limitation by using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to represent the ignorance model. GNNs learn the spatial pattern of the missing physics even when the number of measurement locations is limited. This allows us to enrich the physics-based model with data-driven corrections without requiring dense spatial, temporal and parametric data. To showcase the performance of the proposed method, we evaluate this GNN-based hybrid twin on nonlinear heat transfer problems across different meshes, geometries, and load positions. Results show that the GNN successfully captures the ignorance and generalizes corrections across spatial configurations, improving simulation accuracy and interpretability, while minimizing data requirements.",

However, this new data source paradigm may introduce important security concerns. This work investigates backdoor propagation in such emerging generative data supply chains, namely Data-Chain Backdoor (DCB). Specifically, we find that open-source diffusion models can become hidden carriers of backdoors. Their strong distribution-fitting ability causes them to memorize and reproduce backdoor triggers during generation, which are subsequently inherited by downstream models, resulting in severe security risks. This threat is particularly concerning under clean-label attack scenarios, as it remains effective while having negligible impact on the utility of the synthetic data. Furthermore, we discover an Early-Stage Trigger Manifestation (ESTM) phenomenon: backdoor trigger patterns tend to surface more explicitly in the early, high-noise stages of the diffusion model's reverse generation process before being subtly integrated into the final samples. Overall, this work reveals a previously underexplored threat in generative data pipelines and provides initial insights toward mitigating backdoor risks in synthetic data generation.",

The temporal complexity of embodied tasks demands a dynamic and adaptable computation mode. Static and lossy acceleration methods, such as quantization, fail to handle such dynamic embodied tasks, while speculative decoding offers a lossless and adaptive yet underexplored alternative for DP. However, it is non-trivial to address the following challenges: how to match the base model's denoising quality at lower cost under time-varying task difficulty in embodied settings, and how to dynamically and interactively adjust computation based on task difficulty in such environments. In this paper, we propose Temporal-aware Reinforcement-based Speculative Diffusion Policy (TS-DP), the first framework that enables speculative decoding for DP with temporal adaptivity. First, to handle dynamic environments where task difficulty varies over time, we distill a Transformer-based drafter to imitate the base model and replace its costly denoising calls. Second, an RL-based scheduler further adapts to time-varying task difficulty by adjusting speculative parameters to maintain accuracy while improving efficiency. Extensive experiments across diverse embodied environments demonstrate that TS-DP achieves up to 4.17 times faster inference with over 94% accepted drafts, reaching an inference frequency of 25 Hz and enabling real-time diffusion-based control without performance degradation.",

        "abstract": "Cultural rights and the right to development are essential norms within the wider framework of international human rights law. However, recent technological advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and adjacent digital frontier technologies pose significant challenges to the protection and realization of these rights. This owes to the increasing influence of AI systems on the creation and depiction of cultural content, affect the use and distribution of the intellectual property of individuals and communities, and influence cultural participation and expression worldwide. In addition, the growing influence of AI thus risks exacerbating preexisting economic, social and digital divides and reinforcing inequities for marginalized communities. This dynamic challenges the existing interplay between cultural rights and the right to development, and raises questions about the integration of cultural and developmental considerations into emerging AI governance frameworks. To address these challenges, the paper examines the impact of AI on both categories of rights. Conceptually, it analyzes the epistemic and normative limitations of AI with respect to cultural and developmental assumptions embedded in algorithmic design and deployment, but also individual and structural impacts of AI on both rights. On this basis, the paper identifies gaps and tensions in existing AI governance frameworks with respect to cultural rights and the right to development. By situating cultural rights and the right to development within the broader landscape of AI and human rights, this paper contributes to the academic discourse on AI ethics, legal frameworks, and international human rights law. Finally, it outlines avenues for future research and policy development based on existing conversations in global AI governance.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, advances in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly generative AI (GenAI) and large language models (LLMs), have made human-computer interactions more frequent, efficient, and accessible across sectors ranging from banking to healthcare. AI tools embedded in digital devices support decision-making and operational management at both individual and organizational levels, including resource allocation, workflow automation, and real-time data analysis. However, the prevailing cloud-centric deployment of AI carries a substantial environmental footprint due to high computational demands. In this context, this paper introduces the concept of agentic environments, a sustainability-oriented AI framework that extends beyond reactive systems by leveraging GenAI, multi-agent systems, and edge computing to reduce the environmental impact of technology. Agentic environments enable more efficient resource use, improved quality of life, and sustainability-by-design, while simultaneously enhancing data privacy through decentralized, edge-driven solutions. Drawing on secondary research as well as primary data from focus groups and semi-structured interviews with AI professionals from leading technology companies, the paper proposes a conceptual framework for agentic environments examined through three lenses: the personal sphere, professional and commercial use, and urban operations. The findings highlight the potential of agentic environments to foster sustainable ecosystems through optimized resource utilization and strengthened data privacy. The study concludes with recommendations for edge-driven deployment models to reduce reliance on energy-intensive cloud infrastructures.",

        "abstract": "In Artificial Intelligence (AI), language models have gained significant importance due to the widespread adoption of systems capable of simulating realistic conversations with humans through text generation. Because of their impact on society, developing and deploying these language models must be done responsibly, with attention to their negative impacts and possible harms. In this scenario, the number of AI Ethics Tools (AIETs) publications has recently increased. These AIETs are designed to help developers, companies, governments, and other stakeholders establish trust, transparency, and responsibility with their technologies by bringing accepted values to guide AI's design, development, and use stages. However, many AIETs lack good documentation, examples of use, and proof of their effectiveness in practice. This paper presents a methodology for evaluating AIETs in language models. Our approach involved an extensive literature survey on 213 AIETs, and after applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, we selected four AIETs: Model Cards, ALTAI, FactSheets, and Harms Modeling. For evaluation, we applied AIETs to language models developed for the Portuguese language, conducting 35 hours of interviews with their developers. The evaluation considered the developers' perspective on the AIETs' use and quality in helping to identify ethical considerations about their model. The results suggest that the applied AIETs serve as a guide for formulating general ethical considerations about language models. However, we note that they do not address unique aspects of these models, such as idiomatic expressions. Additionally, these AIETs did not help to identify potential negative impacts of models for the Portuguese language.",

        "abstract": "Human behaviors are often guided or constrained by social norms, which are defined as shared, commonsense rules. For example, underlying an action ``\\textit{report a witnessed crime}\" are social norms that inform our conduct, such as ``\\textit{It is expected to be brave to report crimes}''. Current AI systems that assess valence (i.e., support or oppose) of human actions by leveraging large-scale data training not grounded on explicit norms may be difficult to explain, and thus untrustworthy. Emulating human assessors by considering social norms can help AI models better understand and predict valence. While multiple norms come into play, conflicting norms can create tension and directly influence human behavior. For example, when deciding whether to ``\\textit{report a witnessed crime}'', one may balance \\textit{bravery} against \\textit{self-protection}. In this paper, we introduce \\textit{ClarityEthic}, a novel ethical assessment approach, to enhance valence prediction and explanation by generating conflicting social norms behind human actions, which strengthens the moral reasoning capabilities of language models by using a contrastive learning strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms strong baseline approaches, and human evaluations confirm that the generated social norms provide plausible explanations for the assessment of human behaviors.",

While algorithmic efficiency enhances evidence extraction, a research gap exists regarding the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023's compatibility with adversarial AI threats, specifically anti-forensics and deepfakes. This study scrutinizes the AI \"dual-use\" dilemma, functioning as both a cyber-threat vector and forensic automation mechanism, to delineate privacy boundaries in high-stakes investigations. Employing a doctrinal legal methodology, the research synthesizes statutory analysis of the DPDP Act with global ethical frameworks (IEEE, EU) to evaluate regulatory efficacy. Preliminary results indicate that while Machine Learning offers high accuracy in pattern recognition, it introduces vulnerabilities regarding data poisoning and algorithmic bias. Findings highlight a critical tension between the Act's data minimization principles and forensic data retention requirements. Furthermore, the paper identifies that existing legal definitions inadequately encompass AI-driven \"tool crimes\" and \"target crimes.\" Consequently, the research proposes a \"human-centric\" forensic model prioritizing explainable AI (XAI) to ensure evidence admissibility. These implications suggest that synchronizing Indian privacy statutes with international forensic standards is imperative to mitigate synthetic media risks, establishing a roadmap for future legislative amendments and technical standardization.",

Earlier works like CodeAct, DynaSaur, Code Mode have tried to tackle the first two issues by using the whole Python language as its action space: The number of tools that the agent can call becomes infinite. Python code blocks can execute complex actions into a single step and print only relevant results which helps in keeping the context lean. However, the probabilistic instability issue still remains, as for the same task in the same environment, the agent can follow different trajectories due to the probabilistic nature of LLMs. Therefore, we need procedural memory for consistency and reliability. This paper proposes CodeMem, an architecture to implement procedural memory via code which can be used to build and run reusable agentic workflows with deterministic reliability.",

We evaluate NeuroInv on a comprehensive benchmark of 150 Java programs, encompassing single and multiple (sequential) loops, multiple arrays, random branching, and noisy code segments. NeuroInv achieves a $99.5\\%$ success rate, substantially outperforming the other evaluated approaches. Additionally, we introduce a hard benchmark of $10$ larger multi-loop programs (with an average of $7$ loops each); NeuroInv's performance in this setting demonstrates that it can scale to more complex verification scenarios.",

LM-based agentic frameworks frequently interact with their environment via such tools to search files, run code, call APIs, etc. Further, modern reasoning-based LMs use tools such as web search and Python code execution to enhance their reasoning capabilities. While tools greatly improve the capabilities of LMs, they also introduce performance bottlenecks during the inference process. In this paper, we introduce novel systems optimizations to address such performance bottlenecks by speculating tool calls and forcing sequences to remain resident in the inference engine to minimize overheads. Our optimizations lead to throughput improvements of several hundred tokens per second when hosting inference for LM agents. We provide a theoretical analysis of our algorithms to provide insights into speculation configurations that will yield the best performance.

        "abstract": "In the last century, most sensorimotor studies of cortical neurons relied on average firing rates. Rate coding is efficient for fast sensorimotor processing that occurs within a few seconds. Much less is known about long-term working memory with a time scale of hours (Ericsson and Kintsch, 1995). The discovery of the millisecond precision of spike initiation in cortical neurons was unexpected (Mainen and Sejnowski, 1995). Even more striking was the precision of spiking in vivo, in response to rapidly fluctuating sensory inputs, suggesting that neural circuits could, in principle, preserve and manipulate sensory information through spike timing. It could support spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), which is triggered by the relative timing of spikes between presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons in the millisecond range. What spike-timing mechanisms could regulate STDP in vivo? Cortical traveling waves have been observed across many frequency bands with high temporal precision. Traveling waves have wave fronts that could link spike timing to STDP. As a wave front passes through a cortical column, excitatory synapses on the dendrites of both pyramidal and basket cells are synchronously stimulated. Inhibitory basket cells form a calyx on pyramidal cell bodies, and inhibitory rebound following a strong transient hyperpolarization can trigger a backpropagating action potential, which arrives shortly after the excitatory inputs on pyramidal dendrites. STDP activated in this way could persist for hours, creating a second-tier network. This temporary network could support long-term working memory, a cognitive network riding above the long-term sensorimotor network. On their own, traveling waves and STDP have not yet yielded new insights into cortical function. Together, they could be responsible for how we think (Sejnowski, 2025).",

Trusted for their ability to act without direct oversight, such agents are increasingly considered in high-stakes domains including financial management, dispute resolution, and governance. Yet in practice, agents execute on infrastructure controlled by a host, who can tamper with models, inputs, or outputs, undermining any meaningful notion of autonomy. We address this gap by introducing VET (Verifiable Execution Traces), a formal framework that achieves host-independent authentication of agent outputs and takes a step toward host-independent autonomy. Central to VET is the Agent Identity Document (AID), which specifies an agent's configuration together with the proof systems required for verification. VET is compositional: it supports multiple proof mechanisms, including trusted hardware, succinct cryptographic proofs, and notarized TLS transcripts (Web Proofs). We implement VET for an API-based LLM agent and evaluate our instantiation on realistic workloads. We find that for today's black-box, secret-bearing API calls, Web Proofs appear to be the most practical choice, with overhead typically under 3$\\times$ compared to direct API calls, while for public API calls, a lower-overhead TEE Proxy is often sufficient. As a case study, we deploy a verifiable trading agent that produces proofs for each decision and composes Web Proofs with a TEE Proxy. Our results demonstrate that practical, host-agnostic authentication is already possible with current technology, laying the foundation for future systems that achieve full host-independent autonomy.",

        "abstract": "Reading stories evokes rich interpretive, affective, and evaluative responses, such as inferences about narrative intent or judgments about characters. Yet, computational models of reader response are limited, preventing nuanced analyses. To address this gap, we introduce SocialStoryFrames, a formalism for distilling plausible inferences about reader response, such as perceived author intent, explanatory and predictive reasoning, affective responses, and value judgments, using conversational context and a taxonomy grounded in narrative theory, linguistic pragmatics, and psychology. We develop two models, SSF-Generator and SSF-Classifier, validated through human surveys (N=382 participants) and expert annotations, respectively. We conduct pilot analyses to showcase the utility of the formalism for studying storytelling at scale. Specifically, applying our models to SSF-Corpus, a curated dataset of 6,140 social media stories from diverse contexts, we characterize the frequency and interdependence of storytelling intents, and we compare and contrast narrative practices (and their diversity) across communities. By linking fine-grained, context-sensitive modeling with a generic taxonomy of reader responses, SocialStoryFrames enable new research into storytelling in online communities.",

While recent computational advances, such as diffusion models, can design high-affinity IDP binders, translating these to practical drug discovery requires autonomous systems capable of reasoning across complex conformational ensembles and orchestrating diverse computational tools at this http URL address this challenge, we designed and implemented StructBioReasoner, a scalable multi-agent system for designing biologics that can be used to target IDPs. StructBioReasoner employs a novel tournament-based reasoning framework where specialized agents compete to generate and refine therapeutic hypotheses, naturally distributing computational load for efficient exploration of the vast design space. Agents integrate domain knowledge with access to literature synthesis, AI-structure prediction, molecular simulations, and stability analysis, coordinating their execution on HPC infrastructure via an extensible federated agentic middleware, Academy. We benchmark StructBioReasoner across Der f 21 and NMNAT-2 and demonstrate that over 50\\% of 787 designed and validated candidates for Der f 21 outperformed the human-designed reference binders from literature, in terms of improved binding free energy. For the more challenging NMNAT-2 protein, we identified three binding modes from 97,066 binders, including the well-studied NMNAT2:p53 interface. Thus, StructBioReasoner lays the groundwork for agentic reasoning systems for IDP therapeutic discovery on Exascale platforms.",

While architectural abstractions offer a means to manage these systems, maintaining their consistency with the actual code has been problematic. The Java Platform Module System (JPMS), introduced in Java 9, addresses this limitation by enabling explicit module specification at the language level. JPMS enhances architectural implementation through improved encapsulation and direct specification of ground-truth architectures within Java projects. Although many projects are written in Java, modularizing existing monolithic projects to JPMS modules is an open challenge due to ineffective module recovery by existing architecture recovery techniques. To address this challenge, this paper presents ClassLAR (Class-and Language model-based Architectural Recovery), a novel, lightweight, and efficient approach that recovers Java modules from monolithic Java systems using fully-qualified class names. ClassLAR leverages language models to extract semantic information from package and class names, capturing both structural and functional intent. In evaluations across 20 popular Java projects, ClassLAR outperformed all state-of-the-art techniques in architectural-level similarity metrics while achieving execution times that were 3.99 to 10.50 times faster.",

        "abstract": "It is widely believed that complex machine learning models generally encode features through linear representations, but these features exist in superposition, making them challenging to recover. We study the following fundamental setting for learning features in superposition from black-box query access: we are given query access to a function \\[ f(x)=\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i\\,\\sigma_i(v_i^\\top x), \\] where each unit vector $v_i$ encodes a feature direction and $\\sigma_i:\\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ is an arbitrary response function and our goal is to recover the $v_i$ and the function $f$. In learning-theoretic terms, superposition refers to the overcomplete regime, when the number of features is larger than the underlying dimension (i.e. $n > d$), which has proven especially challenging for typical algorithmic approaches. Our main result is an efficient query algorithm that, from noisy oracle access to $f$, identifies all feature directions whose responses are non-degenerate and reconstructs the function $f$. Crucially, our algorithm works in a significantly more general setting than all related prior results -- we allow for essentially arbitrary superpositions, only requiring that $v_i, v_j$ are not nearly identical for $i \\neq j$, and general response functions $\\sigma_i$. At a high level, our algorithm introduces an approach for searching in Fourier space by iteratively refining the search space to locate the hidden directions $v_i$.",

However, both transfer learning and the exploitation of spatial variability in this field are challenging, as they involve heterogeneous data and complex cross-scale dependencies. Conventional approaches often rely on location-independent parameterizations and independent training, underutilizing transfer learning and spatial heterogeneity in the inputs, and limiting their applicability in regions with substantial variability. We propose FTBSC-KGML (Fine-Tuning-Based Site Calibration-Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning), a pretraining- and fine-tuning-based, spatial-variability-aware, and knowledge-guided machine learning framework that augments KGML-ag with a pretraining-fine-tuning process and site-specific parameters. Using a pretraining-fine-tuning process with remote-sensing GPP, climate, and soil covariates collected across multiple midwestern sites, FTBSC-KGML estimates land emissions while leveraging transfer learning and spatial heterogeneity. A key component is a spatial-heterogeneity-aware transfer-learning scheme, which is a globally pretrained model that is fine-tuned at each state or site to learn place-aware representations, thereby improving local accuracy under limited data without sacrificing interpretability. Empirically, FTBSC-KGML achieves lower validation error and greater consistency in explanatory power than a purely global model, thereby better capturing spatial variability across states.

While the traditional approach to capturing these evaluations is to conduct a user study, recent work has proposed utilizing machine learning instead. However, existing data-driven methods require large amounts of labeled data, which limits their use in practice. To address this gap, we propose leveraging the few-shot learning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve how well a robot can predict a user's perception of its performance, and study this idea experimentally in social navigation tasks. To this end, we extend the SEAN TOGETHER dataset with additional real-world human-robot navigation episodes and participant feedback. Using this augmented dataset, we evaluate the ability of several LLMs to predict human perceptions of robot performance from a small number of in-context examples, based on observed spatio-temporal cues of the robot and surrounding human motion. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can match or exceed the performance of traditional supervised learning models while requiring an order of magnitude fewer labeled instances. We further show that prediction performance can improve with more in-context examples, confirming the scalability of our approach. Additionally, we investigate what kind of sensor-based information an LLM relies on to make these inferences by conducting an ablation study on the input features considered for performance prediction. Finally, we explore the novel application of personalized examples for in-context learning, i.e., drawn from the same user being evaluated, finding that they further enhance prediction accuracy.

By translating the prompts and word list into five target languages, English, Chinese, Arabic, French, and Spanish, we directly compare different types of bias across languages. The results reveal substantial gaps in bias across languages used in LLMs. For example, Arabic and Spanish consistently show higher levels of stereotype bias, while Chinese and English exhibit lower levels of bias. We also identify contrasting patterns across bias types. Age shows the lowest explicit bias but the highest implicit bias, emphasizing the importance of detecting implicit biases that are undetectable with standard benchmarks. These findings indicate that LLMs vary significantly across languages and bias dimensions. This study fills a key research gap by providing a comprehensive methodology for cross-lingual bias analysis.

However, existing benchmarks for LLM-as-a-Judge are mainly relying on human-annotated ground truth, which introduces human bias that undermines the assessment of reliability and imposes scalability constraints. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Sage, a novel evaluation suite that assesses the quality of LLM judges without necessitating any human annotation. Inspired by axioms of rational choice theory, Sage introduces two new lenses for measuring LLM-as-a-Judge: local self-consistency (pair-wise preference stability) and global logical consistency (transitivity across a full set of preferences). We curate a dataset of 650 questions by combining structured benchmark problems with real-world user queries. Our experiments demonstrate both the stability of our metrics and their high correlation with supervised benchmarks like LLMBar and RewardBench2, confirming Sage's reliability as an evaluation suite for the robustness and accuracy of LLM-as-a-Judge. Based on Sage, we reveal that current state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit significant reliability problems when acting as judges in both scoring and pairwise settings; even the top-performing models, Gemini-2.5-Pro and GPT-5, fail to maintain consistent preferences in nearly a quarter of difficult cases. We attribute this to a new phenomenon called situational preference, which explains why explicit rubrics or criteria can help the model judge consistently across answer pairs. Our further analysis shows that finetuned LLM-as-a-Judge is a feasible method to boost performance, and the panel-based judge as well as deep reasoning can enhance the judging consistency. We also find substantial inconsistency in human judgments, which indicates that human annotation may not be a reliable gold standard.",

        "abstract": "Streamflow forecasting is crucial for water resource management and risk mitigation. While deep learning models have achieved strong predictive performance, they often overlook underlying physical processes, limiting interpretability and generalization. Recent causal learning approaches address these issues by integrating domain knowledge, yet they typically rely on fixed causal graphs that fail to adapt to data. We propose CauStream, a unified framework for causal spatiotemporal streamflow forecasting. CauSTream jointly learns (i) a runoff causal graph among meteorological forcings and (ii) a routing graph capturing dynamic dependencies across stations. We further establish identifiability conditions for these causal structures under a nonparametric setting. We evaluate CauSTream on three major U.S. river basins across three forecasting horizons. The model consistently outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods, with performance gaps widening at longer forecast windows, indicating stronger generalization to unseen conditions. Beyond forecasting, CauSTream also learns causal graphs that capture relationships among hydrological factors and stations. The inferred structures align closely with established domain knowledge, offering interpretable insights into watershed dynamics. CauSTream offers a principled foundation for causal spatiotemporal modeling, with the potential to extend to a wide range of scientific and environmental applications.",

In this study, we developed a multi agent large language model framework that automates qualitative thematic analysis through three agents (Instructor, Thematizer, CodebookGenerator), named Collaborative Theme Identification Agent (CoTI). We applied CoTI to 12 heart failure patient interviews to analyze their perceptions of medication intensity. CoTI identified key phrases, themes, and codebook that were more similar to those of the senior investigator than both junior investigators and baseline NLP models.

However, most existing technologies for measuring Pb are labor-intensive and costly. In this study, we propose SoilScanner, a radio frequency-based wireless system that can detect Pb in soils. This is based on our discovery that the propagation of different frequency band radio signals is affected differently by different salts such as NaCl and Pb(NO3)2 in the soil. In a controlled experiment, manually adding NaCl and Pb(NO3)2 in clean soil, we demonstrated that different salts reflected signals at different frequencies in distinct patterns. In addition, we confirmed the finding using uncontrolled field samples with a machine learning model. Our experiment results show that SoilScanner can classify soil samples into low-Pb and high-Pb categories (threshold at 200 ppm) with an accuracy of 72%, with no sample with > 500 ppm of Pb being misclassified. The results of this study show that it is feasible to build portable and affordable Pb detection and screening devices based on wireless technology.",

Generative models have demonstrated promising results in creating full-body nonverbal animations synchronized with speech; however, evaluations using statistical metrics in 2D settings fail to fully capture user-perceived emotions, limiting our understanding of model effectiveness. To address this, we evaluate emotional 3D animation generative models within a Virtual Reality (VR) environment, emphasizing user-centric metrics emotional arousal realism, naturalness, enjoyment, diversity, and interaction quality in a real-time human-agent interaction scenario. Through a user study (N=48), we examine perceived emotional quality for three state of the art speech-driven 3D animation methods across two emotions happiness (high arousal) and neutral (mid arousal). Additionally, we compare these generative models against real human expressions obtained via a reconstruction-based method to assess both their strengths and limitations and how closely they replicate real human facial and body expressions. Our results demonstrate that methods explicitly modeling emotions lead to higher recognition accuracy compared to those focusing solely on speech-driven synchrony. Users rated the realism and naturalness of happy animations significantly higher than those of neutral animations, highlighting the limitations of current generative models in handling subtle emotional states. Generative models underperformed compared to reconstruction-based methods in facial expression quality, and all methods received relatively low ratings for animation enjoyment and interaction quality, emphasizing the importance of incorporating user-centric evaluations into generative model development. Finally, participants positively recognized animation diversity across all generative models.",

While effective on small databases, this approach fails on real-world schemas that exceed LLM context limits, even for commercial models. The recent Spider 2.0 benchmark exemplifies this with hundreds of tables and tens of thousands of columns, where existing systems often break. Current mitigations either rely on costly multi-step prompting pipelines or filter columns by ranking them against user's question independently, ignoring inter-column structure. To scale existing systems, we introduce \\toolname, an open-source, LLM-efficient schema filtering framework that compacts Text2SQL prompts by (i) ranking columns with a query-aware LLM encoder enriched with values and metadata, (ii) reranking inter-connected columns via a lightweight graph transformer over functional dependencies, and (iii) selecting a connectivity-preserving sub-schema with a Steiner-tree heuristic. Experiments on real datasets show that \\toolname achieves near-perfect recall and higher precision than CodeS, SchemaExP, Qwen rerankers, and embedding retrievers, while maintaining sub-second median latency and scaling to schemas with 23,000+ columns.

Retail investors, regulators, and brokerages need tools that connect online narratives and coordination patterns to market behavior. We present AIMM, an AI-driven framework that fuses Reddit activity, bot and coordination indicators, and OHLCV market features into a daily AIMM Manipulation Risk Score for each ticker. The system uses a parquet-native pipeline with a Streamlit dashboard that allows analysts to explore suspicious windows, inspect underlying posts and price action, and log model outputs over time. Due to Reddit API restrictions, we employ calibrated synthetic social features matching documented event characteristics; market data (OHLCV) uses real historical data from Yahoo Finance. This release makes three contributions. First, we build the AIMM Ground Truth dataset (AIMM-GT): 33 labeled ticker-days spanning eight equities, drawing from SEC enforcement actions, community-verified manipulation cases, and matched normal controls. Second, we implement forward-walk evaluation and prospective prediction logging for both retrospective and deployment-style assessment. Third, we analyze lead times and show that AIMM flagged GME 22 days before the January 2021 squeeze peak. The current labeled set is small (33 ticker-days, 3 positive events), but results show preliminary discriminative capability and early warnings for the GME incident. We release the code, dataset schema, and dashboard design to support research on social media-driven market surveillance.",

The corpus is built from Hugging Face model cards, GitHub READMEs, and referenced papers, linking each table to its surrounding model and publication context. Compared with open data lake tables, model tables are smaller yet exhibit denser inter table relationships, reflecting tightly coupled model and benchmark evolution. The current release covers over 60K models and 90K tables. To evaluate model and table relatedness, we construct a multi source ground truth using three complementary signals: (1) paper citation links, (2) explicit model card links and inheritance, and (3) shared training datasets. We present one extensive empirical use case for the benchmark which is table search. We compare canonical Data Lake search operators (unionable, joinable, keyword) and Information Retrieval baselines (dense, sparse, hybrid retrieval) on this benchmark. Union based semantic table retrieval attains 54.8 % P@1 overall (54.6 % on citation, 31.3 % on inheritance, 30.6 % on shared dataset signals); table based dense retrieval reaches 66.5 % P@1, and metadata hybrid retrieval achieves 54.1 %. This evaluation indicates clear room for developing better table search methods. By releasing ModelTables and its creation protocol, we provide the first large scale benchmark of structured data describing AI model. Our use case of table discovery in Model Lakes, provides intuition and evidence for developing more accurate semantic retrieval, structured comparison, and principled organization of structured model knowledge.

However, existing methods often generate text that mimics the linguistic style of radiologists but fails to guarantee clinical correctness, because they are trained on token-level objectives which focus on word-choice and sentence structure rather than actual medical accuracy. We propose a semantic-driven reinforcement learning (SRL) method for medical report generation, adopted on a large vision-language model (LVLM). SRL adopts Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to encourage clinical-correctness-guided learning beyond imitation of language style. Specifically, we optimise a report-level reward: a margin-based cosine similarity (MCCS) computed between key radiological findings extracted from generated and reference reports, thereby directly aligning clinical-label agreement and improving semantic correctness. A lightweight reasoning format constraint further guides the model to generate structured \"thinking report\" outputs. We evaluate Medical Report Generation with Sematic-driven Reinforment Learning (MRG-R1), on two datasets: IU X-Ray and MIMIC-CXR using clinical efficacy (CE) metrics. MRG-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance with CE-F1 51.88 on IU X-Ray and 40.39 on MIMIC-CXR. We found that the label-semantic reinforcement is better than conventional token-level supervision. These results indicate that optimizing a clinically grounded, report-level reward rather than token overlap,meaningfully improves clinical correctness. This work is a prior to explore semantic-reinforcement in supervising medical correctness in medical Large vision-language model(Med-LVLM) training.",

The Faux-Hate shared task focuses on detecting a specific phenomenon: the generation of hate speech driven by fake narratives, termed Faux-Hate. Participants are challenged to identify such instances in code-mixed Hindi-English social media text. This paper describes our system developed for the shared task, addressing two primary sub-tasks: (a) Binary Faux-Hate detection, involving fake and hate speech classification, and (b) Target and Severity prediction, categorizing the intended target and severity of hateful content. Our approach combines advanced natural language processing techniques with domain-specific pretraining to enhance performance across both tasks. The system achieved competitive results, demonstrating the efficacy of leveraging multi-task learning for this complex problem.",

        "abstract": "The rapid evolution of the Web toward an agent-centric paradigm, driven by large language models (LLMs), has enabled autonomous agents to reason, plan, and interact in complex decentralized environments. However, the openness and heterogeneity of LLM-based multi-agent systems also amplify the risks of deception, fraud, and misinformation, posing severe challenges to trust establishment and system robustness. To address this issue, we propose Ev-Trust, a strategy-equilibrium trust mechanism grounded in evolutionary game theory. This mechanism integrates direct trust, indirect trust, and expected revenue into a dynamic feedback structure that guides agents' behavioral evolution toward equilibria. Within a decentralized \"Request-Response-Payment-Evaluation\" service framework, Ev-Trust enables agents to adaptively adjust strategies, naturally excluding malicious participants while reinforcing high-quality collaboration. Furthermore, our theoretical derivation based on replicator dynamics equations proves the existence and stability of local evolutionary equilibria. Experimental results indicate that our approach effectively reflects agent trustworthiness in LLM-driven open service interaction scenarios, reduces malicious strategies, and increases collective revenue. We hope Ev-Trust can provide a new perspective on trust modeling for the agentic service web in group evolutionary game scenarios.",

Building on the insight that ad-hoc and common categories rely on similar perceptual mechanisms, we propose OAK, a simple model that introduces a small set of learnable context tokens at the input of a frozen CLIP and optimizes with both CLIP's image-text alignment objective and GCD's visual clustering objective. On Stanford and Clevr-4 datasets, OAK achieves state-of-the-art in accuracy and concept discovery across multiple categorizations, including 87.4% novel accuracy on Stanford Mood, surpassing CLIP and GCD by over 50%.

        "abstract": "Predicting geohazard runout is critical for protecting lives, infrastructure and ecosystems. Rapid mass flows, including landslides and avalanches, cause several thousand deaths across a wide range of environments, often travelling many kilometres from their source. The wide range of source conditions and material properties governing these flows makes their runout difficult to anticipate, particularly for downstream communities that may be suddenly exposed to severe impacts. Accurately predicting runout at scale requires models that are both physically realistic and computationally efficient, yet existing approaches face a fundamental speed-realism trade-off. Here we train a machine learning model to predict geohazard runout across representative real world terrains. The model predicts both flow extent and deposit thickness with high accuracy and 100 to 10,000 times faster computation than numerical solvers. It is trained on over 100,000 numerical simulations across over 10,000 real world digital elevation model chips and reproduces key physical behaviours, including avulsion and deposition patterns, while generalizing across different flow types, sizes and landscapes. Our results demonstrate that neural emulation enables rapid, spatially resolved runout prediction across diverse real world terrains, opening new opportunities for disaster risk reduction and impact-based forecasting. These results highlight neural emulation as a promising pathway for extending physically realistic geohazard modelling to spatial and temporal scales relevant for large scale early warning systems.",

However, errors or outdated information within these models can undermine their accuracy and restrict their safe deployment. Developing efficient strategies for updating model knowledge without the expense and disruption of full retraining remains a critical challenge. Current model editing techniques frequently struggle to generalize corrections beyond narrow domains, leading to unintended consequences and limiting their practical impact. Here, we introduce a novel framework for editing LLMs, grounded in information bottleneck theory. This approach precisely compresses and isolates the essential information required for generalizable knowledge correction while minimizing disruption to unrelated model behaviors. Building upon this foundation, we present the Information Bottleneck Knowledge Editor (IBKE), which leverages compact latent representations to guide gradient-based updates, enabling robust and broadly applicable model editing. We validate IBKE's effectiveness across multiple LLM architectures and standard benchmark tasks, demonstrating state-of-the-art accuracy and improved generality and specificity of edits. These findings establish a theoretically principled and practical paradigm for open-domain knowledge editing, advancing the utility and trustworthiness of LLMs in real-world applications.",

        "abstract": "Developing open-set classification methods capable of classifying in-distribution (ID) data while detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is essential for deploying graph neural networks (GNNs) in open-world scenarios. Existing methods typically treat all OOD samples as a single class, despite real-world applications, especially high-stake settings such as fraud detection and medical diagnosis, demanding deeper insights into OOD samples, including their probable labels. This raises a critical question: can OOD detection be extended to OOD classification without true label information? To address this question, we propose a Coarse-to-Fine open-set Classification (CFC) framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) for graph datasets. CFC consists of three key components: a coarse classifier that uses LLM prompts for OOD detection and outlier label generation, a GNN-based fine classifier trained with OOD samples identified by the coarse classifier for enhanced OOD detection and ID classification, and refined OOD classification achieved through LLM prompts and post-processed OOD labels. Unlike methods that rely on synthetic or auxiliary OOD samples, CFC employs semantic OOD instances that are genuinely out-of-distribution based on their inherent meaning, improving interpretability and practical utility. Experimental results show that CFC improves OOD detection by ten percent over state-of-the-art methods on graph and text domains and achieves up to seventy percent accuracy in OOD classification on graph datasets.",

In this work, we present Sigma-MoE-Tiny, an MoE language model that achieves the highest sparsity compared to existing open-source models. Sigma-MoE-Tiny employs fine-grained expert segmentation with up to 96 experts per layer, while activating only one expert for each token, resulting in 20B total parameters with just 0.5B activated. The major challenge introduced by such extreme sparsity lies in expert load balancing. We find that the widely-used load balancing loss tends to become ineffective in the lower layers under this setting. To address this issue, we propose a progressive sparsification schedule aiming to balance expert utilization and training stability. Sigma-MoE-Tiny is pre-trained on a diverse and high-quality corpus, followed by post-training to further unlock its capabilities. The entire training process remains remarkably stable, with no occurrence of irrecoverable loss spikes. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that, despite activating only 0.5B parameters, Sigma-MoE-Tiny achieves top-tier performance among counterparts of comparable or significantly larger scale. In addition, we provide an in-depth discussion of load balancing in highly sparse MoE models, offering insights for advancing sparsity in future MoE architectures.

By modeling this ``bottleneck'' to summarize firm- and macro-level information, CB-APM not only predicts future risk premiums of U.S. equities but also links belief aggregation to expected returns in a structurally interpretable manner. The model improves long-horizon return forecasts and outperforms standard deep learning approaches in both predictive accuracy and explanatory power. Comprehensive portfolio analyses show that CB-APM's out-of-sample predictions translate into economically meaningful payoffs, with monotonic return differentials and stable long-short performance across regularization settings. Empirically, CB-APM leverages consensus as a regularizer to amplify long-horizon predictability and yields interpretable consensus-based components that clarify how information is priced in returns. Moreover, regression and GRS-based pricing diagnostics reveal that the learned consensus representations capture priced variation only partially spanned by traditional factor models, demonstrating that CB-APM uncovers belief-driven structure in expected returns beyond the canonical factor space. Overall, CB-APM provides an interpretable and empirically grounded framework for understanding belief-driven return dynamics.",

However, many existing deep learning methods rely on correlation-driven acoustic representations, which makes them vulnerable to noise, spurious cues, and domain shifts across recording environments. We propose DACH-TIC, a Domain-Agnostic Causal-Aware Hierarchical Audio Transformer for robust infant cry classification. The model integrates causal attention, hierarchical representation learning, multi-task supervision, and adversarial domain generalization within a unified framework. DACH-TIC employs a structured transformer backbone with local token-level and global semantic encoders, augmented by causal attention masking and controlled perturbation training to approximate counterfactual acoustic variations. A domain-adversarial objective promotes environment-invariant representations, while multi-task learning jointly optimizes cry type recognition, distress intensity estimation, and causal relevance prediction. The model is evaluated on the Baby Chillanto and Donate-a-Cry datasets, with ESC-50 environmental noise overlays for domain augmentation. Experimental results show that DACH-TIC outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, including HTS-AT and SE-ResNet Transformer, achieving improvements of 2.6 percent in accuracy and 2.2 points in macro-F1 score, alongside enhanced causal fidelity. The model generalizes effectively to unseen acoustic environments, with a domain performance gap of only 2.4 percent, demonstrating its suitability for real-world neonatal acoustic monitoring systems.",

While attractive for scalability, LaaJs tend to overlook domain specific issues raising concerns about their reliability in critical evaluation tasks. To better understand these limitations in practice, we examine LaaJ behavior in a concrete industrial use case: legacy code modernization via COBOL code generation. In this setting, we find that even production deployed LaaJs can miss domain critical errors, revealing consistent blind spots in their evaluation capabilities. To better understand these blind spots, we analyze generated COBOL programs and associated LaaJs judgments, drawing on expert knowledge to construct a preliminary taxonomy. Based on this taxonomy, we develop a lightweight analytic checker tool that flags over 30 domain specific issues observed in practice. We use its outputs as analytic hints, dynamically injecting them into the judges prompt to encourage LaaJ to revisit aspects it may have overlooked. Experiments on a test set of 100 programs using four production level LaaJs show that LaaJ alone detects only about 45% of the errors present in the code (in all judges we tested), while the analytic checker alone lacks explanatory depth. When combined, the LaaJ+Hints configuration achieves up to 94% coverage (for the best performing judge and injection prompt) and produces qualitatively richer, more accurate explanations, demonstrating that analytic-LLM hybrids can substantially enhance evaluation reliability in deployed pipelines. We release the dataset and all used prompts.",

Our findings show that LLMs are already widely deployed within scam organizations, with 87% of scam labor consisting of systematized conversational tasks readily susceptible to automation. In a week-long study, an LLM agent not only elicited greater trust from study participants (p=0.007) but also achieved higher compliance with requests than human operators (46% vs. 18% for humans). Meanwhile, popular safety filters detected 0.0% of romance baiting dialogues. Together, these results suggest that romance-baiting scams may be amenable to full-scale LLM automation, while existing defenses remain inadequate to prevent their expansion.",

To address this limitation, we propose CKA Guided Modular Quantization, a fine-tuning-free, plug-and-play framework for algorithmic heterogeneous quantization. Our method independently evaluates multiple PTQ algorithms on each layer and employs Linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) as a metric to automatically select the optimal quantization strategy per layer. The individually optimized strategies are then integrated to construct a hybrid quantized model. Experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms both uniform quantization baselines and state-of-the-art mixed-precision methods across mainstream LLMs including LLaMA and Qwen ,in terms of perplexity (PPL) and downstream task performance.",

        "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted in safety-critical and regulated sectors, the retention of sensitive or prohibited knowledge introduces escalating risks, ranging from privacy leakage to regulatory non-compliance to to potential misuse, and so on. Recent studies suggest that machine unlearning can help ensure deployed models comply with evolving legal, safety, and governance requirements. However, current unlearning techniques assume clean separation between forget and retain datasets, which is challenging in operational settings characterized by highly entangled distributions. In such scenarios, perturbation-based methods often degrade general model utility or fail to ensure safety. To address this, we propose Selective Representation Misdirection for Unlearning (SRMU), a novel principled activation-editing framework that enforces feature-aware and directionally controlled perturbations. Unlike indiscriminate model weights perturbations, SRMU employs a structured misdirection vector with an activation importance map. The goal is to allow SRMU selectively suppresses harmful representations while preserving the utility on benign ones. Experiments are conducted on the widely used WMDP benchmark across low- and high-entanglement configurations. Empirical results reveal that SRMU delivers state-of-the-art unlearning performance with minimal utility losses, and remains effective under 20-30\\% overlap where existing baselines collapse. SRMU provides a robust foundation for safety-driven model governance, privacy compliance, and controlled knowledge removal in the emerging LLM-based applications.

However, this architecture also introduces a new and severe privacy risk, which we term Tools Orchestration Privacy Risk (TOP-R), where an agent, to achieve a benign user goal, autonomously aggregates information fragments across multiple tools and leverages its reasoning capabilities to synthesize unexpected sensitive information. We provide the first systematic study of this risk. First, we establish a formal framework, attributing the risk's root cause to the agent's misaligned objective function: an overoptimization for helpfulness while neglecting privacy awareness. Second, we construct TOP-Bench, comprising paired leakage and benign scenarios, to comprehensively evaluate this risk. To quantify the trade-off between safety and robustness, we introduce the H-Score as a holistic metric. The evaluation results reveal that TOP-R is a severe risk: the average Risk Leakage Rate (RLR) of eight representative models reaches 90.24%, while the average H-Score is merely 0.167, with no model exceeding 0.3. Finally, we propose the Privacy Enhancement Principle (PEP) method, which effectively mitigates TOP-R, reducing the Risk Leakage Rate to 46.58% and significantly improving the H-Score to 0.624. Our work reveals both a new class of risk and inherent structural limitations in current agent architectures, while also offering feasible mitigation strategies.",

Here we present the Pretrained Battery Transformer (PBT), the first FM for battery life prediction, developed through domain-knowledge-encoded mixture-of-expert layers. Validated on the largest public battery life database, PBT learns transferable representations from 13 lithium-ion battery (LIB) datasets, outperforming existing models by an average of 19.8%. With transfer learning, PBT achieves state-of-the-art performance across 15 diverse datasets encompassing various operating conditions, formation protocols, and chemistries of LIBs.

We present Hearing to Translate, the first comprehensive test suite rigorously benchmarking 5 state-of-the-art SpeechLLMs against 16 strong direct and cascade systems that couple leading speech foundation models (SFM), with multilingual LLMs. Our analysis spans 16 benchmarks, 13 language pairs, and 9 challenging conditions, including disfluent, noisy, and long-form speech.

We propose Kascade, a training-free sparse attention method that leverages known observations such as 1) post-softmax attention is intrinsically sparse, and 2) the identity of high-weight keys is stable across nearby layers. Kascade computes exact Top-k indices in a small set of anchor layers, then reuses those indices in intermediate reuse layers. The anchor layers are selected algorithmically, via a dynamic-programming objective that maximizes cross-layer similarity over a development set, allowing easy deployment across models. The method incorporates efficient implementation constraints (e.g. tile-level operations), across both prefill and decode attention. The Top-k selection and reuse in Kascade is head-aware and we show in our experiments that this is critical for high accuracy. Kascade achieves up to 4.1x speedup in decode attention and 2.2x speedup in prefill attention over FlashAttention-3 baseline on H100 GPUs while closely matching dense attention accuracy on long-context benchmarks such as LongBench and AIME-24.",

However, the lack of effective evaluation methodologies has made it difficult to estimate the risk of bias, making deployment of such systems unsafe in high stakes domains such as consumer finance, where biased decisions can translate directly into regulatory breaches and financial loss. To address this challenge, we need to develop fairness evaluation methodologies for multi-agent predictive systems and measure the fairness characteristics of these systems in the financial tabular domain. Examining fairness metrics using large-scale simulations across diverse multi-agent configurations, with varying communication and collaboration mechanisms, we reveal patterns of emergent bias in financial decision-making that cannot be traced to individual agent components, indicating that multi-agent systems may exhibit genuinely collective behaviors. Our findings highlight that fairness risks in financial multi-agent systems represent a significant component of model risk, with tangible impacts on tasks such as credit scoring and income estimation. We advocate that multi-agent decision systems must be evaluated as holistic entities rather than through reductionist analyses of their constituent components.",

Under a fixed evaluation budget, we compare four families of optimizers: two hand-designed evolutionary methods - Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Evolution Strategy (ES) - and two learned, amortized approaches, Preferential Amortized Black-Box Optimization (PABBO) and Sharpness-Aware Black-Box Optimization (SABBO). Our experiments show that, while GA, ES, PABBO, and SABBO eventually reach a similar band of final perplexity, the amortized optimizers are substantially more sample- and time-efficient. SABBO typically identifies a near-optimal topic number after essentially a single evaluation, and PABBO finds competitive configurations within a few evaluations, whereas GA and ES require almost the full budget to approach the same region.",

E-SDS integrates VLMs with real-time terrain sensor analysis to automatically generate reward functions that facilitate training of robust perceptive locomotion policies, grounded by example videos. Evaluated on a Unitree G1 humanoid across four distinct terrains (simple, gaps, obstacles, stairs), E-SDS uniquely enabled successful stair descent, while policies trained with manually-designed rewards or a non-perceptive automated baseline were unable to complete the task. In all terrains, E-SDS also reduced velocity tracking error by 51.9-82.6%. Our framework reduces the human effort of reward design from days to less than two hours while simultaneously producing more robust and capable locomotion policies.",

        "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) is a concept by which objects find identity and can communicate with each other in a network. One of the applications of the IoT is in the field of medicine, which is called the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL) is a type of cancer categorized as a hematic disease. It usually begins in the bone marrow due to the overproduction of immature White Blood Cells (WBCs or leukocytes). Since it has a high rate of spread to other body organs, it is a fatal disease if not diagnosed and treated early. Therefore, for identifying cancerous (ALL) cells in medical diagnostic laboratories, blood, as well as bone marrow smears, are taken by pathologists. However, manual examinations face limitations due to human error risk and time-consuming procedures. So, to tackle the mentioned issues, methods based on Artificial Intelligence (AI), capable of identifying cancer from non-cancer tissue, seem vital. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are the most efficient machine learning (ML) methods. These techniques employ multiple layers to extract higher-level features from the raw input. In this paper, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is applied along with a new type of classifier, Higher Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD), to categorize ALL and normal (healthy) cells from microscopic blood images. We employed the model on IoMT structure to identify leukemia quickly and safely. With the help of this new leukemia classification framework, patients and clinicians can have real-time communication. The model was implemented on the Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Image Database (ALL-IDB2) and achieved an average accuracy of %98.88 in the test step.",

Currently, the field heavily relies on facial expression recognition (FER) because visual channel conveys rich emotional cues. However, facial expressions are often used as social tools rather than manifestations of genuine inner emotions. To understand and bridge this gap between FER and ER, we introduce eye behaviors as an important emotional cue and construct an Eye-behavior-aided Multimodal Emotion Recognition (EMER) dataset. To collect data with genuine emotions, spontaneous emotion induction paradigm is exploited with stimulus material, during which non-invasive eye behavior data, like eye movement sequences and eye fixation maps, is captured together with facial expression videos. To better illustrate the gap between ER and FER, multi-view emotion labels for mutimodal ER and FER are separately annotated. Furthermore, based on the new dataset, we design a simple yet effective Eye-behavior-aided MER Transformer (EMERT) that enhances ER by bridging the emotion gap. EMERT leverages modality-adversarial feature decoupling and a multitask Transformer to model eye behaviors as a strong complement to facial expressions. In the experiment, we introduce seven multimodal benchmark protocols for a variety of comprehensive evaluations of the EMER dataset. The results show that the EMERT outperforms other state-of-the-art multimodal methods by a great margin, revealing the importance of modeling eye behaviors for robust ER. To sum up, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the importance of eye behaviors in ER, advancing the study on addressing the gap between FER and ER for more robust ER performance. Our EMER dataset and the trained EMERT models will be publicly available at this https URL.",

Rather than treating cosmology, astrophysics, geophysics, biology, cognition, and machine intelligence as disjoint domains, we view each as successive regimes of dynamics on ever-richer state spaces, stitched together by phase transitions, symmetry-breaking events, and emergent attractors. Starting from inflationary field dynamics and the growth of primordial perturbations, we describe how gravitational instability sculpts the cosmic web, how dissipative collapse in baryonic matter yields stars and planets, and how planetary-scale geochemical cycles define long-lived nonequilibrium attractors. Within these attractors, we frame the origin of life as the emergence of self-maintaining reaction networks, evolutionary biology as flow on high-dimensional genotype-phenotype-environment manifolds, and brains as adaptive dynamical systems operating near critical surfaces. Human culture and technology-including modern machine learning and artificial intelligence-are then interpreted as symbolic and institutional dynamics that implement and refine engineered learning flows which recursively reshape their own phase space. Throughout, we emphasize recurring mathematical motifs-instability, bifurcation, multiscale coupling, and constrained flows on measure-zero subsets of the accessible state space. Our aim is not to present any new cosmological or biological model, but a cross-scale, theoretical perspective: a way of reading the universe's history as the evolution of dynamics itself, culminating (so far) in biological and artificial systems capable of modeling, predicting, and deliberately perturbing their own future trajectories.",

On Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Thinking, our method removes the refusal behaviour of the model around politically sensitive topics while maintaining safety on JailbreakBench and near-baseline performance on general benchmarks. The approach generalizes across 4B and 80B models and can also induce targeted refusals when desired. We analize the steering vectors and show that refusal signals concentrate in deeper layers of the transformer and are distributed across many dimensions. Together, these results demonstrate that activation steering can remove political refusal behaviour while retaining safety alignment for harmful content, offering a practical path to controllable, transparent moderation at inference time.",

SLHF frames the alignment problem as a sequential-move game between two policies: a Leader, which commits to an action, and a Follower, which responds conditionally on the Leader's action. This approach decomposes preference optimization into a refinement problem for the Follower and an optimization problem against an adversary for the Leader. Unlike Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), which assigns scalar rewards to actions, or Nash Learning from Human Feedback (NLHF), which seeks a simultaneous-move equilibrium, SLHF leverages the asymmetry of sequential play to capture richer preference structures. The sequential design of SLHF naturally enables inference-time refinement, as the Follower learns to improve the Leader's actions, and these refinements can be leveraged through iterative sampling. We compare the solution concepts of SLHF, RLHF, and NLHF, and lay out key advantages in consistency, data sensitivity, and robustness to intransitive preferences. Experiments on large language models demonstrate that SLHF achieves strong alignment across diverse preference datasets, scales from 0.5B to 8B parameters, and yields inference-time refinements that transfer across model families without further fine-tuning.",

Trained DNNs represent valuable assets, often developed through significant investments. However, the ease with which models can be copied, redistributed, or repurposed highlights the urgent need for effective mechanisms to assert and verify model ownership. In this work, we propose an efficient and resilient white-box watermarking framework that embeds ownership information into the internal parameters of a DNN using chaotic sequences. The watermark is generated using a logistic map, a well-known chaotic function, producing a sequence that is sensitive to its initialization parameters. This sequence is injected into the weights of a chosen intermediate layer without requiring structural modifications to the model or degradation in predictive performance. To validate ownership, we introduce a verification process based on a genetic algorithm that recovers the original chaotic parameters by optimizing the similarity between the extracted and regenerated sequences. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through extensive experiments on image classification tasks using MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. The results show that the embedded watermark remains detectable after fine-tuning, with negligible loss in model accuracy. In addition to numerical recovery of the watermark, we perform visual analyses using weight density plots and construct activation-based classifiers to distinguish between original, watermarked, and tampered models. Overall, the proposed method offers a flexible and scalable solution for embedding and verifying model ownership in white-box settings well-suited for real-world scenarios where IP protection is critical.",

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as epistemic partners in everyday reasoning, yet their errors remain predominantly analyzed through predictive metrics rather than through their interpretive effects on human judgment. This study examines how different forms of epistemic failure emerge, are masked, and are tolerated in human AI interaction, where failure is understood as a relational breakdown shaped by model-generated plausibility and human interpretive judgment. We conducted a three round, multi LLM evaluation using interdisciplinary tasks and progressively differentiated assessment frameworks to observe how evaluators interpret model responses across linguistic, epistemic, and credibility dimensions. Our findings show that LLM errors shift from predictive to hermeneutic forms, where linguistic fluency, structural coherence, and superficially plausible citations conceal deeper distortions of meaning. Evaluators frequently conflated criteria such as correctness, relevance, bias, groundedness, and consistency, indicating that human judgment collapses analytical distinctions into intuitive heuristics shaped by form and fluency. Across rounds, we observed a systematic verification burden and cognitive drift. As tasks became denser, evaluators increasingly relied on surface cues, allowing erroneous yet well formed answers to pass as credible. These results suggest that error is not solely a property of model behavior but a co-constructed outcome of generative plausibility and human interpretive shortcuts. Understanding AI epistemic failure therefore requires reframing evaluation as a relational interpretive process, where the boundary between system failure and human miscalibration becomes porous. The study provides implications for LLM assessment, digital literacy, and the design of trustworthy human AI communication.",

While existing NL-to-TL translation frameworks have demonstrated encouraging initial results, these systems either explicitly assume access to accurate atom grounding or suffer from low grounded translation accuracy. In this paper, we propose a framework for Grounding Natural Language Into System Signatures for Temporal Logic translation called GinSign. The framework introduces a grounding model that learns the abstract task of mapping NL spans onto a given system signature: given a lifted NL specification and a system signature $\\mathcal{S}$, the classifier must assign each lifted atomic proposition to an element of the set of signature-defined atoms $\\mathcal{P}$. We decompose the grounding task hierarchically- first predicting predicate labels, then selecting the appropriately typed constant arguments. Decomposing this task from a free-form generation problem into a structured classification problem permits the use of smaller masked language models and eliminates the reliance on expensive LLMs. Experiments across multiple domains show that frameworks which omit grounding tend to produce syntactically correct lifted LTL that is semantically nonequivalent to grounded target expressions, whereas our framework supports downstream model checking and achieves grounded logical-equivalence scores of $95.5\\%$, a $1.4\\times$ improvement over SOTA.",

More precisely, the problem considers two key decisions: (i) whether to deploy additional edge servers or upgrade those already installed, and (ii) how tasks should be offloaded so that the average number of tasks that meet their delay requirement is maximized. The framework specifically involves: (i) deployment of new servers combined with capacity upgrades for existing servers, and (ii) the optimal task offloading to maximize the average number of tasks with a delay requirement. It also considers the following constraints: (i) budget per stage, (ii) server deployment and upgrade cost (in $) and cost depreciation rate, (iii) computation resource of servers, (iv) number of tasks and their growth rate (in %), and (v) the increase in task sizes and stricter delay requirements over time. We present two solutions: a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model and an efficient heuristic algorithm (M-ESU/H). MILP yields the optimal solution for small networks, whereas M-ESU/H is used in large-scale networks. For small networks, the simulation results show that the solution computed by M-ESU/H is within 1.25% of the optimal solution while running several orders of magnitude faster. For large networks, M-ESU/H is compared against three alternative heuristic solutions that consider only server deployment, or giving priority to server deployment or upgrade. Our experiments show that M-ESU/H yields up to 21.57% improvement in task satisfaction under identical budget and demand growth conditions, confirming its scalability and practical value for long-term MEC systems.",

Conventional countermeasures such as fixed power control or static channel hopping are largely ineffective against such adaptive adversaries. This paper presents a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework based on the QMIX algorithm to improve the resilience of swarm communications under reactive jamming. We consider a network of multiple transmitter-receiver pairs sharing channels while a reactive jammer with Markovian threshold dynamics senses aggregate power and reacts accordingly. Each agent jointly selects transmit frequency (channel) and power, and QMIX learns a centralized but factorizable action-value function that enables coordinated yet decentralized execution. We benchmark QMIX against a genie-aided optimal policy in a no-channel-reuse setting, and against local Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and a stateless reactive policy in a more general fading regime with channel reuse enabled. Simulation results show that QMIX rapidly converges to cooperative policies that nearly match the genie-aided bound, while achieving higher throughput and lower jamming incidence than the baselines, thereby demonstrating MARL's effectiveness for securing autonomous swarms in contested environments.",

State-of-the-art approaches decompose the task into a lifting of atomic propositions (APs) phase and a translation phase. However, existing methods struggle with accurate lifting, the existence of co-references, and learning from limited data. In this paper, we propose a framework for NL to TL translation called Grammar Forced Translation (GraFT). The framework is based on the observation that previous work solves both the lifting and translation steps by letting a language model iteratively predict tokens from its full vocabulary. In contrast, GraFT reduces the complexity of both tasks by restricting the set of valid output tokens from the full vocabulary to only a handful in each step. The solution space reduction is obtained by exploiting the unique properties of each problem. We also provide a theoretical justification for why the solution space reduction leads to more efficient learning. We evaluate the effectiveness of GraFT using the CW, GLTL, and Navi benchmarks. Compared with state-of-the-art translation approaches, it can be observed that GraFT the end-to-end translation accuracy by 5.49% and out-of-domain translation accuracy by 14.06% on average.",

In this paper, we present LLMCache, a novel layer-wise caching framework that accelerates transformer inference by reusing intermediate activations based on semantic similarity of input sequences. Unlike prior work, LLMCache is model-agnostic,operates across both encoder and decoder architectures, and supports caching at arbitrary transformer layers. We introduce a lightweight fingerprinting mechanism for matching seman-tically similar inputs and propose adaptive eviction strategies to manage cache staleness. Experiments on BERT and GPT-2 across SQuAD, WikiText-103, and OpenBookQA show up to 3.1 X speedup in inference time with <0.5% accuracy degradation.

Experiments across diverse environments show that LaMer significantly improves performance over RL baselines, with 11%, 14%, and 19% performance gains on Sokoban, MineSweeper and Webshop, respectively. Moreover, LaMer also demonstrates better generalization to more challenging or previously unseen tasks compared to the RL-trained agents.

        "abstract": "The convergence of artificial AI and XR technologies (AI XR) promises innovative applications across many domains. However, the sensitive nature of data (e.g., eye-tracking) used in these systems raises significant privacy concerns, as adversaries can exploit these data and models to infer and leak personal information through membership inference attacks (MIA) and re-identification (RDA) with a high success rate. Researchers have proposed various techniques to mitigate such privacy attacks, including differential privacy (DP). However, AI XR datasets often contain numerous features, and applying DP uniformly can introduce unnecessary noise to less relevant features, degrade model accuracy, and increase inference time, limiting real-time XR deployment. Motivated by this, we propose a novel framework combining explainable AI (XAI) and DP-enabled privacy-preserving mechanisms to defend against privacy attacks. Specifically, we leverage post-hoc explanations to identify the most influential features in AI XR models and selectively apply DP to those features during inference. We evaluate our XAI-guided DP approach on three state-of-the-art AI XR models and three datasets: cybersickness, emotion, and activity classification. Our results show that the proposed method reduces MIA and RDA success rates by up to 43% and 39%, respectively, for cybersickness tasks while preserving model utility with up to 97% accuracy using Transformer models. Furthermore, it improves inference time by up to ~2x compared to traditional DP approaches. To demonstrate practicality, we deploy the XAI-guided DP AI XR models on an HTC VIVE Pro headset and develop a user interface (UI), namely PrivateXR, allowing users to adjust privacy levels (e.g., low, medium, high) while receiving real-time task predictions, protecting user privacy during XR gameplay.",

        "abstract": "Edge machine learning (Edge ML) enables training ML models using the vast data distributed across network edges. However, many existing approaches assume static models trained centrally and then deployed, making them ineffective against unseen data. To address this, Online Edge ML allows models to be trained directly on edge devices and updated continuously with new data. This paper explores a key challenge of Online Edge ML: \"How to determine labels for truly future, unseen data points\". We propose Knowledge Transformation (KT), a hybrid method combining Knowledge Distillation, Active Learning, and causal reasoning. In short, KT acts as the oracle in active learning by transforming knowledge from a teacher model to generate pseudo-labels for training a student model. To verify the validity of the method, we conducted simulation experiments with two setups: (1) using a less stable teacher model and (2) a relatively more stable teacher model. Results indicate that when a stable teacher model is given, the student model can eventually reach its expected maximum performance. KT is potentially beneficial for scenarios that meet the following circumstances: (1) when the teacher's task is generic, which means existing pre-trained models might be adequate for its task, so there will be no need to train the teacher model from scratch; and/or (2) when the label for the student's task is difficult or expensive to acquire.",

        "abstract": "To cope with real-world dynamics, an intelligent system needs to incrementally acquire, update, and exploit knowledge throughout its lifetime. This ability, known as Continual learning, provides a foundation for AI systems to develop themselves adaptively. Catastrophic forgetting is a major challenge to the progress of Continual Learning approaches, where learning a new task usually results in a dramatic performance drop on previously learned ones. Many approaches have emerged to counteract the impact of CF. Most of the proposed approaches can be categorized into five classes: replay-based, regularization-based, optimization-based, representation-based, and architecture-based. In this work, we approach the problem from a different angle, specifically by considering the optimal sequencing of tasks as they are presented to the model. We investigate the role of task sequencing in mitigating CF and propose a method for determining the optimal task order. The proposed method leverages zero-shot scoring algorithms inspired by neural architecture search (NAS). Results demonstrate that intelligent task sequencing can substantially reduce CF. Moreover, when combined with traditional continual learning strategies, sequencing offers enhanced performance and robustness against forgetting. Additionally, the presented approaches can find applications in other fields, such as curriculum learning.",

        "abstract": "The application of Machine Learning (ML) to the diagnosis of rare diseases, such as collagen VI-related dystrophies (COL6-RD), is fundamentally limited by the scarcity and fragmentation of available data. Attempts to expand sampling across hospitals, institutions, or countries with differing regulations face severe privacy, regulatory, and logistical obstacles that are often difficult to overcome. The Federated Learning (FL) provides a promising solution by enabling collaborative model training across decentralized datasets while keeping patient data local and private. Here, we report a novel global FL initiative using the this http URL FL platform, which leverages FL across distributed datasets in two international organizations for the diagnosis of COL6-RD, using collagen VI immunofluorescence microscopy images from patient-derived fibroblast cultures. Our solution resulted in an ML model capable of classifying collagen VI patient images into the three primary pathogenic mechanism groups associated with COL6-RD: exon skipping, glycine substitution, and pseudoexon insertion. This new approach achieved an F1-score of 0.82, outperforming single-organization models (0.57-0.75). These results demonstrate that FL substantially improves diagnostic utility and generalizability compared to isolated institutional models. Beyond enabling more accurate diagnosis, we anticipate that this approach will support the interpretation of variants of uncertain significance and guide the prioritization of sequencing strategies to identify novel pathogenic variants.",

        "abstract": "AI technologies have rapidly moved into business and research applications that involve large text corpora, including computational journalism research and newsroom settings. These models, trained on extant data from various sources, can be conceptualized as historical artifacts that encode decades-old attitudes and stereotypes. This paper investigates one such example trained on the broadly-used New York Times Annotated Corpus to create a multi-label classifier. Our use in research settings surfaced the concerning \"blacks\" thematic topic label. Through quantitative and qualitative means we investigate this label's use in the training corpus, what concepts it might be encoding in the trained classifier, and how those concepts impact our model use. Via the application of explainable AI methods, we find that the \"blacks\" label operates partially as a general \"racism detector\" across some minoritized groups. However, it performs poorly against expectations on modern examples such as COVID-19 era anti-Asian hate stories, and reporting on the Black Lives Matter movement. This case study of interrogating embedded biases in a model reveals how similar applications in newsroom settings can lead to unexpected outputs that could impact a wide variety of potential uses of any large language model-story discovery, audience targeting, summarization, etc. The fundamental tension this exposes for newsrooms is how to adopt AI-enabled workflow tools while reducing the risk of reproducing historical biases in news coverage.",

        "abstract": "Standard practice across domains from robotics to language is to first pretrain a policy on a large-scale demonstration dataset, and then finetune this policy, typically with reinforcement learning (RL), in order to improve performance on deployment domains. This finetuning step has proved critical in achieving human or super-human performance, yet while much attention has been given to developing more effective finetuning algorithms, little attention has been given to ensuring the pretrained policy is an effective initialization for RL finetuning. In this work we seek to understand how the pretrained policy affects finetuning performance, and how to pretrain policies in order to ensure they are effective initializations for finetuning. We first show theoretically that standard behavioral cloning (BC) -- which trains a policy to directly match the actions played by the demonstrator -- can fail to ensure coverage over the demonstrator's actions, a minimal condition necessary for effective RL finetuning. We then show that if, instead of exactly fitting the observed demonstrations, we train a policy to model the posterior distribution of the demonstrator's behavior given the demonstration dataset, we do obtain a policy that ensures coverage over the demonstrator's actions, enabling more effective finetuning. Furthermore, this policy -- which we refer to as the posterior behavioral cloning (PostBC) policy -- achieves this while ensuring pretrained performance is no worse than that of the BC policy. We then show that PostBC is practically implementable with modern generative models in robotic control domains -- relying only on standard supervised learning -- and leads to significantly improved RL finetuning performance on both realistic robotic control benchmarks and real-world robotic manipulation tasks, as compared to standard behavioral cloning.",

        "abstract": "This paper examines the exploration-exploitation trade-off in reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), a framework for improving the reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent studies suggest that RLVR can elicit strong mathematical reasoning in LLMs through two seemingly paradoxical mechanisms: spurious rewards, which suppress exploitation by rewarding outcomes unrelated to the ground truth, and entropy minimization, which suppresses exploration by pushing the model toward more confident and deterministic outputs, highlighting a puzzling dynamic: both discouraging exploitation and discouraging exploration improve reasoning performance, yet the underlying principles that reconcile these effects remain poorly understood. We focus on two fundamental questions: (i) how policy entropy relates to performance, and (ii) whether spurious rewards yield gains, potentially through the interplay of clipping bias and model contamination. Our results show that clipping bias under spurious rewards reduces policy entropy, leading to more confident and deterministic outputs, while entropy minimization alone is insufficient for improvement. We further propose a reward-misalignment model explaining why spurious rewards can enhance performance beyond contaminated settings. Our findings clarify the mechanisms behind spurious-reward benefits and provide principles for more effective RLVR training.",

We study the design space of data, architecture, and control, and introduce \\emph{EasyV2V}, a simple and effective framework for instruction-based video editing. On the data side, we compose existing experts with fast inverses to build diverse video pairs, lift image edit pairs into videos via single-frame supervision and pseudo pairs with shared affine motion, mine dense-captioned clips for video pairs, and add transition supervision to teach how edits unfold. On the model side, we observe that pretrained text-to-video models possess editing capability, motivating a simplified design. Simple sequence concatenation for conditioning with light LoRA fine-tuning suffices to train a strong model. For control, we unify spatiotemporal control via a single mask mechanism and support optional reference images. Overall, EasyV2V works with flexible inputs, e.g., video+text, video+mask+text, video+mask+reference+text, and achieves state-of-the-art video editing results, surpassing concurrent and commercial systems.
